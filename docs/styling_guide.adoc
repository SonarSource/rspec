= Styling Guide

This document provides styling guidelines for `+rule.adoc+` and its dependencies.


The RSPEC styling guide is loosely based on the Associated Press Style and geared to rule descriptions.
The official Associated Press Style should be used as a fall-back for topics not defined here.
The guide might be extended in the future when unanimities emerge.


Following it should be considered a goal to work towards to to get more homogenous texts.
This will be a long process consisting of many baby steps, such as adjusting the style when rule descriptions are rewritten for the Progressive Education Framework.
It is acceptable not to have 100% consistency across all texts. The higher the consistency, the better, but differences are expected.

== Language

Use _American English_ and its notation.

== Acronyms

Do not use acronyms without defining them first unless they are considered well known by the target audience.
For example, the acronym _JDK_ can be considered common knowledge for a Java developer and does not have to be defined.
The definition of what is and is not a well-known acronym is somewhat subjective.
It is up to the reviewers of RSPEC pull requests to challenge the use of acronyms that might not be well known.

If possible and sensible, spell out the acronym on first use and use generic terms on subsequent mentions.
For example, refer to _Cross-Site Scripting_ as _the vulnerability_.

Example:: Cross-Site Scripting allows to inject JavaScript code in the context of a website. The vulnerability can be abused to hijack sessions.

== Contractions

Contractions are considered informal writing and therefore should not be used.

Example:: It is the right way!

== Numbers

In general, spell out numbers one through nine. Use digits for numbers 10 and higher.
Be aware that there are many exceptions to this rule. For instance, use digits for units or percentages.

Example:: 5Â°C is 9% warmer than yesterday.
Example:: The condition checks if the value is greater than eight and smaller than 100.


Commas should be used to group three digits of numbers larger than 999.

Example:: My program creates 1,000,000 forks.

== Punctuation

=== Colon

Do not capitalize the first word after a colon unless it is the start of a sentence or a proper noun.

=== Comma

To avoid ambiguity, add the Oxford comma after the penultimate term in a series of three or more terms.

Example:: My code is slick and works.
Example:: My code is not slow, unreliable, and full of bugs.

=== Parentheses

Parentheses should be avoided. If the information is relevant, it is preferred to incorporate it directly in a sentence.

== Lists

Do not capitalize the first word of list entries unless it is the start of a sentence or a proper noun.

Do not add punctutation for enumerations.

== Code

Only use inline literals (backtick) for direct code references, for instance, variable names or values, or paths. Inline literals should not be used for anything else.

Example:: The function throws exceptions of the type `RuntimeException`.
Example:: Compiling source file `src/generic_file.py` breaks an `assert` call in pytest framework.
