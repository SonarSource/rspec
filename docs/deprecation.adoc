= Deprecation

== In the RSPEC

The rule status (`/status` in the metadata) should be set to `deprecated`.

Optionally, `/extra/replacementRules` can list the rules that replace this rule.

The `superseded` status from Jira has been superseded by the `deprecated` status during transition to RSPEC V2.

== When running ruleAPI

We detect if replacement rules are specified and if they have been implemented or not.

* If they don't exist, the rule is exported as `deprecated`, and a text is added to the description
* If they are specified, but have not been implemented, the rule is not considered as deprecated (its status is set to `ready` during the export).

* If they are specified and implemented, the status remains `deprecated`, and a text mentioning the replacement rules is added to the description.

In all cases, the `/extra/replacementRules` is removed from the metadata available to the analyzer.
