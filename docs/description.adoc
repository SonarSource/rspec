== Sections

There should be no first level titles (`+= Title+`) in your adoc.

The following are the only allowed second level titles for H2:

* Noncompliant Code Example
* Compliant Solution
* See
* See Also
* Exceptions
* Sensitive Code Example
* Ask Yourself Whether
* Recommended Secure Coding Practices
* Deprecated

Third level titles are not checked.

== `quickfix` field

Every active rule that is not a security hotspot must specify the availability of a quick fix for its issues.
`metadata.json` must feature a `quickfix` field with one of the following values:

* `unknown`: the feasibility of producing a quick fix is not evaluated.
* `infeasible`: it is not feasible to propose a quick fix for any of the issues, for whatever reason.
* `targeted`: it is possible to implement quick fixes for this rule, but none are implemented right now.
* `partial`: some of the issues produced by the rule propose a quick fix, but not all.
* `covered`: all the issues produced by the rule propose a quick fix.

[NOTE]
====
A `covered` rule is still not guaranteed to provide a quick fix for a particular issue (for instance, if a fix location would be inside a macro expansion or in a different file from the issue location). The rule is said to have a `partial` quick fix only if there exists a family of issues that cannot have a quick fix.

For instance, on one hand, if a rule detects two functions that are dangerous to use, `A` and `B`, and `A` has an obvious replacement (and therefore a quick fix) while `B` does not, the field should be set to `partial`.

On the other hand, if a quick fix could be easily proposed for both `A` and `B`, but the fix location might be inside a macro expansion, or in a different file from the issue location (and hence not feasible given the current SonarLint capabilities), this should not prevent the rule from being tagged as `covered`.

== Parameters

Parameters should be listed in a subsection `++` as follow:

....
=== Parameters

*name*: TYPE [ `+default value+` ]::
  Description of what the parameter does.

*name2* [ `+another default value+` ]::
  Description of what this second parameter does.

*name3*: TYPE::
  Description of what this third parameter does.

*name4*::
  Description of what this fourth parameter does.

....

Only the parameter name is mandatory, although the description is highly recommended. In all cases, the line should be ended with `+::+` to create a labelled list.

== Comment a rule

Comments and links that were created on Jira have been gathered in a `comments-and-links.adoc` file for each concerned rule. +
You can add a comment anywhere in a rule by adding the following lines in the `*.adoc` file:
[source]

\ifdef::env-github,rspecator-view[]
John Doe (9 Jun 2021, 15:49): my comment on the rule
