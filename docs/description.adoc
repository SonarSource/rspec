= Rule Description

This document describes how `+rule.adoc+` and its dependencies should be structured.

== Sections

There should be no first level titles (`+= Title+`) in your adoc.

The following are the only allowed second level titles for H2:

include::section_names.adoc[]

Third level titles are not checked.

== Parameters

Parameters should be listed in a subsection as follow:

....
=== Parameters

*name*: TYPE [ `+default value+` ]::
  Description of what the parameter does.

*name2* [ `+another default value+` ]::
  Description of what this second parameter does.

*name3*: TYPE::
  Description of what this third parameter does.

*name4*::
  Description of what this fourth parameter does.

....

Only the parameter name is mandatory, although the description is highly recommended. In all cases, the line should be ended with `+::+` to create a labelled list.

The standard way in AsciiDoc to declare an inline block of code is to use enclosed backtick and plus. That is useful when declaring a regex.

== Comment a rule

Comments and links that were created on Jira have been gathered in a `comments-and-links.adoc` file for each concerned rule. +
You can add a comment anywhere in a rule by adding the following lines in the `*.adoc` file:
[source]

This way, your comment will only be visible in GitHub preview and on the Search Page (and will not be visible for the user).
