== Why is it important to define a standard for links?

Rule text often wants to link to blog posts, documentation, and other rules. To provide a consistent experience across the Sonar solution, we want to define standard ways to write links in our rules. This document aims to do that.

== How should you write links?

=== Link formatting:

* Links to documentation: <source> - <title> e.g. SonarQube - SonarScanner for Gradle
* Links to blog posts / news articles: <source> - <title> e.g. Google Security Blog - Moving towards a more secure web
* Links to stackoverflow answers (similar comments in a blog)e.g. StackOverflow - Answer by Stephen Cleary for Best way to handle null task inside async method?
* Link to another Sonar rule: <rulenumber> - <title> e.g. S2755 - XML parsers should not be vulnerable to XXE attacks (note, linking to rules.sonarsource.com)

The hyperlink to the article should be applied to just the document name, with the 'source' being left as plain text. The idea is that this makes it really easy for a user to understand the source before they click on anything.

=== Additional things to consider when adding a link to a rule:
* Is the article (particularly blog posts) likely to be around for at least 6 months?
* Do you trust this source as an 'expert'?
* Link to en_US versions where there is a choice

=== Short form names for sources we regularly use
When web pages have massively long names like "Java™ Platform, Standard Edition 8 API Specification", we will provide short form names that we will use instead. Feel free to add new ones below:
