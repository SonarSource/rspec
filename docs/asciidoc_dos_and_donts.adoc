= AsciiDoc Dos & Don'ts

=== Include

Make sure that `include` statements are surrounded by blank lines.
AsciiDoc will sometimes (depending on the version) trim whitespaces at the beginning and end of the included files. Any adjacent text will thus be stuck to the inlined content, which could lead to display issues like swallowed title tags.

==== Write

----
== Title

include::how-to-fix-it/core.adoc[]

include::how-to-fix-it/symfony.adoc[]
----

==== Avoid

----
== Title
include::how-to-fix-it/core.adoc[]
