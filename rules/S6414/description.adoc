The Google Cloud audit logs service records administrative activities and accesses to Google Cloud resources of the project. It's important to enable audit logs to maintain compliance with security standards and to assist in the event of a security incident. 

Some project members may be exempt from logging their activity in the Google Cloud audit log service, creating a blind spot and reducing the possibility of full investigations.
