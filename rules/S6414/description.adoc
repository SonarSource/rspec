The Google Cloud audit logs service records administrative activities and accesses to Google Cloud resources of the project. It's important to enable audit logs to be able to investigate malicious activities in the event of a security incident. 

Some project members may be exempted from having their activities recorded in the Google Cloud audit log service, creating a blind spot and reducing the capacity to investigate future security events.
