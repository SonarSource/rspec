== Noncompliant Code Example

----

Public Class Foo
    Public Function HelloTime() As String
        Return $"Hello at {DateTime.UtcNow}"
    End Function
End Class

----

== Compliant Solution

There are different approaches to solve this problem. One of them is suggested below. There are also open source libraries (such as NodaTime) which already implement an `IClock` interface and a `FakeClock` testing class.

----

Public Interface IClock
    Function UtcNow() As Date
End Interface

Public Class Foo
    Public Function HelloTime(ByVal clock As IClock) As String
        Return $"Hello at {clock.UtcNow()}"
    End Function
End Class

Public Class FooTest
    Public Class TestClock
        Implements IClock
        ' implement
    End Class

    <Fact>
    Public Sub HelloTime_Gives_CorrectTime()
        Dim dateTime = New DateTime(2017, 06, 11)
        Assert.Equal((New Foo()).HelloTime(New TestClock(dateTime)), $"Hello at {dateTime}")
    End Sub
End Class

----

Another possible solution is using an adaptable module, ideally supports an IDisposable method, that not only adjusts the time behaviour for the current thread only, but also for scope of the using.

----

Public Module Clock
    Public Function UtcNow() As Date
    End Function

    Public Function SetTimeForCurrentThread(ByVal time As Func(Of Date)) As IDisposable
    End Function
End Module

Public Class Foo
    Public Function HelloTime() As String
        Return $"Hello at {Clock.UtcNow()}"
    End Function
End Class

Public Class FooTest
    <Fact>
    Public Sub HelloTime_Gives_CorrectTime()
        Dim dateTime = New DateTime(2017, 06, 11)

        Using SetTimeForCurrentThread(Function() dateTime)
            Assert.Equal((New Foo()).HelloTime(), $"Hello at {dateTime}")
        End Using
    End Sub
End Class
