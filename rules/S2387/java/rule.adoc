== Why is this an issue?

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class Fruit {
  protected Season ripe;
  protected Color flesh;

  // ...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit {
  private boolean ripe;  // Noncompliant
  private static Color FLESH; // Noncompliant
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public class Fruit {
  protected Season ripe;
  protected Color flesh;

  // ...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit {
  private boolean ripened;
  private static Color FLESH_COLOR;

}
----

=== Exceptions

This rule ignores same-name fields that are ``++static++`` in both the parent and child classes. This rule ignores ``++private++`` parent class fields, but in all other such cases, the child class field should be renamed.


[source,java]
----
public class Fruit {
  private Season ripe;
  // ...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit {
  private Season ripe;  // Compliant as parent field 'ripe' is anyway not visible from Raspberry
  // ...
}
