== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class Fruit 
{ 
  protected Season ripe; 
  protected Color flesh; 

  // ... 
} 

public class Raspberry : Fruit 
{ 
  private bool ripe; // Noncompliant 
  private static Color FLESH; // Noncompliant 
} 
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public class Fruit 
{ 
  protected Season ripe; 
  protected Color flesh; 

  // ... 
} 

public class Raspberry : Fruit 
{ 
  private bool ripened; 
  private static Color FLESH_COLOR; 
} 
----

=== Exceptions

This rule ignores same-name fields that are ``++static++`` in both the parent and child classes. It also ignores ``++private++`` parent class fields, but in all other such cases, the child class field should be renamed.


----
public class Fruit 
{
  private Season ripe;
  // ...
}

public class Raspberry : Fruit 
{
  private Season ripe;  // Compliant as parent field 'ripe' is anyway not visible from Raspberry
  // ...
}
