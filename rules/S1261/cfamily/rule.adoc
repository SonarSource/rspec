== Why is this an issue?

----
class B
{
public: 
  virtual int foo();
  virtual int secondFoo();
}
class D : public B
{
public:
  int foo();           //Violation
  virtual int secondFoo();    //Ok
}
----
As well as more intuitive behavior for deep inheritance hierarchies, in that functions that are virtual in a base class will remain virtual in all inherited classes (Readability).
