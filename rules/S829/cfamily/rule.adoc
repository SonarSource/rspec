== Why is this an issue?

Violation of the One Definition Rule (ISO/IEC 14882:2003, ยง3.2) leads to undefined behaviour. In general, this means that the program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or object.


Additionally:

* The definitions of a type shall consist of the same sequence of tokens, and;
* The definitions of a template shall consist of the same sequence of tokens, and;
* The definitions of an inline function shall consist of the same sequence of tokens.

Note that for the purposes of this rule, typedefs shall be treated as types.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
// File a.cpp
struct S1
{
  int32_t i;
};

struct S2
{
  int32_t i;
};

// File b.cpp 
struct S1
{
  int64_t i;
}; // Noncompliant, token sequence different

struct S2
{
 int32_t i;
 int32_t j;
}; // Noncompliant, token sequence different

Correct the multiple declarations of "xxx" so that they have exactly the same token sequences.
