== Why is this an issue?

The ``++java.util.Collection++`` API has methods that accept ``++Object++`` parameters such as ``++Collection.remove(Object o)++``, and ``++Collection.contains(Object o)++``. When the actual type of the object provided to these methods is not consistent with the type declared on the ``++Collection++`` instantiation, those methods will always return ``++false++`` or ``++null++``. This is most likely unintended and hides a design problem.


This rule raises an issue when the type of the argument of the following APIs is unrelated to the type used for the ``++Collection++`` declaration:

* ``++Collection.remove(Object o)++``
* ``++Collection.removeAll(Collection<?>)++``
* ``++Collection.contains(Object o)++``
* ``++List.indexOf(Object o)++``
* ``++List.lastIndexOf(Object o)++``
* ``++Map.containsKey(Object key)++``
* ``++Map.containsValue(Object value)++``
* ``++Map.get(Object key)++``
* ``++Map.getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)++``
* ``++Map.remove(Object key)++``
* ``++Map.remove(Object key, Object value)++``


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class S2175 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String foo = "42";
    Map<Integer, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
    map.remove(foo); // Noncompliant; will return 'null' for sure because 'map' is handling only Integer keys

    // ...

    List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
    Integer integer = Integer.valueOf(1);
    if (list.contains(integer)) { // Noncompliant; always false.
      list.remove(integer); // Noncompliant; list.add(integer) doesn't compile, so this will always return 'false'
    }
  }

}

As I am currently encountering difficulties implementing the rule, I think that expressly mentioning the names of the variables in the issue message does not worth the effort.

Indeed, gathering the names of the variables to build a the proposed message imply several problems: 

* It is costly (and complex) in terms of operations to gather them, and does not provides a lot of information (the issue is already detected on the line, it should not be hard to locate the issue);
* Variables are not always present in expressions manipulating these methods, implying that multiple messages are possible (increasing complexity of the rule as well). As shown in the following code:

----
List<String> getList() {
  return new ArrayList<String>();
}

Integer getIntegerValue() {
  return Integer.valueOf(1);
}

void myMethod() {
  if (getList().contains(getIntegerValue())) {  // Noncompliant. Always false.  <<-- What would be the message
    getList().remove(getIntegerValue()); // Noncompliant. list.add(iger) doesn't compile, so this will always return false  <<-- Same problem
  }
}

I would like to change the message to the following proposition, which I think is much simpler without loosing its pertinence:

____{code}"[class]<[type]>" will not contain any "[ytype]"{code}____

For the previous examples we would then have the syme following message :

____"List<String>" will not contain any "Integer"____

\[~michael.gumowski] how about 

* A "[class]<[type]>" cannot contain a "[ytype]".
* You cannot add a "[ytype]" to a "[class]<[type]>".

The first paragraph of the rule description ends in an incomplete sentence, and it is redundant with the second and third paragraphs. Is it a leftover from revising it, or is there some kind of rendering error here in Jira?


____A couple Collection methods can be called with arguments of an incorrect type, but doing so is pointless and likely the result of using the wrong argument. This rule will raise an issue


The java.util.Collection API is having methods accepting Object as parameter such as Collection.remove(Object o) or Collection.contains(Object o). When the effective type of the object provided to these methods is not consistent with the type declared on the Collection instantiation, those methods will always return false or null. This is most likely unintended and hide a design problem.


This rule raises an issue when the type of the argument of the following APIs is unrelated to the type used for the Collection declaration:
