== How to fix it in PyYAML

=== Code examples

The following code is vulnerable to deserialization attacks because it
deserializes untrusted data without validating it first.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=11,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def unsafe():
    obj = yaml.load(request.args.get("object"), Loader=yaml.Loader)
    return str(obj["status"] == "OK")
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=11,diff-type=compliant]
----
def safe():
    obj = yaml.safe_load(request.args.get("object"))
    return str(obj["status"] == "OK")
----

=== How does this work?

The example compliant solution uses the `safe_load` method in place of the less
secure `load` one. It disables loading arbitrary Python object and thus
prevents the execution of arbitrary or dangerous functions.

Note that the same level of security can be reached with the `load` method as
soon as a safe `Loader` component is passed to it.

yaml.load(untrusted, Loader=yaml.SafeLoader)
