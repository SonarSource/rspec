==== Integrity check

Message authentication codes (MAC) can be used to prevent tampering with
serialized data that is meant to be stored outside the application server:

* On the server-side, when serializing an object, compute a MAC of the
    result and append it to the serialized object string. 
* When the serialized value is submitted back, verify the serialization string
    MAC on the server side before deserialization.

Depending on the situation, two MAC computation modes can be used.

If the same application will be responsible for the MAC computing and
validation, a symmetric signature algorithm can be used. In that case, HMAC
should be preferred, with a strong underlying hash algorithm such as SHA-256.

If multiple parties have to validate the serialized data, an asymetric
signature algorithm should be used. This will reduce the chances for a signing
secret to be leaked. In that case, the `RSASSA-PSS` algorithm can be used.

**Note**: Be sure to store the signing secret securely.
