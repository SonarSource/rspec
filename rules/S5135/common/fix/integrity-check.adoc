==== Integrity check

Message authentication codes (MAC) can be used to prevent tampering with
serialized data that is meant to be stored outside the application server:

* Append a MAC string to the object on the server side with a strong secret before transmitting it, using HMAC.
* When you get it back, verify the object's MAC string on the server side before deserialization.

**Note**: Be sure to store the HMAC secret securely.
