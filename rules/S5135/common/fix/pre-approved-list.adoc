==== Pre-Approved classes

As a last resort, create a list of approved and safe classes that the
application should be able to deserialize. +
If the untrusted class does not match an entry in this list, it should be
rejected because it is considered unsafe.

**Note**: Untrusted classes should be filtered out **during** deserialization,
not after. +
Depending on the language or framework, this should be possible by overriding
the serialization process or using native capabilities to restrict type
deserialization.
