==== Non-constant time authenticity checks

When using a MAC to validate the authenticity of an untrusted serialized
string, it is important to rely on constant time implementations. Indeed,
in most cases, classical string equality check operators work lazily.
As soon as a difference is found between two strings, they consider them
different and return. Their response time will therefore vary depending on
where the first difference has been found.

In security-sensitive contexts, this difference in execution time leaks
information about the secret value being compared. It allows for timing
attacks that could void the authenticity check.
