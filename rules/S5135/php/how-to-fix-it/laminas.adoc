=== How to fix it in Laminas

The following code is vulnerable to deserialization attacks because it
deserializes HTTP data without validating it first.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
$serializer = new Adapter\PhpSerialize();
$session = $serializer->unserialize($_GET['session']); // Non compliant
return new ViewModel([
    "auth" => $session->auth
]);
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
$serializer = new Adapter\Json();
$session = $serializer->unserialize($_COOKIE['session']);
return new ViewModel([
    "auth" => $session['auth']
]);
----

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/introduction.adoc[]

include::../../common/fix/safer-serialization.adoc[]

The example compliant code uses the `Json` adapter to perform the 
deserialization. This one will not perform any automatic object instantiation
and is thus safer than its `PhpSerialize` counterpart.
