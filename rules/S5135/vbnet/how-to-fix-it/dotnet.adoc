== How to fix it in .NET

=== Code examples

The following code is vulnerable to deserialization attacks because it
deserializes HTTP data without validating it first.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class Example
    Inherits Controller

    <HttpPost>
    Public Function Deserialize(InputFile As IFormFile) As ActionResult
        Dim Formatter As New BinaryFormatter()
        Dim ExpectedObject As ExpectedType = CType(Formatter.Deserialize(InputFile.OpenReadStream()), ExpectedType)
    End Function
End Class
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class Example
    Inherits Controller

    <HttpPost>
    Public Function Deserialize(InputFile As IFormFile) As ActionResult
        Dim ExpectedObject As ExpectedType = CType(JsonSerializer.Deserialize(Of ExpectedType)(InputFile.OpenReadStream()), ExpectedType)
    End Function
End Class
----

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/introduction.adoc[]

include::../../common/fix/safer-serialization.adoc[]

include::../../common/fix/integrity-check.adoc[]

include::../../common/fix/pre-approved-list.adoc[]

In the code samples, a pre-approved class is used natively by JsonSerializer to
validate the class during serialization.
XmlSerializer also provides this capability.
**Note**: The pre-approved class should not tamper with the application's inner
workings.

The following native types are considered unsafe because they do not provide
these capabilities:

* `BinaryFormatter`
* `SoapFormatter`
* `NetDataContractSerializer`
* `LosFormatter`
* `ObjectStateFormatter`
