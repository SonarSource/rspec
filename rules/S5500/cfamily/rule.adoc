== Why is this an issue?

Rvalue reference arguments allow the efficient transfer of the ownership of objects.
Therefore, it is expected that rvalue arguments or their subobjects are, conditionally or not, moved into their destination variables.

The ownership is unclear when an rvalue argument, including its subobject or elements, is never moved.
This might lead to bugs and performance issues.

This rule does not apply when the argument is a forwarding reference.

=== Exceptions

For the {cpp}23 or later standard, this rule does not raise issues if the function returns the rvalue reference parameter.
In such cases, the parameter is implicitly moved, and an explicit call to `std::move` is not required:
[source,cpp]
----
Shape updateShape(Shape&& shape) {
  /* ... */
  return shape; // Compliant: implicitly moves shape
}
----

When returning a parameter or variable of rvalue reference type, an implicit move
was introduced in {cpp}20 and retroactively applied to previous standards.
As a consequence, the behavior of such return statements is not consistent across compilers
and standard versions.

Furthermore, with the {cpp}20 rules, the implicit move is not triggered if the function
returns a reference:
[source,cpp]
----
Shape&& updateShape(Shape&& shape) {
  /* ... */
  // C++23: Implicit move, equivalent to `std::move(shape)`
  // C++20: No move and ill-formed as Shape&& reference cannot bound to Shape&
  return shape;
}
----

Due to all of the above, this rule does not treat `return p` as an exception in {cpp} standard before {cpp}23,
and requires the explicit move `return std::move(p)`.

In contrast to returning local (stack) variables, named return value optimization (NRVO)
does not apply to function parameters, so an explicit `std::move` call has no impact on optimizations.

== How to fix it

This issue can be resolved in multiple ways:

// We do not mention std::move_backward or std::ranges::move_backward to keep things simple.
// Those functions are assumed to be less frequently needed.

* Generally, `std::move` can be used to move such arguments;
* For containers, {cpp}20 `std::ranges::move` or {cpp}23 `std::views::as_rvalue` can be used to move their elements;
* It is also possible to use a range-based for loop to move elements.

We illustrate these solutions in the examples below based on the following definitions.

[source,cpp]
----
class Shape {
public:
  Shape(Shape const& shape); // Copy constructor
  Shape(Shape&& shape);      // Move constructor
  // More code...

  bool isVisible() const;
};

class DrawingStore {
  std::vector<Shape> store;

public:
  void insertVisibleShape(Shape&& shape);
  void insertAllShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes);
  void insertAllVisibleShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes);
};

=== How to move an rvalue parameter

==== Noncompliant code example

When the parameter represents a single object you want to move, it is not sufficient to use `&&` after its type in the parameter list.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertVisibleShape(Shape&& shape) {
  if (shape.isVisible()) {
    store.emplace_back(shape); // Noncompliant, call to std::move is expected.
  }
}
----

With the above implementation, the `Shape` object appended in `store` is created using ``Shape``'s _copy_ constructor.

==== Compliant solution

To ensure the object's content is moved, you have to call `std::move()` like this:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertVisibleShape(Shape&& shape) {
  if (shape.isVisible()) {
    store.emplace_back(std::move(shape)); // Compliant
  }
}
----

With this fix, the _move_ constructor of `Shape` is used and the content of the parameter `shape` can be transferred to the newly created object in `store`.

=== How to move elements of a container using for-loops

When you want to transfer the content of multiple objects into another container, it also makes sense to define the parameter as rvalue with `&&`.

==== Noncompliant code example

While the following code looks fine and compiles, it does actually _copy_ the elements. In fact, `shapes` is left unchanged.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  for (Shape& s : shapes) {
    if (s.isVisible()) {
      store.emplace_back(s); // Noncompliant, call to std::move is expected.
    }
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

As in the previous example, a call to `std::move` is required to fix the implementation:

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllVisibleShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  for (Shape& s : shapes) {
    if (s.isVisible()) {
      store.emplace_back(std::move(s)); // Compliant
    }
  }
}
----

// We purposely do not go into the details of "moved-from" states and the fact that `shapes` has still the same number of elements while some of them are in this "moved-from" state.

Writing ``++for (Shape& s : std::move(shapes))++`` would not fix the issue because this call to `std::move` has no effect here.
The call to `std::move` has to be on `s`, not `shapes`.

Notice that in this solution, the for-loop variable `s` remains an lvalue reference with a single `&`.
In {cpp}23, it is possible to make it a rvalue too, with ``++std::ranges::views::as_rvalue++``, making the intent of the code clearer.

// We do not use the shorter form std::views::as_rvalue because libstdc++ does not support it yet.

[source,cpp]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllVisibleShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  for (Shape&& s : shapes | std::ranges::views::as_rvalue) {
    if (s.isVisible()) {
      store.emplace_back(std::move(s)); // Compliant
    }
  }
}
----

=== How to move elements of a container using algorithms

Algorithms, especially with {cpp}20 ranges, are often better alternatives to manual for-loops since they abstract away a lot of implementation details.
However, not all of them abstract away the move semantics and attention is required to use them correctly.

==== Noncompliant code example

For example, `std::ranges::copy` performs copies by default:

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  // Noncompliant: the elements of shapes are not moved.
  std::ranges::copy(shapes, std::back_inserter(store));
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Here, the solution is fairly simple: `std::ranges::copy` can be replaced with `std::ranges::move`.

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  // Compliant: uses "move" instead of "copy".
  std::ranges::move(shapes, std::back_inserter(store));
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

However, sometimes `std::ranges::move` cannot be used, for example when not all elements should be moved.
In this case, `std::ranges::copy_if` looks appropriate but falls short:

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllVisibleShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  // Noncompliant: the elements of shapes are not moved.
  std::ranges::copy_if(
    shapes,
    std::back_inserter(store),
    &Shape::isVisible
  );
}
----

Again, the elements are copied instead of being moved.

==== Compliant solution

While a solution based on ``++std::make_move_iterator++`` exists before {cpp}23, it is fairly verbose and error-prone.
This time again, {cpp}23 ``++std::ranges::views::as_rvalue++`` helps writing regular code:

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
void DrawingStore::insertAllVisibleShapes(std::vector<Shape>&& shapes) {
  // Compliant: use as_rvalue to ensure elements are moved.
  std::ranges::copy_if(
    shapes | std::ranges::views::as_rvalue,
    std::back_inserter(store),
    &Shape::isVisible
  );
}
----

This solution can be applied to any move-compatible algorithm.
