Open redirection occurs when an application uses user-controllable data to redirect users to a URL.

An attacker with malicious intent could manipulate a user to browse into a specially crafted URL, such as ``++https://trusted.com?url=evil.com++``, in order to redirect the victim to his own evil domain.
