=== How to fix it in Java SE

The following code is vulnerable to open redirection as it constructs a URL with user-controllable data. This URL is then used to redirect the user without being first validated.
An attacker can leverage this to manipulate users into performing unwanted redirects.

=== How does this work?

In case the application strictly requires redirecting based on user-controllable data, this could be done using the following alternatives:
1. Using an allow-list approach, in case the destination URLs are limited;
2. Adding a customized page to which users are redirected, warning about the imminent action and requiring manual authorization to proceed.
