=== What is the potential impact?

A web application redirects users to specific URLs based on user-controllable data. An attacker can manipulate a user to perform an HTTP request to the vulnerable web application. The HTTP request contains maliciously injected data that results in the user being redirected to an attacker's controlled evil domain.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various effects of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Domain Mirroring

A malicious link redirects to an attacker's controlled website mirroring the interface of a web application trusted by the user. Due to the similarity in the application appearance and the apparently trustable clicked hyperlink, the user struggles to identify that they are browsing on a malicious domain. Depending on the attacker's purpose, the malicious website can leak credentials, bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and reach any authenticated data or action.

==== Malware Distribution

A malicious link redirects to an attacker's controlled website that serves malware. On the same basis as the domain mirroring exploitation, the attacker develops a spearphishing or phishing campaign with a carefully crafted pretext that would result in the download and potential execution of a hosted malicious file. The worst-case scenario could result in complete system compromise.
