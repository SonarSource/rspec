=== What is the potential impact?

If an attacker tricks a user into opening a link of his choice, the user is
redirected to a domain controlled by the attacker.

From then on, the attacker can perform various malicious actions, some more
impactful than others.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Domain Mirroring

A malicious link redirects to an attacker's controlled website mirroring the
interface of a web application trusted by the user. Due to the similarity in
the application appearance and the apparently trustable clicked hyperlink, the
user struggles to identify that they are browsing on a malicious domain. +

Depending on the attacker's purpose, the malicious website can leak
credentials, bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and reach any
authenticated data or action.

==== Malware Distribution

A malicious link redirects to an attacker's controlled website that serves
malware. On the same basis as the domain mirroring exploitation, the attacker
develops a spearphishing or phishing campaign with a carefully crafted pretext
that would result in the download and potential execution of a hosted malicious
file. +
The worst-case scenario could result in complete system compromise.
