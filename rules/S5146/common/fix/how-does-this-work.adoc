=== How does this work?

In case the application strictly requires redirecting based on user-controllable data, this could be done using the following alternatives:

1. Validating the `authority` part of the URL against a statically defined value (see Pitfalls).
2. Using an allow-list approach, in case the destination URLs are multiple but limited.
3. Adding a customized page to which users are redirected, warning about the imminent action and requiring manual authorization to proceed.
