==== The trap of 'StartsWith' and equivalents

When validating untrusted paths by checking if they start with a trusted folder
name, **ensure that the validation string contains a path separator as the last
character**. +

If the validation string does not contain a terminating path separator, the
Open Redirect vulnerability actually remains; only the exploitation technique
changes.

Thus, a validation like `startsWith("https://example.com")` or an equivalent
with the regex `^https://example\.com.*` unintentionally **keeps the
vulnerability** in the application. It can be exploited with the hostname
`https://example.commit.malicious.io`.
