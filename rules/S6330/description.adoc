Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a managed message queuing service for application-to-application (A2A) communication. Amazon SQS can store messages encrypted as soon as they are received. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium or otherwise leak a message from the file system, for example through a vulnerability in the service, they are not able to access the data.
