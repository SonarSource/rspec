== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

For CfnQueue:

* Omitting "kms_master_key_id" disables SQS queues encryption. Make sure it is safe here.

For Queue:

* Omitting "encryption" disables SQS queues encryption. Make sure it is safe here.
* Setting "encryption" to "QueueEncryption.UNENCRYPTED" disables SQS queues encryption. Make sure it is safe here.
