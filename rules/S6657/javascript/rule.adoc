== Why is this an issue?

Octal escape sequences in string literals have been deprecated since ECMAScript 5 and should not be used in modern JavaScript code.

Many developers may not have experience with this format and may confuse it with the decimal notation. For example, the copyright symbol `"\251"` represents character 169 (decimal) and not 251. 

[source,javascript]
----
var message = "Copyright \251"; // Noncompliant
----

The better way to insert special characters is to use Unicode or hexadecimal escape sequences.

[source,javascript]
----
var message1 = "Copyright \u00A9";  // unicode
var message2 = "Copyright \xA9";    // hexadecimal
