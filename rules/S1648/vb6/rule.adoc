== Why is this an issue?

``++vbNullString++`` is a special constant that denotes a null string (0), while ``++""++`` is a  literal empty string. For most purposes, the two are equivalent, but ``++vbNullString++`` is faster to assign and process, and takes less memory. ``++vbNullString++`` is therefore preferred, however some non-VB APIs or components may not properly handle null strings, and their use should be tested.
