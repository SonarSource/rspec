== Sensitive Code Example

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/[Flask] application with file upload and no size limit:

[source,python]
----
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# No MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH set - no limit on upload size

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']  # Sensitive
    # Process file upload
    return 'File uploaded'
----

== Compliant Solution

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/[Flask] application with file upload size limited to 8 MB:

[source,python]
----
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 8000000  # Compliant: 8 MB

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    # Process file upload
    return 'File uploaded'
