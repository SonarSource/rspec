\[~pierre-loup.tristant], [~csaba.sagi] - based on googling, I see that 8 MB are 8388608 bytes (https://convertlive.com/u/convert/megabytes/to/bytes#8[source])


Even if we set in the default param to 8000000 to be more readable, internally shouldn't we account that people may use the ``++8388608++`` value as well?


(sorry, this was meant for the C# flavor, but it's relevant for the rule in general)
