== Why is this an issue?

A reference to ``++null++`` should never be dereferenced/accessed. Doing so will cause a ``++NullPointerException++`` to be thrown. At best, such an exception will cause abrupt program termination. At worst, it could expose debugging information that would be useful to an attacker, or it could allow an attacker to bypass security measures.



=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
@CheckForNull
String getName() {
  boolean condition = getCondition();
  return condition ? "name" : null;
}

public boolean isNameEmpty() {
  return getName().length() == 0; // Noncompliant; the result of getName() could be null, but isn't null-checked
}
----

[source,java]
----
void paint(Color color) {
  if (color == null) {
    System.out.println("Unable to apply color " + color.toString());  // Noncompliant; NullPointerException will be thrown
    return;
  }
  ...
}
