This rule raises an issue when `System.out.println()` or `System.out.print()` is used in simple programs where the newer `IO.println()` or `IO.print()` methods would be more appropriate.

== Why is this an issue?

Java 25 introduced the `IO` class in the `java.lang` package to provide simpler, more readable methods for basic console operations. Using `IO.println()` instead of `System.out.println()` makes code more straightforward and easier to understand, especially for beginners.

The `IO` class also provides `IO.readln()` for reading input, which further simplifies common console interaction patterns. These methods are particularly beneficial in educational contexts and simple programs where complex I/O operations are not required.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `System.out.println()` instead of `IO.println()` in simple programs reduces code readability and can make Java appear unnecessarily complex to beginners.

== How to fix it

Use `IO.println()` and `IO.readln()` to simplify console operations. The IO class provides cleaner, more readable methods for basic input and output operations.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import java.util.Scanner;

void main() {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
    String name = scanner.nextLine();
    
    System.out.println("Hello " + name + "!"); // Noncompliant
    System.out.println("Welcome to our program."); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void main() {
    String name = IO.readln("Enter your name: ");
    
    IO.println("Hello " + name + "!");
    IO.println("Welcome to our program.");
}
