== Why is this an issue?

Placing an `if` statement on the same line as the closing `}` from a preceding `if`, `else`, or `elseif` block can lead to confusion and potential errors. 
It may indicate a missing `else` statement or create ambiguity for maintainers who might fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

The following code snippet is confusing:

[source,php]
----
if ($condition1) {
  // ...
} if ($condition2) {  // Noncompliant
  //...
}
----

Either the two conditions are unrelated and they should be visually separated:

[source,php]
----
if ($condition1) {
  // ...
}

if ($condition2) {
  //...
}
----

Or they were supposed to be exclusive and you should use `elseif` instead:

[source,php]
----
if ($condition1) {
  // ...
} elseif ($condition2) {
  //...
}
----
