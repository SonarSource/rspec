== Why is this an issue?

When an `if` is placed on the same line as the closing ``++}++`` from a preceding  `if`, `else` or `else if` part, it is either an error - `else` is missing - or the invitation to a future error as maintainers fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

This code is confusing

[source,java]
----
if (condition1) {
  // ...
} if (condition2) {  // Noncompliant
  //...
}
----

Either the two conditions are unrelated and they should be visually separated

[source,java]
----
if (condition1) {
  // ...
}

if (condition2) {
  //...
}
----

Or they were supposed to be exclusive and you should use `else if` instead

[source,java]
----
if (condition1) {
  // ...
} else if (condition2) {
  //...
}
----
