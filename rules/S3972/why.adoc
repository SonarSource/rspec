== Why is this an issue?

Placing an `{if}` statement on the same line as the closing `{closing}` from a preceding `{if}`, `{else}`, or `{elseif}` block can lead to confusion and potential errors. 
It may indicate a missing `{else}` statement or create ambiguity for maintainers who might fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

The following code snippet is confusing:

include::{noncompliantCode}[]

Either the two conditions are unrelated and they should be visually separated:

include::{compliantCodeUnrelated}[]

Or they were supposed to be exclusive and you should use `{elseif}` instead:

include::{compliantCodeExclusive}[]
