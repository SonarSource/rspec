== Why is this an issue?

When an `IF` is placed on the same line as the closing `END` from a preceding  `IF`, `ELSE` or `ELSE IF` part, it is either an error - `ELSE` is missing - or the invitation to a future error as maintainers fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END IF (condition2) BEGIN  -- Noncompliant
  EXEC something
END

Either separate them clearly if they are unrelated

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END

IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
----

or use `ELSE IF` if they should be exclusive


[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END ELSE IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
