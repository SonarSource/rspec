== Why is this an issue?

Placing an `IF` statement on the same line as the closing `END` from a preceding `IF`, `ELSE` or `ELSE IF` block can lead to confusion and potential errors. 
It may indicate a missing `ELSE` statement or create ambiguity for maintainers who might fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

The following code snippet is confusing:

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END IF (condition2) BEGIN  -- Noncompliant
  EXEC something
END
----

Either the two conditions are unrelated and they should be visually separated:

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END

IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
----

Or they were supposed to be exclusive and you should use `ELSE IF` instead:

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END ELSE IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
----
