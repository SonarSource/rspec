== Why is this an issue?

Code is clearest when each statement has its own line. Nonetheless, it is a common pattern to combine on the same line an ``++IF++`` and its resulting _then_ statement. However, when an ``++IF++`` is placed on the same line as the closing ``++END++`` from a preceding ``++ELSE++`` or ``++ELSE IF++``, it is either an error - ``++ELSE++`` is missing - or the invitation to a future error as maintainers fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END IF (condition2) BEGIN  -- Noncompliant
  EXEC something
END
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END ELSE IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
----
Or

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END

IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
