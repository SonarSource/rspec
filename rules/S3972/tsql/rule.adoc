== Why is this an issue?

When an `IF` is placed on the same line as the closing `END` from a preceding  `IF`, `ELSE` or `ELSE IF` part, it is either an error - `ELSE` is missing - or the invitation to a future error as maintainers fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

This code is confusing

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END IF (condition2) BEGIN  -- Noncompliant
  EXEC something
END
----

Either the two conditions are unrelated and they should be visually separated

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END

IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
----

Or they were supposed to be exclusive and you should use `ELSE IF` instead

[source,sql]
----
IF (condition1) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END ELSE IF (condition2) BEGIN
  EXEC something
END
----
