Debug features are special tools or options in software applications that help
developers track down issues, understand application flow, and fix bugs. They
provide a detailed, behind-the-scenes look at the application's operations,
often displaying real-time data, system details, and application configurations.
These features are typically used during the development and testing phases of
the software lifecycle. However, if left enabled in a production environment,
they can pose a security risk. The vulnerability doesn't require specific user
input or action to be exploited; rather, it's the presence of these debug
features in a live environment that creates the potential for a security breach.
