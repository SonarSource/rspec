=== What is the potential impact?

Debug features, while incredibly useful during the development and testing
phases of a software application, can pose significant security risks if left
enabled in a production environment.

==== Unintentional Data Exposure

Debug features often provide detailed information about the application's
operations, including system details, application configurations, and sometimes
even user data.

Debug information can provide attackers with valuable insights into the
application's structure and behavior. This can make it easier for them to
identify and exploit other vulnerabilities in the system. For example, they
might learn about the types of data the application processes, how it interacts
with databases, or how it handles user input, all of which can be used to craft
more effective attacks.

==== Potential for Denial of Service

Some debug features can be resource-intensive, consuming significant amounts of
memory or processing power. If an attacker repeatedly triggers these features,
it could overload the system and lead to a denial of service, where legitimate
users are unable to access the application.
