== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Do not enable debugging features on applications distributed to end users.

== Sensitive Code Example

Setting `isInspectable` to `true` on a `WKWebView` makes it possible to inspect it using Safari's web inspector:

[source,swift]
----
import WebKit

let webView = WKWebView()
webView.isInspectable = true // Sensitive
----

== Compliant Solution

Setting `isInspectable` to `false` ensures that it is not possible for users to inspect the WebView.
[source,swift]
----
import WebKit

let webView = WKWebView()
webView.isInspectable = false
----

If `isInspectable` has to be set to `true` for debugging purposes, it should be done only for `DEBUG` builds.
