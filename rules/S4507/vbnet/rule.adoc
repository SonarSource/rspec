== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Do not enable debug features on production servers.

The .Net Core framework offers multiple features which help during debug. <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDeveloperExceptionPage</code> and <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDatabaseErrorPage</code> are two of them. Make sure that those features are disabled in production.
 Use <code>If env.IsDevelopment()</code> to disable debug code.

== Sensitive Code Example

This rule raises issues when the following .Net Core methods are called: <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDeveloperExceptionPage</code>, <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDatabaseErrorPage</code>. 
----
Imports Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder
Imports Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting

Namespace MyMvcApp
    Public Class Startup
        Public Sub Configure(ByVal app As IApplicationBuilder, ByVal env As IHostingEnvironment)
            ' Those calls are Sensitive because it seems that they will run in production
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage() 'Sensitive
            app.UseDatabaseErrorPage() 'Sensitive
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace

== Compliant Solution

----
Imports Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder
Imports Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting

Namespace MyMvcApp
    Public Class Startup
        Public Sub Configure(ByVal app As IApplicationBuilder, ByVal env As IHostingEnvironment)
            If env.IsDevelopment() Then ' Compliant 
                ' The following calls are ok because they are disabled in production
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage()
                app.UseDatabaseErrorPage()
            End If
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace
