== How to fix it in Flask-GraphQL

=== Code examples

The following code defines a GraphQL endpoint with GraphiQL enabled. While this might be a useful configuration during development, it should never be enabled for applications deployed in production.

==== Sensitive Code Example

[source,python]
----
from flask import Flask
from flask_graphql import GraphQLView

app = Flask(__name__)

app.add_url_rule(
    '/graphql',
    view_func=GraphQLView.as_view(
        'graphql',
        schema=schema,
        graphiql=True # Sensitive
    )
)
----

==== Compliant solution
