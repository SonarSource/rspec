In the application manifest element of an android application, setting ``https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#debug[debuggable]`` property to ``++true++`` could introduce a security risk.


It's more easy to perform reverse engineering and inject arbitrary code in the context of a debuggable application.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* the development of the app is completed and the ``++debuggable++`` property is set to _true_
* the app will be published on the Play Store or distributed in any other ways and the ``++debuggable++`` property is set to _true_

You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is not recommended to release debuggable application. Avoid hardcoding the debug mode in the manifest because the build tool will add the property automatically and assign the correct value depending on the build type.

== Sensitive Code Example

In ``++AndroidManifest.xml++`` the android debuggable property is set to ``++true++``:

----
<application
  android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
  android:supportsRtl="true"
  android:debuggable="true"
  android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
</application>  <!-- Sensitive --> 
----

== Compliant Solution

In ``++AndroidManifest.xml++`` the android debuggable property is set to ``++false++``:

----
<application
  android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
  android:supportsRtl="true"
  android:debuggable="false"
  android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
</application> <!-- Compliant --> 
----
