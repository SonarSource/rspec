Delivering code in production with debug features activated is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1999007[CVE-2018-1999007]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5306[CVE-2015-5306]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2006[CVE-2013-2006]

Debug statements (ones with 'D' or 'd'  in the indicator area) should not be executed in production, but the ``++WITH DEBUGGING MODE++`` clause activates all debug lines, which could expose sensitive information to attackers.
