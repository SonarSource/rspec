This rule is likely not implementable for C#.  ASP.NET Core is not providing
any high level interface to help developper manage uploaded files.

There is no temporary storage of uploaded file by default. The file stays in
memory and it's up to the developper to chose the end location.

Verifying file extention can be done in many different ways.
