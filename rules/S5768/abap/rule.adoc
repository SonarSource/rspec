SAP recommends to keep the result set of any request as small as possible for performance reasons.


A ``++SELECT...ENDSELECT++`` request will retrieve multiple records at the same time. Stopping immediately such a request with a ``++CHECK++``, ``++RETURN++`` or ``++EXIT++`` statement will not reduce the number of retrieved records. If the goal is to retrieve a single record, or check that at least one record exists, it is recommended to add ``++UP TO 1 ROWS++`` or to use ``++SELECT SINGLE++``.


Even if the request already retrieved only one record, adding ``++UP TO 1 ROWS++`` or to using ``++SELECT SINGLE++`` will make the code easier to read.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++SELECT...ENDSELECT++`` which has neither ``++SINGLE++`` nor ``++UP TO 1 ROWS++`` and:

* contains only one statement and it is a ``++CHECK++``, ``++RETURN++`` or ``++EXIT++``
* or when it is completely empty.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,abap]
----
SELECT * FROM sbook INTO ls_book WHERE carrid EQ l_carrid.
    EXIT.
ENDSELECT.
IF sy-subrc NE 0.
    WRITE:/ 'NO RECORD FOUND'.
ENDIF.
----


== Compliant Solution

----
SELECT SINGLE * sbook INTO ls_book WHERE carrid EQ l_carrid.
IF sy-subrc NE 0.
    WRITE:/ 'NO RECORD FOUND'.
ENDIF.
----
