The comma operator (``,``) evaluates its operands, from left to right, and returns the second one. That's useful in some situations, but just wrong in a ``switch`` ``case``. You may think you're compactly handling multiple values in the case, but only the last one in the comma-list will ever be handled. The rest will fall through to the default.

Similarly the logical OR operator (``||``) will not work in a ``switch`` ``case``, only the first argument will be considered at execution time.
