== Why is this an issue?

Since ANSI SQL-92, explicit joins using the ``++JOIN++`` keyword have been possible, and are preferred. Therefore table joins should be done with help of the one of the following clauses: ``++JOIN++``, ``++INNER  JOIN++``, ``++LEFT OUTER  JOIN++``, ``++RIGHT OUTER JOIN++``, and ``++FULL OUTER  JOIN++``. The old way to join tables is deprecated and should not be used anymore.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
SELECT *
FROM PARTS, PRODUCTS
WHERE PARTS.PROD = PRODUCTS.PROD

=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
SELECT *
FROM PARTS
INNER JOIN PRODUCTS ON PARTS.PROD = PRODUCTS.PROD
----
