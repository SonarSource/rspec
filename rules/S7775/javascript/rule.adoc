This rule raises an issue when `String.match()` or `RegExp.exec()` methods are used in boolean contexts where only the existence of a match matters, not the actual match details.

== Why is this an issue?

When you only need to check if a regular expression pattern exists in a string, using `String.match()` or `RegExp.exec()` is inefficient. These methods create and return match objects or arrays containing detailed information about the matches, which requires additional memory allocation and processing time.

The `RegExp.test()` method is specifically designed for boolean checks. It returns `true` if the pattern is found and `false` otherwise, without creating any match objects. This makes it faster and more memory-efficient for simple existence checks.

Using the wrong method can impact performance, especially in loops or frequently executed code paths. It also makes the code less clear about its intent - when you see `test()`, it's immediately obvious that only a boolean result is needed.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `String.match()` or `RegExp.exec()` instead of `RegExp.test()` for boolean checks creates unnecessary performance overhead through extra memory allocation and processing. In performance-critical code or loops, this can lead to measurable slowdowns and increased memory usage.

=== How to fix?


Replace `String.match()` calls with `RegExp.test()` when used in boolean contexts. Move the regular expression to the left side and call `test()` with the string as an argument.
