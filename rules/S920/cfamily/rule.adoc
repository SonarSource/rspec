== Why is this an issue?

When there is only a single condition to test, you have the option of using either a ``++switch++`` statement or an ``++if++``-``++else if++``-``++else++`` statement. For a larger set of potential values, a ``++switch++`` can be easier to read, but when the condition being tested is essentially boolean, then an ``++if++``/``++else++`` statement should be used instead.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
_Bool b = p > 0;
switch (b) { // Noncompliant
...
}
switch (x == 0) { // Noncompliant
...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
_Bool b = p > 0;
if (b) {
...
} else {
...
}
if (x == 0) {
...
} else {
...
}
----

\[~loic.joly] did you see the rule that deprecated this one? It seems to me that it is a more clearly-worded semantic equivalent.
