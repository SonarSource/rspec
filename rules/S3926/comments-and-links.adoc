\[~amaury.leve] I've done a rather heavy edit. Please double-check me. In particular, I've updated _where_ (and therefore _how many_) issues should be raised. I've also tried to clarify some language that was initially unclear to me. Please verify that the description still says what it should.

I am not a big fan of reporting on the ``++OptionalField++`` field because if the class has multiples fields with this attribute we should still report only once. The event handler method is going to take care of all parameters at once.


I would get back to reporting on the class itself. WDYT?
