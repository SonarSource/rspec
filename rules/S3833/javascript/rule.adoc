== Why is this an issue?

In the constructor of a derived class, accessing ``++this++`` or ``++super++`` before ``++super()++`` is called raises a reference error. ``++super()++`` should always be called first.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
class Bar {
}

class Foo extends Bar {
    constructor() {
        this.val = 0;   // Noncompliant
        super();
    }
}

class Foobar extends Foo {
    constructor() {
        super.val = 1;   // Noncompliant
        super();
    }
}

----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
class Bar {
}

class Foo extends Bar {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.val = 0;
    }
}

class Foobar extends Foo {
    constructor() {
        super();
        super.val = 1;
    }
}
