== Why is this an issue?

When a collection is empty it makes no sense to access or iterate it. Doing so anyway is surely an error; either population was accidentally omitted or the developer doesn't understand the situation.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
let strings = [];

if (strings.includes("foo")) {}  // Noncompliant

for (str of strings) {}  // Noncompliant

strings.forEach(str => doSomething(str)); // Noncompliant
----
ifdef::env-github,rspecator-view[]
