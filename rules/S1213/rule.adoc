According to the Java Code Conventions as defined by Oracle, the members of a class or interface declaration should appear in the following order in the source files:


* Class variables
* Instance variables
* Constructors
* Methods


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class Foo{ 
   private int field = 0;
   public boolean isTrue() {...}     
   public Foo() {...}                         // Noncompliant, constructor defined after methods
   public static final int OPEN = 4;  //Noncompliant, variable defined after constructors and methods
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public class Foo{ 
   public static final int OPEN = 4;
   private int field = 0;
   public Foo() {...}
   public boolean isTrue() {...}
}
