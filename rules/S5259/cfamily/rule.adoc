Include guards, wrapping around the entire content of a header file, are a best practice that ensure that no matter how many times the header is actually included in a translation unit, its content will only be seen once. 


The include guard pattern is made up of four parts:

* ``++#ifndef++`` at the top of the file, with a unique macro name (usually the name relates to the name of the file, to ensure uniqueness).
* ``++#define++`` with the same macro name.
* The content of the file
* ``++#endif++`` at the end of the file

The rule raises an issue when the name in the second part differs from the name in the first (usually because of a typo or a copy/paste issue).
