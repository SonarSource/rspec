== Why is this an issue?

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing[Routing] in ASP.NET MVC maps https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/actions#what-is-a-controller[controllers] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/actions#defining-actions[actions] to paths in request https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[URIs].

When an action defines a route template starting with a "/", the action route is considered absolute and the action is registered at the root route of the web application.

In such a scenario, any route defined at the controller level is disregarded, as shown in the following example:

include::{language}/why-example.adoc[]

The behavior can be found confusing and surprising because any relative action route is relativized to the controller route.

Therefore, in the vast majority of scenarios, controllers group all related actions not only in the source code, but also at the routing level.

It is then a good practice to avoid absolute routing at the action level and move the "/" at the root level, changing the template defined in the `RouteAttribute` of the controller appropriately.
