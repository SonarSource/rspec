When you run an OS command, it is always important to protect yourself against
the risk of accidental or malicious replacement of the executables in the
production system.

To do so, the methodology consists in verifying and being intentional about
whether the executable that is going to be used **is actually** the one you
expect to be used.

For example, if you call ``++git++`` (without specifying a path), the operating
system will search for the executable in the directories specified in the
``++PATH++`` environment variable. +
An attacker could have added, in a permissive directory covered by ``++PATH++``
, another executable called ``++git++``, but with a completely different
behavior, for example exfiltrating data or exploiting a vulnerability in your
own code.

However, if you call ``++/usr/bin/git++`` or ``++../git++`` (relative path)
directly, the operating system will intentionally use the executable you intend
to use. +
Note that you still need to make sure that the executable is not world-writeable
and potentially overwritten. This is not the scope of this rule.
