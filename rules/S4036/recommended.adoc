== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

If you wish to rely on the ``++PATH++`` environment variable to locate the OS
command, make sure that each of its listed directories is fixed, not susceptible
to change, and not writable by unprivileged users.

If you determine that these folders cannot be altered, and that you are sure
that the program you intended to use will be used, then you can determine
that these risks are under your control.

A good practice you can use is to also hardcode the ``++PATH++`` variable you
want to use, if you can do so in the framework you use.

If the previous recommendations cannot be followed due to their complexity 
or other requirements, then consider using the absolute
path of the command instead.
