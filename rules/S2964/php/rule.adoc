== Why is this an issue?

``++sleep++`` is sometimes used in a mistaken attempt to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by throttling response rate. But because it ties up a thread, each request takes longer to serve that it otherwise would, making the application _more_ vulnerable to DoS attacks, rather than less.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
if (is_bad_ip($requester)) {
  sleep(5);  // Noncompliant
}
----
