== Why is this an issue?

Python interprets ``++False++`` as a "false" boolean value, and ``++True++`` as a "true" boolean value. Assigning them other values could lead to unexpected behaviors.


This rule raises an issue when "True" and "False", with any case, are used as identifiers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
True = "red"  # Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
color = "red"  # Noncompliant
