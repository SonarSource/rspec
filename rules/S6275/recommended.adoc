== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to encrypt EBS volumes that contain sensitive information. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently by EC2, so no further modifications to the application are necessary. Instead of enabling encryption for every volume, it is also possible to enable encryption globally for a specific region. While creating volumes from encrypted snapshots will result in them being encrypted, explicitly enabling this security parameter will prevent any future unexpected security downgrade.
