\[~ann.campbell.2] This rule is deprecated in favor of RSPEC-1110. However, the scope of RSPEC-1110 was reduced. Should we still deprecate this rule?

Indeed [~pierre-yves.nicolas] and [~ann.campbell.2], I don't think there is any remaining overlap between this rule and RSPEC-1110.

This rule is deprecated because it raises mostly false positives on tuples and unpacking. Ex: `return (a,b)` or `for (a,b) in x:`

Also it provides very little value as there can be cases when parentheses improve readability.


Some cases deserve dedicated rules:

* S5905 "Assert should not be called on a tuple literal": it is a common bug, not a code smell.
* A rule should be created later to detect when single element tuple was intended. ex: `a = (b)` when developer probably wanted `a = (b,)`
