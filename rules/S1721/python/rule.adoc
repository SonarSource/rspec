Parentheses are not required after the ``++assert++``, ``++del++``, ``++elif++``, ``++except++``, ``++for++``, ``++if++``, ``++in++``, ``++not++``, ``++raise++``, ``++return++``, ``++while++``, and ``++yield++`` keywords, and using them unnecessarily impairs readability. They should therefore be omitted.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
x = 1
while (x < 10):
    print "x is now %d" % (x)
    x += 1
----


== Compliant Solution

----
x = 1
while x < 10:
    print "x is now %d" % (x)
    x += 1
