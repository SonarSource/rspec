== Why is this an issue?

Parentheses are not required after the ``++assert++``, ``++del++``, ``++elif++``, ``++except++``, ``++for++``, ``++if++``, ``++not++``, ``++raise++``, ``++return++``, ``++while++``, and ``++yield++`` keywords. Similarly, parentheses are not required after ``++in++`` in a ``++for++`` loop. Using parentheses unnecessarily impairs readability, and therefore, they should be omitted.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
x = 1
while (x < 10):
    print "x is now %d" % (x)
    x += 1

=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
x = 1
while x < 10:
    print "x is now %d" % (x)
    x += 1

Indeed [~pierre-yves.nicolas] and [~ann.campbell.2], I don't think there is any remaining overlap between this rule and RSPEC-1110.

This rule is deprecated because it raises mostly false positives on tuples and unpacking. Ex: `return (a,b)` or `for (a,b) in x:`

Also it provides very little value as there can be cases when parentheses improve readability.


Some cases deserve dedicated rules:

* S5905 "Assert should not be called on a tuple literal": it is a common bug, not a code smell.
* A rule should be created later to detect when single element tuple was intended. ex: `a = (b)` when developer probably wanted `a = (b,)`
