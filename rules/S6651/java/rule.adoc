== Why is this an issue?

Conditional expressions which are always `true` or `false` can lead to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreachable_code[unreachable code].

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
a = false;
if (a) { // Noncompliant
  doSomething(); // never executed
}

if (!a || b) { // Noncompliant; "!a" is always "true", "b" is never evaluated
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomethingElse(); // never executed
}
