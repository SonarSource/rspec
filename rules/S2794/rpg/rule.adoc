== Why is this an issue?

The use of a result data structure with file I/O improves performance because it moves the data in one large block from file to data structure (or vice versa) rather than field by field. 


Additionally using a data structure can limit the problems caused by having bad data in a file. Without a data structure, the entire ``++READ++`` operation will fail at the first bad value. With one, the error comes only when the bad field is used.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,rpg]
----
     F MyFile   IF   E             Disk
       * Noncompliant
     C                   READ      Record1
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,rpg]
----
     F MyFile   IF   E             Disk

     D InputData       DS                  LikeRec(Record1)
     C                   READ      Record1       InputData
