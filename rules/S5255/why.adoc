== Why is this an issue?

If a page contains multiple ``++<nav>++`` or ``++<aside>++`` elements, each one should have an ``++aria-label++`` or ``++aria-labelledby++`` attribute so that they can be differentiated. The same rule applies when multiple elements have a ``++role++`` attribute with the same "landmark" value.


Landmark roles are: ``++banner++``, ``++complementary++``, ``++contentinfo++``, ``++form++``, ``++main++``, ``++navigation++``, ``++search++``, ``++application++``. 


The use of ARIA markup helps users of screen readers navigate across blocks of content. For example it makes groups of links easier to locate or skip.
