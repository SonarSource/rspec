== Why is this an issue?

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in Electron applications 
enables communication between the main process and renderer 
processes. The main process typically has higher privileges 
and greater access to system resources. Since any Web Frame
has the potential to make IPC calls, not securing IPC calls
opens up vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious
actors to compromise the main process.

=== What is the potential impact?

Failing to validate the senders of IPC messages in Electron applications 
can have severe consequences, including:

==== Arbitrary Code Execution
Unvalidated IPC messages can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary 
code, potentially leading to full system compromise.

==== Data Leakage
Sensitive information can be intercepted or exfiltrated by 
unauthorized entities, resulting in data breaches and loss of confidentiality.

==== Privilege Escalation
Malicious actors can leverage unvalidated IPC messages 
to gain elevated privileges within the application, allowing them to perform 
actions beyond their intended permissions.


== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
ipcMain.handle('get-sensitive-data', (event) => { // Noncompliant
  return getSensitiveData()
})
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
ipcMain.handle('get-sensitive-data', (event) => {
  if (validateSenderFrame(event.senderFrame)) {
    return getSensitiveData()
  } else {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized access')
  }
})

function validateSenderFrame(senderFrame) {
  const senderUrl = new URL(senderFrame.url)
  return (senderUrl.hostname === 'safe.example.org'
        && senderUrl.protocol === 'https:'
        && senderUrl.port === '')
}
----

=== How does this work?

In the given example, the compliant code verifies that the URL
of the sender frame is pointing to a trusted resource.
The verification takes into account the protocol to make sure
that only securely obtained web content can obtain sensitive data.
Additionally, the host name and port are checked (in the given example 
it is checked, that the URL does not specify a port, so that 
443, the default port for HTTPS will be used).

If you're app is loading files using the `file` protocol, than the path
of the loaded file should be validated to make sure that only the intended
files can successful make IPC calls. The following code shows how the path
of a sender can be verified:

[source,javascript]
----
const url = require('url')

function validateSenderFrame(senderFrame) {
  const senderUrl = new URL(senderFrame.url)
  return senderUrl.protocol === 'file:'
        && url.fileUrlToPath(senderUrl).startsWith('/trusted/folder')
}
----


=== Pitfalls

Instead of using `event.senderFrame.url` it might be tempting to use 
`event.sender.getUrl()` for validation. However, if an iframe on a page
makes an IPC call, the `event.sender` property will contain the properties
of the parent. So if an iframe is embedded in the web page obtained from 
`https://example.org`, and this iframe makes an IPC call, `event.sender.getUrl()`
will return `https://example.org` regardless of which URL was used to obtain the
resource loaded in the iframe.
