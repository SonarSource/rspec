When parsing a script node, the browser treats its contents as plain text, and immediately finishes parsing when it finds the first closing ``++</script>++`` character sequence.

As a consequence, nested script nodes are not possible, because all opening ``++<script>++`` tags found along the way are ignored. 


Web browsers doesn't support nested ``++<script>...</script>++`` elements. But there is no error in such case and browsers just close the first encountered ``++<script>++`` tag as soon as a closing ``++</script>++`` tag is found along the way. So there is a big chance to display something totally unexpected to the end-users.
