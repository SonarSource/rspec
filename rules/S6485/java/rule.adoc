Hash-based collections with known capacity should be initialized with the proper related static method.

== Why is this an issue?

When creating an instance of HashMap or HashSet, the developer can pick a constructor with known capacity.
However, the requested capacity is not fully allocated by default.
Indeed, when the collection reaches the load factor of the collection (default: 0.75), the collection is resized on the fly, leading to unexpected performance issues.

== How to fix it

As of Java 19, hash-based collections provide a static method that allocates the requested capacity at construction time.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
private static final int KNOWN_CAPACITY = 1_000_000;

public static Map<String, Integer> buildAMap() {
    return new HashMap<>(KNOWN_CAPACITY); // Noncompliant
}

public static Set<String> buildASet() {
    return new HashSet<>(KNOWN_CAPACITY); // Noncompliant
}

----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
private static final int KNOWN_CAPACITY = 1_000_000;

public static Map<String, Integer> buildABetterMap() {
    return HashMap.newHashMap(KNOWN_CAPACITY);
}

public static Set<String> buildABetterSet() {
    return HashSet.newHashSet(KNOWN_CAPACITY);
}

public static Set<String> buildABetterSet(float customLoadFactor) {
    return new HashSet<>(KNOWN_CAPACITY, customLoadFactor);
}

Replace this call to the constructor with the better suited static method.
