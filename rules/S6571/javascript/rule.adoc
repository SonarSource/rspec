In unions and intersections, redundant types should not be used.

== Why is this an issue?

When creating a union or intersection of types in TypeScript, it is possible for certain constituents to clash with one another. For instance, if the type `any` is included in a union, it takes precedence over all other constituents and causes the union to become the most generic type, which is `any`. Similarly, if a type that is more restrictive than another type, like `1` for `number`, is included in an intersection, it will take precedence over the other type and override it.

On the other hand, some types do not have any impact when they are included in a union or intersection, like `never` in a union or `unknown` in an intersection.

Eliminating any superfluous or overridden types from a union or intersection type can simplify the code and enhance its readability. Moreover, it will provide a clearer representation of the actual values that a variable is capable of holding.

== How to fix it

The redundant and overridden types should be removed.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
type UnionWithAny = any | 'redundant'; // Noncompliant
type UnionWithNever = never | 'override'; // Noncompliant
type UnionWithLiteral = number | 1; // Noncompliant

type IntersectionWithAny = any & 'redundant'; // Noncompliant
type IntersectionWithUnknown = string & unknown; // Noncompliant
type IntersectionWithLiteral = string & 'override'; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,text,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
type UnionWithAny = any;
type UnionWithNever = never;
type UnionWithLiteral = number;

type IntersectionWithAny = any;
type IntersectionWithUnknown = string;
type IntersectionWithLiteral = 'override';
