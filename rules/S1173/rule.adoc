== Why is this an issue?

Names should be self-descriptive and this can't be the case when they are made of less than 3 characters.

Two-letter English words such as "is", "as", "of", etc. are allowed.


Local variables are not verified by this rule.


The following code snippet illustrates this rule:


----
public class A {                            // Non-Compliant

  public int convert(String a) {            // Non-Compliant
    for (int i = 0; i < 42 ; i++) {         // Compliant - local variable
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  public void a() {                         // Non-Compliant
    int i = 0;                              // Compliant - local variable
    try {
      /* ... */
    } catch (Exception e) {                 // Compliant - local variable
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  private boolean is(Object a) {            // Compliant - two-letter English word
    /* ... */
  }
}
