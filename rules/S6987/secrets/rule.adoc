== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

If an attacker gains access to a Docker swarm token, they might be able to add new workers or managers to the swarm.

=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker with control over a manager or worker node might be able to access sensitive information pushed to those malicious nodes. If the compromised token allows joining a
manager node to the swarm, this one could compromise other legitimate nodes by pushing
malicious tasks to them.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
SwarmJoin swarmJoin = new SwarmJoin();

swarmJoin.getRemoteAddrs().add("103.214.142.16:2377");
swarmJoin.setJoinToken("SWMTKN-1-0o98pf607edyse6ncy7j3z5tjz5ehz6wdmmlevttk55nkgpyh1-pq3hfd1utmhpjnd5hvom0z6va");
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
SwarmJoin swarmJoin = new SwarmJoin();

swarmJoin.getRemoteAddrs().add("103.214.142.16:2377");
swarmJoin.setJoinToken(System.getenv("JOIN_TOKEN"));
