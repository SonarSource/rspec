In most databases, the SQL ``++TRUNCATE++`` statement has the following side effects:

* The table being truncated is locked during the operation
* The transaction log is not updated during the operation, which means that a TRUNCATE operation can't be part of a transaction.
* ``++DELETE++`` triggers are not fired during truncation

For these reasons use of the ``++TRUNCATE++`` statement may not be permitted in some environments. This rule flags all uses of the ``++TRUNCATE++`` statement.
