When a reluctant (or lazy) quantifier is followed by a pattern that can match the empty string or directly by the end of the regex, it will always match zero times for `+*?+` or one time for `++?+`. If a reluctant quantifier is followed directly by the end anchor (`+$+`), it  behaves indistinguishably from a greedy quantifier while being less efficient.

This is likely a sign that the regex does not work as intended.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
str.split(/.*?x?/); // Noncompliant, this will behave just like "x?"
/^.*?$/.test(str); // Noncompliant, replace with ".*"
----


== Compliant Solution

----
str.split(/.*?x/);
/^.*$/.test(str);
----
