When a reluctant (or lazy) quantifier is followed by a pattern that can match the empty string or directly by the end of the regex, it will always match zero times for `+*?+` or one time for `++?+`. If a reluctant quantifier is followed directly by the end anchor (`+$+`), it  behaves indistinguishably from a greedy quantifier while being less efficient.

This is likely a sign that the regex does not work as intended.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
preg_match("/.*?x?/", $str); // Noncompliant, this will behave just like "x?"
preg_match("/.*?/", $str); // Noncompliant, replace with "."
----


== Compliant Solution

----
preg_match("/.*?x/", $str);
preg_match("/.*/", $str);
----
