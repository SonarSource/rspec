== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

This rule applies to both private and public class fields. In JavaScript, you can define private class members by using a hash `#` prefix. This feature was added in ES2022.

The following type of getters and setters are supported:

* `getX()` and `setX()`
* `get x()` and `set x()`
* Getters and setters defined with `Object.defineProperty()`

[source,javascript]
----
class A {
  x: number = 0;
  #y: number = 0;

  get x() { // Noncompliant: field 'x' is not used in the return value
    return this.#y;
  }

  setY(val: number) { // Noncompliant: field '#y' is not updated
  }
}
----

The rule is enforced only if the property with the corresponding name exists, like `x` for `getX()`. Underscore prefixes for fields are supported, so `setX()` can assign a value to `_x`.

Getters should access the field with the corresponding name. Setters should update it.

[source,javascript]
----
class A {
  _x: number = 0;
  #y: number = 0;

  get x() {
    return this._x;
  }

  set x(val: number) {
    this._x = val;
  }

  getY() {
    return this.#y;
  }

  setY(val: number) {
    this.#y = val;
  }
}
----
