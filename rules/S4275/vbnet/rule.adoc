Properties provide a way to enforce encapsulation by providing ``++public++``, ``++protected++`` or ``++internal++`` methods that give controlled access to ``++private++`` fields. However in classes with multiple fields it is not unusual that cut and paste is used to quickly create the needed properties, which can result in the wrong field being accessed by a getter or setter.


This rule raises an issue in any of these cases:

* A setter does not update the field with the corresponding name.
* A getter does not access the field with the corresponding name.

For simple properties it is better to use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/auto-implemented-properties[auto-implemented properties] (VB.NET 10.0 or later). 


Field and property names are compared as case-insensitive. All underscore characters are ignored.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Class A
    Private x As Integer
    Private y As Integer

    Public Property X As Integer
        Get
            Return x
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As Integer)
            x = value
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Property Y As Integer
        Get  ' Noncompliant: field 'y' is not used in the return value
            Return x
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As Integer) ' Noncompliant: field 'y' is not updated
            x = value
        End Set
    End Property
End Class

Class A
    Private x As Integer
    Private y As Integer

    Public Property X As Integer
        Get
            Return x
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As Integer)
            x = value
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Property Y As Integer
        Get
            Return y
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As Integer)
            y = value
        End Set
    End Property
End Class
