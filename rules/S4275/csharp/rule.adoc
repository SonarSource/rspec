== Why is this an issue?

Properties provide a way to enforce encapsulation by providing accessors that give controlled access to `private` fields. However, in classes with multiple fields, it is not unusual that cut and paste is used to quickly create the needed properties, which can result in the wrong field being accessed by a getter or setter.

This rule raises an issue in any of these cases:

* A getter does not access the field with the corresponding name.
* A setter does not update the field with the corresponding name.

For simple properties, it is better to use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties[auto-implemented properties] (C# 3.0 or later).

Field and property names are compared as case-insensitive. All underscore characters are ignored.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class A
{
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public int X
    {
        get { return x; }
        set { x = value; }
    }

    public int Y
    {
        get { return x; }  // Noncompliant: field 'y' is not used in the return value
        set { x = value; } // Noncompliant: field 'y' is not updated
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class A
{
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public int X
    {
        get { return x; }
        set { x = value; }
    }

    public int Y
    {
        get { return y; }
        set { y = value; }
    }
}
