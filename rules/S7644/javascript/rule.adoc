This rule raises an issue when a class decorated with `@Component` does not end with the expected suffix (by default "Component").

== Why is this an issue?

Consistent naming conventions make Angular applications easier to understand and maintain. When component classes follow a predictable naming pattern, developers can quickly identify the purpose and type of each class.

In Angular applications, components are fundamental building blocks that define UI elements and their behavior. Having a clear naming convention helps distinguish components from other types of classes like services, pipes, or directives.

While the Angular team no longer strictly recommends this convention as of version 20, many teams still find value in maintaining consistent naming patterns across their codebase. This consistency becomes especially important in larger applications where multiple developers work on the same codebase.

Without consistent naming, developers may struggle to understand the codebase structure, leading to confusion and potential maintenance issues. A class named `UserProfile` could be a component, service, or model - but `UserProfileComponent` clearly indicates its role.

=== What is the potential impact?

Inconsistent naming conventions can lead to:

* Reduced code readability and maintainability
* Confusion for team members about class purposes
* Difficulty in code navigation and understanding
* Inconsistent codebase structure that becomes harder to scale

=== How to fix in Angular?

Add the expected suffix to your component class name. By default, use "Component" as the suffix.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-profile'
})
class UserProfile { // Noncompliant
  // component logic
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-profile'
})
class UserProfileComponent {
  // component logic
}
----

When using custom suffixes, ensure your component class name ends with one of the configured suffixes.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// Configuration: suffixes: ["Page", "View"]
@Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard'
})
class Dashboard { // Noncompliant
  // component logic
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Configuration: suffixes: ["Page", "View"]
@Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard'
})
class DashboardPage {
  // component logic
}
----
