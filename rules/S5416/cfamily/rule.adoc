== Why is this an issue?

Since {cpp}11, type aliases can be declared via ``++using++`` or ``++typedef++``. ``++using++`` should be preferred as  more readable because you see the new name/alias first.

In addition, ``++using++`` can be templated, which makes it applicable to more situations than ``++typedef++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
typedef void (*FunctionPointerType)(int);
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
using FunctionPointerType = void (*)(int);
----
