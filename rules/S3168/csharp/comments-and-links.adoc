\[~tamas.vajk] I don't understand the code snippets. The ``++async Task++`` method doesn't return anything.


Also, could you morph the Noncompliant Example into a Compliant Solution, please?

A method with ``++async++`` keyword returning a ``++Task++`` is like a non ``++async++`` method with ``++void++`` return type. Similarly in an ``++async Task<int>++`` method we can return a simple ``++int++``. (\https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh524395.aspx)

\[~tamas.vajk] that makes me wonder if we should generalize this rule to catch _any_ ``++async++`` method that does not return a ``++Task++``...?

\[~ann.campbell.2] That's a compiler error (CS1983, _The return type of async must be void, Task or Task<T>_).
