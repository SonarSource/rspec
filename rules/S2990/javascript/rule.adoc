== Why is this an issue?

When a function is called without an explicit object context, the `this` keyword refers to the global object. This also applies when it is used outside of an object. The global `this` object refers to the global context in which the JavaScript code is executed. This can cause problems when the code is executed in different contexts, such as in a browser or in a Node.js environment, where the global object is different. Such uses could be confusing to maintainers as the actual value depends on the execution context and it can be unclear what object the "this" keyword is referring to.

In JavaScript "strict mode" the global "this" will always be `undefined`.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
this.foo = 1;   // Noncompliant: 'this' refers to global 'this'
console.log(this.foo); // Noncompliant: 'this' refers to global 'this'

function MyObj() { 
  this.foo = 1; // Compliant 
} 

MyObj.func1 = function() { 
  if (this.foo == 1) { // Compliant
    // ... 
  } 
} 
----

Instead, simply drop the ``++this++``, or replace it with ``++globalThis++``. The `globalThis` global property gives access to the global object regardless of the current environment.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
foo = 1;               
console.log(foo);

function MyObj() { 
  this.foo = 1;  
} 

MyObj.func1 = function() { 
  if (this.foo == 1) {
    // ... 
  } 
}

\[~ann.campbell.2] Indeed it does not work, JavaScript is tricky:

----
MyObj.func1 = function() {
  if (this.foo == 1) {  // Noncompliant; addresses window.foo => actually it does not it addresses MyObj.foo variable.
    // ...
  }
}

Re-assigned to you: I'll let you update the code snippet in case you have precise ideas about what to put.

Thank you !
