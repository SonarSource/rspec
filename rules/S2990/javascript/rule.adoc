== Why is this an issue?

When the keyword ``++this++`` is used outside of an object, it refers to the global ``++this++`` object, which is the same thing as the ``++window++`` object in a standard web page. Such uses could be confusing to maintainers. Instead, simply drop the ``++this++``, or replace it with ``++window++``; it will have the same effect and be more readable.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
this.foo = 1;   // Noncompliant
console.log(this.foo); // Noncompliant

function MyObj() { 
  this.foo = 1; // Compliant 
} 

MyObj.func1 = function() { 
  if (this.foo == 1) { // Compliant
    // ... 
  } 
} 
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
foo = 1;               
console.log(foo);

function MyObj() { 
  this.foo = 1;  
} 

MyObj.func1 = function() { 
  if (this.foo == 1) {
    // ... 
  } 
}

\[~ann.campbell.2] Indeed it does not work, JavaScript is tricky:

----
MyObj.func1 = function() {
  if (this.foo == 1) {  // Noncompliant; addresses window.foo => actually it does not it addresses MyObj.foo variable.
    // ...
  }
}

Re-assigned to you: I'll let you update the code snippet in case you have precise ideas about what to put.

Thank you !
