An XSD that grows too much  tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain, and having a lot of elements (``++xs:schema++``, ``++xs:import++``, ``++xs:element++``, ``++xs:simpleType++``, ``++xs:complexType++``, ``++xs:sequence++``, ``++xs:choice++``, ``++xs:all++``, ``++xs:extension++``, ``++xs:attribute++``, ``++xs:enumeration++``, ``++xs:complexContent++``, ``++xs:group++``) is an indication that an XSD has grown too large.


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the XSD into smaller ones which focus on well defined topics.
