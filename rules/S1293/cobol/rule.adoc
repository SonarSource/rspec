== Why is this an issue?

OS/VS COBOL accepted the ``++NOTE++`` statement, but IBM Enterprise COBOL does not. Therefore all ``++NOTE++`` statements should be replaced by standard comment lines.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. foo.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
      * Non-Compliant
         NOTE This is a comment.

      * This is a compliant comment.
       END PROGRAM foo.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cobol]
----
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. foo.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
      * Compliant
      * This is a comment.
       END PROGRAM foo.
----
