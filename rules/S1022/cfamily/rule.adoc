== Why is this an issue?

If a compiler implementation detects that a call to a copy constructor is redundant, then it is permitted to omit that call, even if the copy constructor has a side effect other than the construction of a copy of the object. This is called "copy elision".

It is therefore important to ensure that a copy constructor does not modify the program state, since the number of such modifications may be indeterminate.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class A
{
public:
  A ( A const & rhs )
  : m_i ( rhs.m_i )
  {
    ++m_static; // Non-compliant, might not be executed
  }
private:
  int32_t m_i;
  static int32_t m_static;
};
