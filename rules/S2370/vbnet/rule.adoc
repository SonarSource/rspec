== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all non-private ``++Shared ReadOnly++`` fields names match a provided regular expression.


The default configuration is:

* Pascal casing, starting with an upper case character, e.g. BackColor
* Short abbreviations of 2 letters can be capitalized, e.g. GetID
* Longer abbreviations need to be lower cased, e.g. GetHtml


=== Noncompliant code example

With the default regular expression ``++^([A-Z]{1,3}[a-z0-9]+)*([A-Z]{2})?$++``:

[source,vbnet]
----
Class Foo
    Public Shared ReadOnly foo As Integer  ' Noncompliant
End Class
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Class Foo
    Public Shared ReadOnly Foo As Integer  ' Compliant
End Class
----
