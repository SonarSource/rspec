== Why is this an issue?

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable[IDisposable] is an interface implemented by all types which need to provide a mechanism for https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged[releasing unmanaged resources].

Unlike managed memory, which is taken care of by the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals[garbage collection], 

The interface declares a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable.dispose[Dispose] method, which the implementer has to define.

The method name `Dispose` should be used exclusively to implement `IDisposable.Dispose` to prevent any confusion.

It may be tempting to create a `Dispose` method for other purposes, but doing so will result in confusion and likely lead to problems in production.

== How to fix it

First, it is important to determine whether instances of the type defining the `Dispose` method should support the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable[IDisposable] interface or not.

The decision would be based on whether the instance can have unmanaged resources which have to be dealt with, upon destruction or ealier in the lifetime of the object.

The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/dispose-pattern[Dispose pattern] can help making the determination.

If the type should not support the pattern, the `Dispose` method should be renamed to something which is different than `Dispose`, but still relevant and possibly more specific to the context. 

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class GarbageDisposal 
{
  private int Dispose()  // Noncompliant
  {
    // ...
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class GarbageDisposal : IDisposable
{
  public void Dispose() 
  {
    // ...
  }
}
----
or

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class GarbageDisposal 
{
  private int Grind()
  {
    // ...
  }
}
----


=== Exceptions

Methods named `Dispose` and invoked from the `IDisposable.Dispose` implementation are not reported.

[source,csharp]
----
public class GarbageDisposal : IDisposable
{
  protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
  {
    //...
  }
  public void Dispose() 
  {
    Dispose(true);
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
  }
}
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes, it seems to me too that it is doing more. I'm not sure if we would want to add more disposable rules, or cover all the cases of this FxCop rule in this RSPEC.
