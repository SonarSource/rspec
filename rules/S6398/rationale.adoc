JSON injections occur when an application builds a JSON-formatted string from
user input without prior validation or sanitation. In such a case, a tainted 
user-controlled value can tamper with the JSON string content. Especially,
unexpected arbitrary elements can be inserted in the corresponding JSON object.
Those modifications can include:

* Adding additional keys to a JSON dictionary.
* Changing values types.
* Adding elements in an array.

A malicious user-supplied value can perform other modifications depending on
where and how the constructed data is later used.
