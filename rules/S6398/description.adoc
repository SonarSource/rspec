User-provided data, such as URL parameters, POST data payloads, or cookies, are tainted with user-controlled inputs. Therefore, they should always be considered untrusted.	

JSON injection occurs when user-controlled input is embedded into JSON syntax.

In such a scenario, an attacker can alter the semantics of the underlying JSON object and insert additional properties, modify existing properties or change the JSON object in some other way that potentially affects the business logic of the program processing that JSON object.

An attacker may exploit such a vulnerability in a variety of ways, depending on the business logic. In the worst case, it may even be possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
