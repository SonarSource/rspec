In most cases, it is discouraged to build JSON strings with a direct
concatenation of user input. While not always possible, a strong pattern-based
validation can help sanitize tainted inputs. Likewise, converting to a harmless
type can sometimes be a solution.

However, avoiding handling objects' properties as strings by directly
constructing Java objects should be the preferred way.
