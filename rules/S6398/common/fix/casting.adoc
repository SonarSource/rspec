==== Converting to a harmless type

When the application allows it, converting user-submitted data to a harmless
type can help prevent JSON injection vulnerabilities. In particular, converting
user inputs to numeric types is an efficient sanitation mechanism.

This mechanism can be extended to other types, including more complex ones.
However, care should be taken when dealing with them, as manually validating or
sanitizing complex types can represent a challenge.

Note that choosing this solution can be error-prone: every user input
has to be validated or sanitized without oversight.
