This rule raises the issue of calls `strlen(ptr + 1)`, for which the intent is unclear.

== Why is this an issue?

The call `strlen(ptr) + 1` is commonly used to compute the memory required to copy a string:
the one is needed to allocate space for a null-terminator.

The very similar call `strlen(ptr + 1)` that differs by placement of the right parenthesis,
produces vastly different results:

 * non-empty string computes the length of string without the first character (reduced by one)
 * if the string is empty, traverse memory after it until the null terminator (`'\0'`) is found.

The latter may lead to undefined behavior.

Due above, the `strlen(ptr + 1)` calls are likely to be unintended
and result from the type. This rule raises issues on such calls.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c]
----
size_t size = strlen(ptr + 1); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

If the use of `strlen(ptr + 1)` was an typo:

[source,c]
----
size_t size = strlen(ptr) + 1; // Compliant
----

In case when the `strlen(ptr + 1)` was intentional, to preserve the same behavior, you may increment the pointer before the call.

[source,c]
----
char const* next = ptr + 1;
size_t size = strlen(next); // Compliant
----

This will convey the intent more clearly and avoid any uncertainty regarding the intent.

=== What is the potential impact?

If `strlen(ptr + 1)` is accidentally used instead of `strlen(ptr) + 1`, it may have a wide range of effects.
For example, it can lead to buffer overflow if the operation was used to compute the required memory:

[source,c]
----
char* duplicate(char const* source) {
  char result = (char*)malloc(strlen(source + 1)); // Should be malloc(strlen(source) + 1))
  strcpy(result, source);  // Writes two characters outside of "result" buffer
  return result;
}
----

Buffer overflow, as other undefined behavior, has a wide range of effects.
In many cases, the access works by accident and succeeds at writing or reading a value.
However, it can start misbehaving at any time.
If compilation flags, compiler, platform, or runtime environment change,
the same code can crash the application, corrupt memory, or leak a secret.

=== Going extra mile.

{cpp} offers `std::string`, `std::string_view` and many other functions simplifying operating on strings.
When possible, higher-level features should be preferred over C-string APIs.
