== Why is this an issue?

Shared coding conventions make it possible for a team to collaborate efficiently.
This rule raises issues for failures to comply with formatting standard.

By default, this rule conforms to the PER (PHP Evolving Recommendation) standard.

== How to fix it

Fix the issue related to conforming to formatting standards.
