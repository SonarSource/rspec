Shared coding conventions make it possible for a team to collaborate efficiently. This rule raises issues for failures to comply with formatting standard. The default parameter values conform to the PSR2 standard.


== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default PSR2 parameter values:

----
use FooClass;              // Noncompliant; the "use" declaration should be placed after the "namespace" declaration

namespace Vendor\Package;
use FooClass;              // Noncompliant; the "namespace" declaration should be followed by a blank line 
$foo = 1;                  // Noncompliant; the "use" declaration should be followed by a blank line 

class ClassA {             // Noncompliant; an open curly brace should be at the beginning of a new line for classes and functions 
  function my_function(){  // Noncompliant; curly brace on wrong line
    if ($firstThing)       // Noncompliant; an open curly brace should be at the end of line for a control structure
    {
      ...
    }

    if ($secondThing)    { // Noncompliant; there should be exactly one space between the closing parenthesis and the opening curly brace
      ...
    }

    if($thirdThing) {      // Noncompliant; there should be exactly one space between the control structure keyword and the opening parenthesis
      ...
    }
    else {                 // Noncompliant; the close curly brace and the next "else" (or "catch" or "finally") keyword should be located on the same line
      ...
    }

    try{                   // Noncompliant; there should be exactly one space between the control structure keyword and the curly brace
      ...
    } catch (Exception $e) {
    }

    analyse( $fruit ) ;    // Noncompliant; there should not be any space after the opening parenthesis and before the closing parenthesis

    for ($i = 0;$i < 10;   $i++) { // Nomcompliant; there should be exactly one space after each ";" in the {{for}} statement 
      ...
    }

    pressJuice($apply ,$orange);    // Noncompliant; the comma should be followed by one space and not preceded by any 

    do_something ();       // Noncompliant; there should not be any space after the method name

    foreach ($fruits    as $fruit_key =>     $fruit) {  // Noncompliant; in the foreach statement there should be one space before and after "as" keyword and "=>" operator
      ...
    }
  }
}

class ClassB
extends ParentClass  // Noncompliant; the class name and the "extends" / "implements" keyword should be on the same line
{
  ...
}

class ClassC extends ParentClass implements \ArrayAccess, \Countable,
    \Serializable    // Noncompliant; the list of implemented interfaces should be correctly indented
{

  public function aVeryLongMethodName(ClassTypeHint $arg1, // Noncompliant; the arguments in a method declaration should be correctly indented
    &$arg2, array $arg3 = []) {

    $noArgs_longVars = function () use ($longVar1,         // Noncompliant; the arguments in a function declaration should be correctly indented
        $longerVar2,
        $muchLongerVar3
    ) {
      ...
    };

    $foo->bar($longArgument,    // Noncompliant; the arguments in a method call should be correctly indented
      $longerArgument,
      $muchLongerArgument);     // Noncompliant; the closing parenthesis should be placed on the next line

    $closureWithArgsAndVars = function($arg1, $arg2)use   ($var1, $var2) {  // Noncompliant; the closure declaration should be correctly spaced - see (5)
      ...
    };
  }
}

== Compliant Solution

    if ($firstThing) {    // Compliant; the open curly brace is at the end of line for the control structure

    }
