Validation is the first line of defense against injection, cross-site scripting, and many other attacks. Omitting it in modern web applications is simply negligent.


When creating a Struts ``++ActionForm++``, you have the choice of extending something from the ``++org.apache.struts.action++`` package, or extending something from the ``++org.apache.struts.validator++`` package. Since you can't use the Struts validator capabilities without extending something from the ``++validator++`` package, that should always be your choice. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyForm extends org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm {  // Noncompliant
  // ...
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public class MyForm extends org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorForm {
  // ...
----
