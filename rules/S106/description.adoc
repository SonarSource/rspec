In software development, logs serve as a record of events within an application, providing crucial insights for debugging.
When logging, it is essential to ensure that the logs are:

* easily accessible
* uniformly formatted for readability
* properly recorded
* securely logged when dealing with sensitive data

If a program directly writes to the standard outputs (i.e. {language_std_outputs}) those requirements are not met.
That's why defining and using a dedicated logger is highly recommended.
