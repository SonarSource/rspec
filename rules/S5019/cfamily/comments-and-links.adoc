\[~loic.joly] please double-check "this" RSpec against RSPEC-3608. Without closely reading both I think there may be overlap if not duplication.

\[~ann.campbell.2] There is overlap, but I believe that RSPEC-3608 is much too strict (even if something similar could appear in the next Misra standard), and I would clearly not enable it in one of my codebases, while I would enable this one.

I'm also thinking one another related rule, which would be something like "Lambdas that outlive their definition scope should not implicitely capture by reference". If I can have this one, I will probably remove RSPEC-3608 from SonarWay.
