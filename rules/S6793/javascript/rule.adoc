== Why is this an issue?

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used to enhance the accessibility of web content and web applications. These attributes provide additional information about an element's role, state, properties, and values to assistive technologies like screen readers.

This rule checks that the values of ARIA attributes in DOM elements are valid.

== How to fix it in JSX

Check that each element with a defined ARIA attribute has a valid value.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<span aria-hidden="ok">foo</span>
----

To fix the code use a valid value for the aria-* attribute.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<span aria-hidden="true">foo</span>
----
