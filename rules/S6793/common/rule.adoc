== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/jsts/aria-intro-1.adoc[]

This rule checks that the values of ARIA attributes "aria-*" in DOM elements are valid.

== How to fix it

Check that each element with a defined ARIA attribute has a valid value.

[source,html,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<span aria-hidden="ok">foo</span>
----

To fix the code use a valid value for the aria-* attribute.

[source,html,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<span aria-hidden="true">foo</span>
----
