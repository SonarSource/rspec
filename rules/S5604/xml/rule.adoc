Permissions that can have a large impact on user privacy, marked as https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission[dangerous or "not for use by third-party applications" by Android], should be requested only if they are really necessary to implement critical features of an application.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* It is not sure that ``++dangerous++`` permissions requested by the application are https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/usage-notes#avoid_requesting_unnecessary_permissions[really necessary].
* The users are not https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/usage-notes#be_transparent[clearly informed] why and when dangerous permissions are requested by the application.

You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to carefully review all the permissions and to use ``++dangerous++`` ones only if they are really necessary.

== Sensitive Code Example

In AndroidManifest.xml:

----
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /> <!-- Sensitive --> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION" /> <!-- Sensitive --> 
----

== Compliant Solution

----
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /> <!-- Compliant --> 
----
