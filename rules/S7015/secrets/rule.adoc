=== What is the potential impact?

// Optional: Give a general description of the secret and what it's used for.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

// Set value that can be used to refer to the type of secret in, for example:
// "An attacker can use this {secret_type} to ..."
:secret_type: secret key



// Where possible, use predefined content for common impacts. This content can
// be found in the folder "shared_content/secrets/impact".
// When using predefined content, search for any required variables to be set and include them in this file.
// Not adding them will not trigger warnings.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("digitalocean-access-key", "DO00XKV5BH8TGTFZA9WE");
props.set("digitalocean-secret-key", "012x066q5mcVcJtQELV2jKo10ke8UkfPMARCXX2JwnE"); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("digitalocean-access-key", System.getenv("DO_ACCESS_KEY"));
props.set("digitalocean-secret-key", System.getenv("DO_SECRET_KEY"));
