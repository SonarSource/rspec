== Why is this an issue?

In Java 8 ``++Streams++`` were introduced to support chaining of operations over collections in a functional style. The most common way to save a result of such chains is to save them to some collection (usually ``++List++``). To do so there is a terminal method ``++collect++`` that can be used with a library of ``++Collectors++``. The key problem is that ``++.collect(Collectors.toList())++`` actually returns a mutable kind of ``++List++`` while in the majority of cases unmodifiable lists are preferred. In Java 10 a new collector appeared to return an unmodifiable list:  ``++toUnmodifiableList()++``. This does the trick but results in verbose code. Since Java 16 there is now a better variant to produce an unmodifiable list directly from a stream: ``++Stream.toList()++``.


This rule raises an issue when "collect" is used to create a list from a stream.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
List<String> list1 = Stream.of("A", "B", "C")
                           .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Noncompliant

List<String> list2 = Stream.of("A", "B", "C")
                           .collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList()); // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
List<String> list1 = Stream.of("A", "B", "C").toList(); // Compliant

List<String> list2 = Stream.of("A", "B", "C")
                           .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Compliant, the list2 needs to be mutable

list2.add("X");
