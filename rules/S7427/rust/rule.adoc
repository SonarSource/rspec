== Why is this an issue?

Transmuting a null pointer is undefined behavior and can lead to unpredictable program crashes and security vulnerabilities.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,rust,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let null_ref: &u64 = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(0 as *const u64) }; // Noncompliant: Transmuting a null pointer.
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,rust,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let null_ref: Option<&u64> = None; // Compliant: Use Option to represent nullable references.
