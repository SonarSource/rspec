The purpose of the ``++Thread.run()++`` method is to execute code in a separate, dedicated thread. Calling this method directly doesn't make sense because it causes its code to be executed in the current thread. 


To get the expected behavior, call the ``++Thread.start()++`` method instead.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Thread myThread = new Thread(runnable);
myThread.run(); // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Thread myThread = new Thread(runnable);
myThread.start(); // Compliant
----
