An LDAP client authenticates to an LDAP server with a "bind request" which provides, among other, a https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Simple%20Authentication[simple authentication method].
Simple authentication in LDAP can be used with three different mechanisms:

* _Anonymous Authentication Mechanism_ by performing a bind request with a username and password value of zero length.
* _Unauthenticated Authentication Mechanism_ by performing a bind request with a password value of zero length.
* _Name/Password Authentication Mechanism_ by performing a bind request with a password value of non-zero length.

Anonymous binds and unauthenticated binds allow access to information in the LDAP directory without providing a password, their use is therefore strongly discouraged.
