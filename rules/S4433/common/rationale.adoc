Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers provide two main
authentication methods: the _SASL_ and _Simple_ ones. The 
_Simple Authentication_ method also breaks down into three different mechanisms:

* _Anonymous_ Authentication
* _Unauthenticated_ Authentication
* _Name/Password_ Authentication

A server that accepts either the _Anonymous_ or _Unauthenticated_ mechanisms will
accept connections from clients not providing credentials.
