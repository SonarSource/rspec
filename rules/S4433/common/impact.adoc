An attacker exploiting unauthenticated access to an LDAP server can access the
data that is stored in the corresponding directory. The impact varies depending
on the permission obtained on the directory and the type of data it stores.

==== Authentication bypass

If attackers get write access to the directory, they will be able to alter
most of the data it stores. This might include sensitive technical data such as
user passwords or asset configurations. Such an attack can typically lead to
an authentication bypass on applications and systems that use the affected
directory as an identity provider.

In such a case, all users configured in the directory might see their identity
and privileges taken over.

==== Sensitive information leak

If attackers get read-only access to the directory, they will be able to read
the data it stores. That data might include security-sensitive pieces of
information.

Typically, attackers might get access to user account lists that they can use
in further intrusion steps. For example, they could use such lists to perform
password spraying, or related attacks, on all systems that rely on the affected
directory as an identity provider.

If the directory contains some Personally Identifiable Information, an attacker
accessing it might represent a violation of regulatory requirements in some
countries. For example, this kind of security event would go against the
European GDPR law.
