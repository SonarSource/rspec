This rule targets an old version of JUnit (version 3, JUnit 4 has been released more than 10 years ago) and the current implementation behaves poorly in detecting potential ``++suite++`` methods, raising false positives, even on old code.


We do not feel that fixing the current implementation is worth the added value of this rule, we therefore decided to deprecate it.


In addition, we implementedÂ RSPEC-5826 to target a similar problem in newer versions of JUnit.
