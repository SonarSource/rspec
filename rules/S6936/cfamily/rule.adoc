== Why is this an issue?

Defining or declaring identifiers with the same names as macros and functions from the C standard library is likely to lead to unexpected results.
// macros, classes, variables or functions/methods

Such identifiers have the potential to thoroughly confuse people who are unfamiliar with the code base, possibly leading them to introduce additional errors. Therefore, the names of C standard library macros and functions should not be used as identifiers.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#define INT_MAX 1000  // Noncompliant: INT_MAX is a C standard macro

namespace exit {  // Noncompliant: exit is a C standard function
  using signal = bool;  // Noncompliant: signal is a C standard function

  struct div { // Noncompliant: div is a C standard function
    signal abs;  // Noncompliant: abs is a C standard function
  };

  enum class time { // Noncompliant: time is a C standard function
    localtime,  // Noncompliant: localtime is a C standard function
    remotetime
  };

  int free(void *pArg, int len) {  // Noncompliant: free is a C standard function
    //...
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
#define MY_INT_MAX 1000

namespace my_exit {
  using flag = bool;

  struct divider {
    flag absolute;
  };

  enum class timekind {
    local_time,
    remote_time
  };

  int clean(void *pArg, int len) {
    //...
  }
}
