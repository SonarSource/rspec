== Why is this an issue?

Defining or declaring identifiers with the same names as well-known macros and functions from the C standard library has the potential to thoroughly confuse people who are unfamiliar with the code base, possibly leading them to introduce additional errors. Therefore, the names of well-known C standard library macros and functions should not be used as identifiers.

== How to fix it

Rename the identifier to a name that does not correspond to a well-known macro or function name in the C standard library.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#define INT_MAX 1000  // Noncompliant: INT_MAX is a C standard macro

namespace exit {  // Noncompliant: exit is a C standard function
  using signal = bool;  // Noncompliant: signal is a C standard function

  struct div { // Noncompliant: div is a C standard function
    signal abs;  // Noncompliant: abs is a C standard function
  };

  int free(void *pArg, int len) {  // Noncompliant: free is a C standard function
    //...
  }
}
