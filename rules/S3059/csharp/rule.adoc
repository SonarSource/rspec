There's no point in having a ``++public++`` member in a non-``++public++`` type because objects that can't access the type will never have the chance to access the member.


This rule raises an issue when a type has methods, fields, or inner typs with higher visibility than the type itself has.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
internal class MyClass
{
    public static decimal PI = 3.14m;  // Noncompliant

    public int GetOne() // Noncompliant
    {
        return 1;
    }

    protected record NestedType // Noncompliant: outer class is internal
    {
        public bool FlipCoin() // Noncompliant: parent class is protected
        {
            return false;
        }
        // ...
    }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
internal class MyClass // Class visibility upgrade makes members compliant
{
    public static decimal PI = 3.14m;

    public int GetOne()
    {
        return 1;
    }

    protected record NestedType
    {
        protected bool FlipCoin() // visibility changed to match class
        {
            return false;
        }
        // ...
    }
}
