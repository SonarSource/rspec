An inheritance list entry is redundant if:

* It is ``++Object++`` - all classes extend ``++Object++`` implicitly.
* It is ``++int++`` for an ``++enum++``
* It is a base class of another listed inheritance.

Such redundant declarations should be removed because they needlessly clutter the code and can be confusing.

== Noncompliant Code Example

public class MyClass : Object  // Noncompliant

enum MyEnum : int  // Noncompliant
