An inheritance list entry is redundant if:

* It is `+Object+` - all classes extend `+Object+` implicitly.
* It is `+int+` for an `+enum+`
* It is a base class of another listed inheritance.

Such redundant declarations should be removed because they needlessly clutter the code and can be confusing.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyClass : Object  // Noncompliant

enum MyEnum : int  // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public class MyClass

enum MyEnum
----
