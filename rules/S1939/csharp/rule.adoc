== Why is this an issue?

An inheritance list entry is redundant if:

* It is ``++Object++`` - all classes extend ``++Object++`` implicitly.
* It is ``++int++`` for an ``++enum++``
* It is a base class of another listed inheritance.

Such redundant declarations should be removed because they needlessly clutter the code and can be confusing.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class MyClass : Object  // Noncompliant

enum MyEnum : int  // Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public class MyClass

enum MyEnum
----
