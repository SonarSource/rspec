All classes extend ``++Object++`` implicitly. Doing so explicitly is redundant.


Further, declaring the implementation of an interface _and_ one if its parents is also redundant. If you implement the interface, you also implicitly implement its parents and there's no need to do so explicitly.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public interface MyFace {
  // ...
}

public interface MyOtherFace extends MyFace {
  // ...
}

public class Foo 
    extends Object // Noncompliant
    implements MyFace, MyOtherFace {  // Noncompliant
  //...
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public interface MyFace {
  // ...
}

public interface MyOtherFace extends MyFace {
  // ...
}

public class Foo implements MyOtherFace {
  //...
}
----
