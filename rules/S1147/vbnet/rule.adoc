``++End++`` statements exit the control flow of the program in an unstructured way. This statement stops code execution immediately without executing ``++Dispose++`` or ``++Finalize++`` methods, or executing ``++Finally++`` blocks. Therefore, it should be avoided.

== Noncompliant Code Example

Module Module1
    Sub Print(ByVal str As String)
       Try
            ...
            End       ' Noncompliant
        Finally
            ' do something important here
            ...
        End Try
    End Sub
End Module
