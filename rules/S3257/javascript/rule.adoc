== Why is this an issue?

TypeScript has a feature called "type inference" which allows it to automatically infer the type of a variable based on its initial value. This means that if you initialize a variable with a certain type of value, TypeScript will assume that this variable should always hold that type of value.

Unnecessarily verbose declarations and initializations make it harder to read the code and should be simplified. Specifically, primitive (``++number++``, ``++string++``, ``++boolean++`` and others) types should be omitted from variable and parameter declaration when they can be easily inferred from the initialized or defaulted value.

== How to fix it

When the type can be easily inferred from the context, omit the type declaration to make the code more concise and readable.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const n: number = 1; // Noncompliant, "number" can be omitted

function foo(s: string = "") {} // Noncompliant, "string" can be omitted

class Bar {
  b: boolean = true;  // Noncompliant, "boolean" can be omitted
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const n = 1;

function foo(s = "") {}

class Bar {
  b = true;
}
----
