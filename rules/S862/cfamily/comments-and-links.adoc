This one cannot be implemented as a regular issue.


We could raise an issue on the project's level as soon as we detect some arithmetic using floating point exceptions, but probably not much more.

This is a MISRA rule, and the point of the MISRA rule is not to track all operations that use floating point operation. It means that, as soon as there is one floating point operation, and only once, there should be a document, probably external to the source code, that specifies :

____
this rule requires that documentation be produced to demonstrate that all the issues have been covered by the implementation.

This is not the kind of document than can be handled by comments in the justifications.


If instead of following MISRA, you would like to define a SonarSource rule to track all usage of floating point, then of course it would be possible, I just don't see what could be the value of such a rule...
