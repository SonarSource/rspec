== Why is this an issue?

The safe use of floating-point arithmetic requires a high level of numerical analysis skills and in-depth knowledge of the compiler and target hardware.


If floating-point is to be used, then the following issues need to be covered as part of the deviation process:

* A justification explaining why floating-point is the appropriate or only solution.
* Demonstrate that appropriate skills are available.
* Demonstrate that an appropriate process is being applied.
* Document the floating-point implementation.

The paper “What Every Computer Scientist Should Know about Floating-Point Arithmetic” explains the issues that need to be considered when using floating-point.


For example, when solving a quadratic equation, the value of b^2^-4.a.c is calculated. Assume that a=1.22, b=3.34, c=2.28 and that three significant digits are used during calculation. The exact value of b^2^–4.a.c is 0.0292. However, b^2^ rounds to 11.2 and 4.a.c rounds to 11.1, giving a final answer of 0.1. This example demonstrates _catastrophic cancellation_. The subtraction does not cause an error, but it does expose errors introduced in the multiplications that are used when generating its operands.
