Constructing templates by dynamically inserting strings coming from third-party
sources is an anti-pattern which creates code that is brittle, difficult to
read, and challenging to debug.

Moreover, in the long run, this practice progressively increases the likelihood
of introducing **Server-Side Template Injections (SSTI)**, sometimes in complex
ways that are hard to detect.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The third-party strings are fully trusted and controlled by you.
* You have a secure mechanism to validate or sanitize the strings inserted into templates.

There is a risk if you answered no to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to standardize on safe template-building practices. +
Separate logic from presentation by passing dynamic data to templates through
a secure context or data-binding mechanism, rather than building the template
string itself.
