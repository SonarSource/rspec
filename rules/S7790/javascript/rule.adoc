Building and executing templates that are based on a variety of different
dynamic sources can be difficult to maintain, debug and can increase the risk of
template injection when concatenating untrusted values into the query.

It also creates a precedent of poor practice which in turn increase the risk of template injection in other parts of the codebase.


This rule aims to help developers clean up and standardize the way they build and execute templates.

By correcting this issue, you might even solve nth-order injections in the codebase which might have been overlooked with regular static analysis.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* You trust the author of this third-party action or workflow
* You accept that this third-party action or workflow could change at any time

There is a risk if you answered no to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to use the complete commit hash to pin the version when using third-party actions and workflows.
This is the only way to ensure that the code you are pulling into your action is the one you have reviewed.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: docs/example-action@main  # Sensitive
----

== Compliant Solution

Use the full commit hash as a reference to pin the version.

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: docs/example-action@b16d2601a6b948e2fb26f3772276581f31daa7cd
