=== Remote Code Execution

:link-with-uscores1: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.codedom.compiler.tempfilecollection.-ctor?view=netframework-4.8#System_CodeDom_Compiler_TempFileCollection__ctor

When an application deserializes untrusted data without proper restrictions, an attacker can craft malicious serialized objects that contain executable code. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially gaining full control over the system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even complete system compromise.

For example, a well-known attack vector consists in serializing an object of type ``{link-with-uscores1}[TempFileCollection]`` with arbitrary files (defined by an attacker) which will be deleted on the application deserializing this object (when the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.codedom.compiler.tempfilecollection.finalize?view=netframework-4.8[finalize()] method of the TempFileCollection object is called). This kind of types are called "https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net[gadgets]".

=== Elevation of Privilege

Unrestricted deserialization can also enable an attacker to escalate their privileges within the application. By manipulating the serialized data, an attacker can modify object properties or bypass security checks, granting themselves elevated privileges that they should not have. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized actions, or even administrative control over the application.

=== Denial of Service

In certain cases, an attacker can abuse the deserialization process to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. By providing specially crafted serialized data, the attacker can trigger excessive resource consumption, leading to system instability or unresponsiveness. This can disrupt the availability of the application, impacting its functionality and causing inconvenience to users.
