Instead of using {BinaryFormatter}[``BinaryFormatter``] and similar serializers, it is recommended to use safer alternatives in most of the cases, such as {XmlSerializer}[``XmlSerializer``] or {DataContractSerializer}[``DataContractSerializer``]. 

If it's not possible then try to mitigate the risk by restricting the types allowed to be deserialized:

* by implementing an "allow-list" of types, but keep in mind that novel dangerous types are regularly discovered and this protection could be insufficient over time.

* or/and implementing a tamper protection, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[message authentication codes] (MAC). This way only objects serialized with the correct MAC hash will be deserialized.
