Both the "\+" operator and the "&" operator can be used to concatenate strings. However, there is a complicated set of rules around the actual  behavior of the "+" operator, and whether you will get a concatenation operation, addition, a compiler error, or a `+Type mismatch+` error. On the other hand, the "&" operator can only perform concatenation, and is therefore preferred.
