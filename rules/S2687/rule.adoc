There are no constants in Python, but when a variable is named with all uppercase letters, the convention is to treat it as a constant. I.e. to use it as a read-only variable, and not reassign its value.


Ignore this convention, and you run the risk of confusing other developers, particularly those with experience in other languages. This rule raises an issue each time a variable named with all uppercase letters is reassigned.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
RESOURCE_NAME = 'foo'
# ...
RESOURCE_NAME = 'bar'  # Noncompliant
