== Why is this an issue?

_Mutexes_ are synchronization primitives that allow the managing of concurrency. It is a common situation to have to use multiple _mutexes_ to protect multiple resources with different access patterns.


In such a situation, it is crucial to define an order on the set of all _mutexes_:

* This order should be strictly followed when _locking_ _mutexes_.
* The reverse order should be strictly followed when _unlocking_ _mutexes_.


Failure to do so can lead to _deadlocks_. i.e., situations where two or more threads are blocked forever, each holding one mutex and waiting for one held by the other(s).


In {cpp}, an easy way to make sure the unlocks are called in reverse order from the lock is to wrap the lock/unlock operations in an RAII class (since destructors of local variables are called in reverse order of their creation).


If instead of ``++pthread_mutex_t++`` you are using ``++std::mutex++``, there are other mechanisms that allow you to avoid deadlocks in that case, see S5524.

== How to fix it

Reorder locking and unlocking operations to always lock in the same order and unlock in the reverse order.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c]
----
pthread_mutex_t mtx1;
pthread_mutex_t mtx2;

void thread_safe_operation(void) {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx1);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx2);
  use_resources();
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx1); // Noncompliant
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx2);
}
----


==== Compliant solution

C solution:

[source,c]
----
pthread_mutex_t mtx1;
pthread_mutex_t mtx2;

void thread_safe_operation(void) {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx1);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx2);
  use_resources();
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx2);
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx1);
}
----

{cpp}03 solution:

[source,cpp]
----
pthread_mutex_t mtx1;
pthread_mutex_t mtx2;

struct MutexLocker {
  MutexLocker(pthread_mutex_t* mtx) : mtx(mtx) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mtx);
  }
  ~MutexLocker() {
    pthread_mutex_unlock(mtx);
  }
  pthread_mutex_t* mtx;
};

struct ResourcesLocker {
  ResourcesLocker() : m1(&mtx1), m2(&mtx2) {}
  MutexLocker m1;
  MutexLocker m2;
};

void thread_safe_operation(void) {
  ResourcesLocker locker;
  use_resources();
}
----

{cpp}11 and {cpp}14 solution:

[source,cpp]
----
std::mutex m1;
std::mutex m2;

void thread_safe_operation(void) {
  std::lock(m1, m2);
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lck1(m1, std::adopt_lock);
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lck2(m2, std::adopt_lock);
  use_resources();
}
----

{cpp}17 and after:

[source,cpp]
----
std::mutex m1;
std::mutex m2;

void thread_safe_operation(void) {
  std::scoped_lock<std::mutex, std::mutex> lck1(m1, m2);
  use_resources();
}
