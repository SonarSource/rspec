Having long `RUN` instruction on a single line reduce the visibility and make it harder to read and understand.

== Why is this an issue?

In Dockerfiles, `RUN` instruction tend to be extensive and can rapidly become quite long, containing a lot of instruction with parameters and flags. +
In order to keep a good readability and help for future maintenance, it is important to split them into multiple lines. +
It is usually a good idea to group elements that belong together on the same lines. +
The usage of the operator `&&` allows to chain multiple operators. Also, the default operator `\` allows to continue the `RUN` instruction on the next line. +
Another way is to use the here documents format, which allows to define multiple instructions together without any chaining operator.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-bar package-baz package-foo package-eel
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
# Split shell form
RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y \
  package-bar \
  package-baz \
  package-foo \
  package-eel


# Heredoc form
RUN <<EOF
apt-get update
apt-get install -y \
    package-bar \
    package-baz \
    package-foo \
    package-eel
EOF
