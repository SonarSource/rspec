== Why is this an issue?

When creating a custom Markup Extension that accepts parameters in WPF, the ``++ConstructorArgument++`` markup must be used to identify the discrete properties that match these parameters. However since this is done via a string, the compiler will not notice if there are typos.


This rule raises an issue when the string argument to ``++ConstructorArgumentAttribute++`` doesn't match any parameter of any constructor.
