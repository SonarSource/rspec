== Why is this an issue?

The values that can be represented by a signed bit field with a length of one bit may not meet developer expectations. For example according to the C99 Standard, Section 6.2.6.2, a single-bit signed bit-field has a single (one) sign bit and no (zero) value bits.


This rule does not apply to unnamed bit fields, as their values cannot be accessed.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
signed int f:1;  // Noncompliant; there's only room here for the sign
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
unsigned int f:1;
----
or

[source,cpp]
----
signed int:1; // unnamed
----
or

[source,cpp]
----
signed int f:2;
----

Sorry [~evgeny.mandrikov], I didn't notice the lack of SQALE &etc. I'll pay more attention next time.
