== Why is this an issue?

React `isMounted()` is primarily used to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has unmounted, because calling `setState()` after a component has unmounted will emit a warning. Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning, which is raising awareness that the app is still holding a reference to the component after the component has been unmounted.

When using ES6 classes, using `isMounted()` is already prohibited.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    mydatastore.subscribe(this);
  }
  dataHandler: function() {
    if (this.isMounted()) { // Noncompliant: isMounted() hides the error
        //...
    }
  }
  render: function() {
    //... calls dataHandler()
  }
});

Find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount`, before the component unmounts.

  componentWillUnmount() {
    mydatastore.unsubscribe(this);
  }
}
