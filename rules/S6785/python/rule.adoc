GraphQL servers are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks when they fail to 
limit the depth of queries. In such a case, an attacker is able to craft complex, 
deeply nested queries to make the application unwillingly consume an important
amount of resources.

== Why is this an issue?

When a server receives a deeply nested query, it attempts to resolve all the
requested data. This process can consume a substantial amount of computational
resources, leading to a slowdown in server response times.

=== What is the potential impact?

A server that faces a resource exhaustion situation can become unstable.
The exact impact will depend on how the affected application is deployed and
how well the hosting server configuration is hardened.

In the worst case, when the application is deployed in an uncontained 
environment, directly on its host system, the memory exhaustion will affect
the whole hosting server. The server’s operating system might start killing
arbitrary memory-intensive processes, including the main application or other
sensitive ones. This will result in a general operating failure, also known 
as a Denial of Service (DoS).

In cases where the application is deployed in a virtualized or otherwise 
contained environment, or where resource usage limits are in place, the 
consequences are limited to the vulnerable application only. In that case,
other processes and applications hosted on the same server may keep on
running without perturbation. The vulnerable application will still
stop working properly.

In general, that kind of DoS attack can have severe financial consequences.
They are particularly important when the affected systems are business-critical.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from graphql_server.flask import GraphQLView

app.add_url_rule("/api",
    view_func=GraphQLView.as_view(  # Noncompliant
        name="api",
        schema=schema,
    )
)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
from graphql_server.flask import GraphQLView
from graphene.validation import depth_limit_validator

app.add_url_rule("/api",
    view_func=GraphQLView.as_view(
        name="api",
        schema=schema,
        validation_rules=[
           depth_limit_validator(10) # Choose a value that fits your application's requirements
        ]
    )
)
----

=== How does this work?

==== Avoid circular references

A prerequisite for deeply nested query to be executed is the presence of
circular references in the database schema. Avoid or minimize 
circular references when designing the application's database schema.

==== Set limits

Limit the depth of the queries your server will accept. By setting a maximum 
depth, you can ensure that excessively nested queries are rejected. Remember,
the values for maximum depth and complexity should be set according to your 
application's specific needs. Setting these limits too low could restrict
legitimate queries, while setting them too high could leave your server 
vulnerable to attacks.

The easiest way to set such a limit is to use the query validation API available from Graphene 3. Applications running Graphene 2 should consider upgrading to Graphene 3 to benefit from this API.
