== Why is this an issue?

Constructor functions, which create new object instances, must only be called with ``++new++``. Non-constructor functions must not. Mixing these two usages could lead to unexpected results at runtime.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function getNum() {
  return 5;
}

function Num(numeric, alphabetic) {
  this.numeric = numeric;
  this.alphabetic = alphabetic;
}

var myFirstNum = getNum();
var my2ndNum = new getNum();  // Noncompliant. An empty object is returned, NOT 5

var myNumObj1 = new Num();
var myNumObj2 = Num();  // Noncompliant. undefined is returned, NOT an object

=== Message

Correct the use of this function; on line n it was called [with|without] "new".


=== Highlighting

* primary: 1st inconsistent function call
* secondary: previous function call with different syntax
** message: Called [with|without] "new"
