== Why is this an issue?

No member function can be invoked on a const-qualified object unless the member function is declared "const".


Qualifying member functions that don't mutate their object with the "const" qualifier makes your interface easier to understand; you can deduce without diving into implementation if a member function is going to mutate its object.


Also, const-qualified member functions make working with const-qualified objects possible. The compiler ensures that only member functions that are declared "const" can be invoked on "const" objects. Avoiding declaring non-mutating member functions const might break const-correctness: it will not be possible to invoke such non-mutating functions on const-qualified objects.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class A {
  void f(){ // Noncompliant
    std::cout<< "f doesn't mutate A";
  }
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class A {
  void f() const {
    std::cout<< "f doesn't mutate A";
  }
};
----


=== Exceptions

Virtual member functions that don't mutate their objects don't necessarily need to be declared const. This might be done in order to allow them to be overridden by non-const functions.
