A bare ``++raise++`` statement, i.e. a ``++raise++`` with no exception provided, will re-raise the last active exception in the current scope. If no exception is active a ``++RuntimeError++`` is raised instead.

If the bare "raise" statement is in a ``++finally++`` block, it will only have an active exception to re-raise when an exception from the ``++try++`` block is not caught or when an exception is raised by an ``++except++`` or ``++else++`` block. Thus bare ``++raise++`` statements should not be relied upon in ``++finally++`` blocks. It is simpler to let the exception raise automatically.


This rule raises an issue when a bare ``++raise++`` statements is in a ``++finally++`` block.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
def foo(param):
    result = 0
    try:
        print("foo")
    except ValueError as e:
        pass
    else:
        if param:
            raise ValueError()
    finally:
        if param:
            raise  # Noncompliant. This will fail in some context.
        else:
            result = 1
    return result
----


== Compliant Solution

----
def foo(param):
    result = 0
    try:
        print("foo")
    except ValueError as e:
        pass
    else:
        if param:
            raise ValueError()
    finally:
        if not param:
            result = 1
        # the exception will raise automatically
    return result
----
