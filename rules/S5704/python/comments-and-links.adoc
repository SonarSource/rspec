This rule is similar to RSPEC-1163 but the problem is a little different. It is perfectly ok to raise an exception in a ``++finally++`` block in python. Python will automatically link the new exception to any exception raised in the ``++try++`` block. However a bare ``++raise++`` is problematic as it can fail.
