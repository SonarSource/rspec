Using compound operators as well as increments and decrements (and toggling, in the case of ``++boolean++``s) on primitive fields are not atomic operations. That is, they don't happen in a single step. For instance, when a ``++volatile++`` primitive field is incremented or decremented you run the risk of data loss if threads interleave in the steps of the update. Instead, use a guaranteed-atomic class such as ``++AtomicInteger++``, or synchronize the access.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
private volatile int count = 0;
private volatile boolean boo = false;

public void incrementCount() {
  count++;  // Noncompliant
}

public void toggleBoo(){
  boo = !boo;  // Noncompliant
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
private AtomicInteger count = 0;
private boolean boo = false;

public void incrementCount() {
  count.incrementAndGet(); 
}

public synchronized void toggleBoo() {
  boo = !boo;
}
----
