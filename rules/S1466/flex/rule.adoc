== Why is this an issue?

The Security.exactSettings value should remain set at the default value of true. Setting this value to false could make the SWF vulnerable to cross-domain attacks.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,flex]
----
Security.exactSettings = false;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,flex]
----
Security.exactSettings = true;
