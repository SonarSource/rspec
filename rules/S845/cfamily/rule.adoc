== Why is this an issue?

Some signed to unsigned conversions may lead to implementation-defined behavior. This behavior may not be consistent with developer expectations.


If you need to mix signed and unsigned types, you should make your intent explicit by using explicit casts and avoiding implicit casts.


This rule will detect implicit conversions that change the signedness.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f(int a) {
  unsigned int b = a; // Noncompliant
  int c = (a > 0) ? a : b; // Noncompliant  

  if (a > b) { // Noncompliant
    // ...
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f(int a) {
  unsigned int b = static_cast<unsigned int>(a); // Compliant
}
----
