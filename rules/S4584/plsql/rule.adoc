``++CREATE_TIMER++`` is generating network traffic each time the timer is fired. It's probably totally fine for a timer being executed every hour but generally, this is used to provide clocks components that are going to generate network traffic every second or more.

It is recommended by Oracle to examine timers and replace them with JavaBeans.

BEGIN
  timer := CREATE_TIMER('foo', 1000, REPEAR)
