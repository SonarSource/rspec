== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, labels are identifiers that allow you to name blocks of code, such as loops and conditional statements. They are used in conjunction with statements like `break` and `continue` to control the flow of execution within nested loops and conditionals.

It's worth noting that labels are not widely used in modern JavaScript programming because they can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. In most cases, there are better alternatives to achieve the desired control flow without resorting to labels.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
myLabel: {
  let x = doSomething();
  if (x > 0) {
    break myLabel;
  }
  doSomethingElse();
}
----

If you find yourself using labels, you should reevaluate your code structure and explore other options for better code clarity and maintainability.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let x = doSomething();
if (x <= 0) {
  doSomethingElse();
}

\[~ann.campbell.2] After SONARJS-953 this rule will not raise issue for any loop. WDYT how this should be in RSPEC? exception?

\[~elena.vilchik] I've added an exception. Since I'm not sure I've ever seen any other use of labels outside of COBOL, will you update the code samples?
