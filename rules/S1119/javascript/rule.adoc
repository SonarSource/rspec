Labels are not commonly used, and many developers do not understand how they work. Moreover, their usage makes the control flow harder to follow, which reduces the code's readability.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
myLabel: {
  let x = doSomething();
  if (x > 0) {
    break myLabel;
  }
  doSomethingElse();
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
let x = doSomething();
if (x <= 0) {
  doSomethingElse();
}
----
