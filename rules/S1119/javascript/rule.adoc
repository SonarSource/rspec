== Why is this an issue?

Labels are not commonly used, and many developers do not understand how they work. Moreover, their usage makes the control flow harder to follow, which reduces the code's readability.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
myLabel: {
  let x = doSomething();
  if (x > 0) {
    break myLabel;
  }
  doSomethingElse();
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
let x = doSomething();
if (x <= 0) {
  doSomethingElse();
}
----
