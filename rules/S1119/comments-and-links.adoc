\[~ann.campbell.2] shouldn't we promote "targeted" languages from RSPEC-3045, which was marked as duplicating this one?

\[~ann.campbell.2] For C#, C, {cpp} and Objective-C we already have RSPEC-907 and for these languages (plus Python) the only way to use labels - is to use "goto", because in contrast with Java, JavaScript, Swift, Groovy and Flex only "goto" statement (not "break" and "continue") can transfer control to a label. From here I'm wondering what we should do with those RSPECs ? Don't know and didn't checked situation in VB.Net, PHP and others.

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] I've adjusted the languages of both rules, but beyond that I'm not sure there's anything to do with either of them...? I suspect you want to see one deprecated or superceded by the other, but for instance Java and Swift don't have ``++goto++`` and you say C-family languages + C# (I just learned) don't have labels without ``++goto++`` so I think this is a case of different rules for different language mechanisms.

I removed exception about loops because the exception made the rule equivalent to RSPEC-1439. I also removed it from built-in profiles in JS
