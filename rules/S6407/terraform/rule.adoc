App Engine supports encryption in transit through TLS. As soon as the app is deployed, it can be requested using `appspot.com` domains or custom domains. By default, endpoints accept both clear-text and encrypted traffic. When communication isn't encrypted, there is a risk that an attacker could intercept it and read confidential information.

When creating an App Engine, request handlers can be set with different security level for encryption:


* `SECURE_NEVER`: only HTTP requests are allowed (HTTPS requests are redirected to HTTP).
* `SECURE_OPTIONAL` and `SECURE_DEFAULT`: both HTTP and HTTPS requests are allowed.
* `SECURE_ALWAYS`:  only HTTPS requests are allowed (HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS).


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The handler serves confidential data in HTTP responses.

There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended for App Engine handlers to require TLS for all traffic. It can be achieved by setting the security level to `SECURE_ALWAYS`.


== Sensitive Code Example
`SECURE_DEFAULT`, `SECURE_NEVER` and `SECURE_OPTIONAL` are sensitive TLS security level:
[source,terraform]
----
resource "google_app_engine_standard_app_version" "example" {
  version_id = "v1"
  service    = "default"
  runtime    = "nodejs"

  handlers {
    url_regex                   = ".*"
    redirect_http_response_code = "REDIRECT_HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE_301"
    security_level              = "SECURE_OPTIONAL" # Sensitive
    script {
      script_path = "auto"
    }
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

Force the use of TLS for the handler by setting the security level on `SECURE_ALWAYS`:
[source,terraform]
----
resource "google_app_engine_standard_app_version" "example" {
  version_id = "v1"
  service    = "default"
  runtime    = "nodejs"

  handlers {
    url_regex                   = ".*"
    redirect_http_response_code = "REDIRECT_HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE_301"
    security_level              = "SECURE_ALWAYS" 
    script {
      script_path = "auto"
    }
  }
}

Make sure creating a App Engine handler without requiring TLS is safe here.
