App Engine offers encryption in transit, with support for TLS, but insecure connections can still be accepted. On an unsecured network, such as a public network, the risk of traffic being intercepted is high. When the data isn't encrypted, an attacker can intercept it and read confidential information.

When creating an App Engine, request handlers can be set with different level of encryption security:


* `SECURE_NEVER`: only HTTP requests are allowed (HTTPS requests are redirected to HTTP).
* `SECURE_OPTIONAL` and `SECURE_DEFAULT`: both HTTP and HTTPS requests are allowed.
* `SECURE_ALWAYS`:  only HTTPS requests are allowed (HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS).
