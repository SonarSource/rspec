App Engine supports encryption in transit through TLS. As soon as the app is deployed, it can be requested using `appspot.com` domains or custom domains. By default, endpoints accept both clear-text and encrypted traffic. When communication isn't encrypted, there is a risk that an attacker could intercept it and read confidential information.

When creating an App Engine, request handlers can be set with different security level for encryption:


* `SECURE_NEVER`: only HTTP requests are allowed (HTTPS requests are redirected to HTTP).
* `SECURE_OPTIONAL` and `SECURE_DEFAULT`: both HTTP and HTTPS requests are allowed.
* `SECURE_ALWAYS`:  only HTTPS requests are allowed (HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS).
