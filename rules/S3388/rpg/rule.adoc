Testing ``++%PARMS++`` before the use of one or more parameters is a clear indication in the code that at least some parameters are treated as optional. However, failure to actually mark those parameters as such with ``++options( *nopass )++`` denies callers the ability to treat them as optional. Since all parameters after the first one explicitly declared ``++options( *nopass )++`` are also implicitly optional, this marking is only required once. However, for clarity you should consider explicitly marking all optional parameters.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
       DCL-PR VIOLATION1 EXTPGM;  // Noncompliant
         LASTNAME Char(10);
         FIRSTNAME Char(10);
       END-PR;

       DCL-PI VIOLATION1;
         LASTNAME Char(10);
         FIRSTNAME Char(10);
       END-PI;

       dsply FIRSTNAME;
       IF %PARMS > 1;
         dsply LASTNAME;
       EndIf;
       *inlr = *on;

== Compliant Solution

----
       DCL-PR VIOLATION1 EXTPGM; 
         LASTNAME Char(10);
         FIRSTNAME Char(10)  options( *nopass );
       END-PR;

       DCL-PI VIOLATION1;
         LASTNAME Char(10);
         FIRSTNAME Char(10)  options( *nopass );
       END-PI;

       dsply FIRSTNAME;
       IF %PARMS > 1;
         dsply LASTNAME;
       EndIf;
       *inlr = *on;
