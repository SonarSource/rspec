<p>Granting read permissions at the workflow level applies those permissions to all jobs in the workflow by default. This violates the principle of least privilege, as jobs that don&#8217;t require these read permissions will still inherit them unnecessarily.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When read permissions are granted at the workflow level, all jobs inherit these permissions regardless of whether they need them. This creates several security risks:</p>

<h4 id="_unauthorized_reconnaissance">Unauthorized reconnaissance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jobs with unnecessary <code>pull-requests: read</code> or <code>issues: read</code> permissions could be exploited to gather sensitive information from pull request discussions, issue comments, or code review feedback. This information could reveal security vulnerabilities, internal processes, or other sensitive details that could be used for targeted attacks.</p>

<h4 id="_security_event_exposure">Security event exposure</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jobs that inherit <code>security-events: read</code> permissions could access security vulnerability data, dependency information, or other security-related metadata. While this information may seem less critical than write access, it could still be used by attackers to identify vulnerable components or plan targeted attacks based on known security issues.</p>

<p>Move sensitive permissions from the workflow level to individual job levels. Only grant permissions at the job level to jobs that actually require them. This ensures that each job receives only the minimum permissions necessary for its function.</p>

<h3 id="_how_does_this_work">How does this work?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key difference lies in how GitHub Actions applies permissions at different levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workflow-level permissions</strong>: When permissions are declared at the workflow level, they become the default permissions for all jobs in that workflow. Each job automatically inherits these permissions unless explicitly overridden at the job level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job-level permissions</strong>: When permissions are declared at the job level, they apply only to that specific job. If no permissions are declared at the workflow level, jobs without explicit permissions default to read-only access. If permissions are declared at both levels, the job-level permissions override the workflow-level permissions for that specific job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By placing permissions at the job level, you ensure that each job receives only the permissions it explicitly declares, preventing unnecessary permission inheritance and reducing the attack surface of your workflows.</p>
