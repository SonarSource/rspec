== Why is this an issue?

If a struct does not provide `Equals` and `GetHashCode`, then the default versions of these methods from `System.ValueType` are used.

There are a couple of reasons why they won't be as efficient as a custom version written by hand for a specific type:
  
  * Boxing allocation
  * Potential collisions of the default `GetHashCode` implementation that just returns a hash code of the first non-null field
  * Reflection-based implementation is very slow
