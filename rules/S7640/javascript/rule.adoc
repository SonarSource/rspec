This rule raises an issue when a class defines multiple uppercase class attributes with simple values, resembling an enumeration pattern, instead of using Python's built-in `enum` module.

== Why is this an issue?

Using regular classes to simulate enumerations is a common anti-pattern that misses the benefits of Python's built-in `enum` module.

When you create enum-like structures using regular classes with class attributes, you lose several important features:

* *Type safety*: Class attributes can be accidentally modified at runtime, leading to bugs that are hard to track down.
* *Enumeration behavior*: You cannot iterate over the values or use built-in enum methods like `list(Status)` to get all possible values.
* *Validation*: There's no automatic validation that a value belongs to the enumeration.
* *Debugging support*: Enum members have better string representations and debugging information.
* *IDE support*: Modern IDEs provide better autocomplete and type checking for proper enums.

Python's `enum` module, introduced in Python 3.4, provides a robust foundation for creating enumerations that are immutable, iterable, and type-safe. Using the standard library approach makes your code more maintainable and follows established Python conventions.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using class-based pseudo-enums instead of proper enums can lead to runtime errors when values are accidentally modified, makes code harder to debug and maintain, and reduces the effectiveness of static analysis tools and IDE support.

=== How to fix?


Replace the class-based enum pattern with Python's built-in `Enum` class. Import the `Enum` class from the `enum` module and inherit from it.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Status:
    PENDING = 'pending'
    APPROVED = 'approved'
    REJECTED = 'rejected'  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
from enum import Enum

class Status(Enum):
    PENDING = 'pending'
    APPROVED = 'approved'
    REJECTED = 'rejected'
