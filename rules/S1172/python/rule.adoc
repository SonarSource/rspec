== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

This rule ignores overriding methods.

[source,python]
----
class C(B):
  def do_something(self, a, b): # no issue reported on b
    return self.compute(a)
----

This rule also ignores variables named with a single underscore `_`. Such naming is a common practice for indicating that the variable is insignificant.

[source,python]
----
def do_something(a, _): # no issue reported on _
  return compute(a)
----

The rule also won't raise an issue if the parameter is referenced in a docstring or a comment:

[source,python]
----
class MyClass:
    def do_something(self, my_param): # no issue reported
      # Overrides may use my_param to ...
      return compute(a)
----

[source,python]
----
class MyClass:
    def do_something(self, my_param): # no issue reported
      """Overrides may use my_param to ..."""
      return compute(a)
----

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def do_something(a, b): # second parameter is unused
  return compute(a)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
def do_something(a):
  return compute(a)
----
