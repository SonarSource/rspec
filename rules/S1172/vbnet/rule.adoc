Unused parameters are misleading. Whatever the values passed to such parameters, the behavior will be the same.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++private++`` procedure of a ``++Class++``, ``++Module++`` or ``++Structure++`` takes a parameter without using it.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Private Sub DoSomething(ByVal a As Integer, ByVal b as Integer) ' "b" is unused
    Compute(a)
End Sub

Private Function DoSomething2(ByVal a As Integer, ByVal b As Integer) As Integer ' "a" is unused 
    Compute(b)
    Return b
End Function
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Private Sub DoSomething(ByVal a As Integer)
    Compute(a)
End Sub

Private Function DoSomething2(ByVal b As Integer) As Integer
    Compute(b)
    Return b
End Function
----

== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise any issue in the following contexts:


* Procedures decorated with attributes.
* Empty procedures.
* Procedures which only throw ``++NotImplementedException++``.
* Main methods.
* ``++virtual++``, ``++override++`` procedures.
* Interface implementations.
* Event handlers.
