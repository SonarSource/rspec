== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

This rule raises an issue when a `private` method or constructor of a class/struct takes a parameter without using it.

=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise any issue in the following contexts:

* The `this` parameter of extension methods.
* Methods decorated with attributes.
* Empty methods.
* Methods which only throw `NotImplementedException`.
* The Main method of the application.
* `virtual`, `override` methods.
* interface implementations.

== How to fix it

include::../how-to-fix-it.adoc[]

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
private void DoSomething(int a, int b) // Noncompliant, "b" is unused
{
    Compute(a);
}

private void DoSomething2(int a) // Noncompliant, the value of "a" is unused
{
    a = 10;
    Compute(a);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
private void DoSomething(int a)
{
    Compute(a);
}

private void DoSomething2()
{
    var a = 10;
    Compute(a);
}
----

\[~freddy.mallet] Shall we ignore all empty methods or only public ones? If you say all of them, shall we also ignore empty Ctor?

About ``++static void Main(string[] args)++`` do you mean we also ignore the argument even if the method is not empty?

My suggestions:

* Ignore all empty methods including constructors (they should be flagged by another issue anyway)
* Yes, since Main(string[] args) is a 'non-negotiable' signature, we should ignore the case where 'args' is not used.

The new description matches the existing implementation. It just explains more precisely what cases raise an issue.
