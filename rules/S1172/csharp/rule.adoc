== Why is this an issue?

Unused parameters are misleading. Whatever the values passed to such parameters, the behavior will be the same.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++private++`` method or constructor of a class/struct takes a parameter without using it.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
private void DoSomething(int a, int b) // "b" is unused
{
    Compute(a);
}

private void DoSomething2(int a) // value of "a" is unused
{
    a = 10;
    Compute(a);
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
private void DoSomething(int a)
{
    Compute(a);
}

private void DoSomething2()
{
    var a = 10;
    Compute(a);
}
----

=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise any issue in the following contexts:


* The ``++this++`` parameter of extension methods.
* Methods decorated with attributes.
* Empty methods.
* Methods which only throw ``++NotImplementedException++``.
* Main methods.
* ``++virtual++``, ``++override++`` methods.
* interface implementations.
