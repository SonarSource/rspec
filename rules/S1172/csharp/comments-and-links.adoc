\[~freddy.mallet] Shall we ignore all empty methods or only public ones? If you say all of them, shall we also ignore empty Ctor?

About ``++static void Main(string[] args)++`` do you mean we also ignore the argument even if the method is not empty?

My suggestions:

* Ignore all empty methods including constructors (they should be flagged by another issue anyway)
* Yes, since Main(string[] args) is a 'non-negotiable' signature, we should ignore the case where 'args' is not used.
