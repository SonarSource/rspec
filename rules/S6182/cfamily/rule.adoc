== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces a new keyword ``++constinit++`` that requires initialization of the variable to be done at compile time.


The similarity in the names might raise confusion between ``++constexpr++``, ``++const++``, and ``++constinit++``:

* ``++const++`` prohibits the changes to a variable after its initialization. It does not restrict the initializer in any way.
* ``++constinit++`` does not prohibit variable changes after initialization, it only restricts the initializer expression to compile time.
* ``++constexpr++`` is ``++const constinit++`` + "constant destruction": it requires that the variable is initialized at compile time and that it is never changed, plus it requires the type to have _constant destruction_, i.e., a plain type or a class type with a ``++constexpr++`` destructor.

To address the confusion this rule reports ``++constinit++`` variables that are ``++const++`` or effectively ``++const++`` (i.e., never modified) and have constant destruction.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
constinit float pi = 3.14f; // Noncompliant
// ... pi is never modified
const constinit float e = 2.72f; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr float pi = 3.14f;
constexpr float e = 2.72f;
----
