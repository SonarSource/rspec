== Why is this an issue?

Classes that declare an implementation of ``++Serializable++`` should provide a serializable constructor. Without such a constructor, you'll be unable to deserialize the class.


Serialization constructors should be ``++private++`` for ``++sealed++`` types and ``++protected++`` otherwise.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
[Serializable]
public class Person : ISerializable {  // Noncompliant; missing serializable constructor
  public void GetObjectData (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) {
    // ...
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
[Serializable]
public class Person : ISerializable {  // Noncompliant; missing serializable constructor

  protected Person (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) {
    // ...
  }

  public void GetObjectData (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) {
    // ...
  }
}
