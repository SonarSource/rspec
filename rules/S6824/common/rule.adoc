== Why is this an issue?

This rule checks that ARIA roles or `aria-*` attributes are not used in unsupported DOM elements, which are mostly invisible such as `meta`, `html` or `head`.

== How to fix it

Check if you are using ARIA roles or `aria-*` attributes in unsupported DOM elements.

<title aria-hidden="false">My beautiful web page</title>

To fix the code, remove the extra ARIA role or `aria-*` attributes from the unsupported DOM elements.
