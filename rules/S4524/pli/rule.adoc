== Why is this an issue?

``++SELECT++`` can contain an ``++OTHERWISE++`` clause for various reasons: to handle unexpected values, to show that all the cases were properly considered.

For readability purpose, to help a developer to quickly find the default behavior of a ``++SELECT++`` statement, it is recommended to put the ``++OTHERWISE++`` clause at the end of the ``++SELECT++`` statement. This rule raises an issue if the ``++OTHERWISE++`` clause is not the first or the last one of the ``++SELECT++``'s cases.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,pli]
----
foo: proc options(main);
  declare i fixed decimal init (42);

  select (i);
    when (0) put list ('i = 0');
    otherwise put list ('i = 2'); /* Non-Compliant */
    when (1) put list ('i = 1');
  end;
end;
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,pli]
----
foo: proc options(main);
  declare i fixed decimal init (42);

  select (i); /* Compliant */
    when (0) put list ('i = 0');
    when (1) put list ('i = 1');
    otherwise put list ('i = 2');
  end;
end;
