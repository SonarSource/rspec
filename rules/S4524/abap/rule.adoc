== Why is this an issue?

``++CASE++`` can contain a ``++WHEN OTHERS++`` clause for various reasons: to handle unexpected values, to show that all the cases were properly considered, etc.

For readability purposes, to help a developer quickly spot the default behavior of a ``++CASE++`` statement, it is recommended to put the ``++WHEN OTHERS++`` clause at the end of the ``++CASE++`` statement.

This rule raises an issue if the ``++WHEN OTHERS++`` clause is not the last one of the ``++CASE++``'s cases.
