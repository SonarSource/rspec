== Why is this an issue?

``++switch++`` can contain a ``++default++`` clause for various reasons: to handle unexpected values, to show that all the cases were properly considered, etc.

For readability purposes, to help a developer quickly spot the default behavior of a ``++switch++`` statement, it is recommended to put the ``++default++`` clause at the end of the ``++switch++`` statement.

This rule raises an issue if the ``++default++`` clause is not the last one of the ``++switch++``'s cases.

switch (param) {
  case 0:
    doSomething();
    break;
  default: // Noncompliant: default clause should be the last one
    error();
    break;
  case 1:
    doSomethingElse();
    break;
}
