== Why is this an issue?

``++switch++`` can contain a ``++default++`` clause for various reasons: to handle unexpected values, to show that all the cases were properly considered.

For readability purpose, to help a developer to quickly find the default behavior of a ``++switch++`` statement, it is recommended to put the ``++default++`` clause at the beginning or the end of the ``++switch++`` statement. This rule raises an issue if the ``++default++`` clause is not the first or the last one of the ``++switch++``'s cases.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,go]
----
switch tag {
case 0, 1, 2, 3:
	foo()
default:  // Noncompliant; default case should be the first or last one
	qix()
case 4, 5, 6, 7:
	bar()
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,go]
----
switch tag {
default:
	qix() // Compliant; default is the first one
case 0, 1, 2, 3:
	foo()
case 4, 5, 6, 7:
	bar()
}
----

[source,go]
----
switch tag {
case 0, 1, 2, 3:
	foo()
case 4, 5, 6, 7:
	bar()
default:
	qix() // Compliant; default is the last one
}
