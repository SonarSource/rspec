Having several levels of nested SQL SELECT statements makes the code difficult to read and should therefore be avoided.


== Noncompliant Code Example

With an allowed nesting level of 2:

----
*> Non-Compliant
EXEC SQL
  SELECT * FROM my_table1 WHERE
    my_column1 IN
      (SELECT my_column2 FROM my_table2
        WHERE my_column3 IN
          (SELECT my_column4 FROM my_table3))
END-EXEC.
----


== Compliant Solution

----
EXEC SQL
  SELECT * FROM my_table
END-EXEC.
----
