== Why is this an issue?

Having several levels of nested SQL SELECT statements makes the code difficult to read and should therefore be avoided.


=== Noncompliant code example

With an allowed nesting level of 2:

[source,cobol]
----
*> Non-Compliant
EXEC SQL
  SELECT * FROM my_table1 WHERE
    my_column1 IN
      (SELECT my_column2 FROM my_table2
        WHERE my_column3 IN
          (SELECT my_column4 FROM my_table3))
END-EXEC.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cobol]
----
EXEC SQL
  SELECT * FROM my_table
END-EXEC.
