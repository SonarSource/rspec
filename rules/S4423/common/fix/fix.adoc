As a rule of thumb, by default you should use the cryptographic algorithms and
mechanisms that are considered strong by the cryptographic community.

The best choices at the moment are the following.

==== Use TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3
Even though TLS V1.3 is available, using TLS v1.2 is still considered good and
secure practice by the cryptography community. +

The use of TLS v1.2 ensures compatibility with a wide range of platforms and
enables seamless communication between different systems that do not yet have
TLS v1.3 support.

The only drawback depends on whether the framework used is outdated: its TLS
v1.2 settings may enable older and insecure cipher suites that are deprecated
as insecure.

On the other hand, TLS v1.3 removes support for older and weaker cryptographic
algorithms, eliminates known vulnerabilities from previous TLS versions, and
improves performance.
