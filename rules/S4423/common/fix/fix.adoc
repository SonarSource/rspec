As a rule of thumb, use the cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms that are
considered strong by the cryptographic community, and make sure that systems
use them by default.

The best choices at the moment are the following.

==== Use TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3
Even though TLS V1.3 is available, using TLS v1.2 is still considered good and
secure practice in the cryptographic community. +
Using TLS v1.2 ensures compatibility with a wide range of platforms and
allows seamless communication between different systems that do not yet support
TLS v1.3.

The only drawback is depending on whether the framework used is outdated: its
TLS v1.2 settings may turn on older and insecure cipher suites that are
deprecated as insecure.

On the other hand, TLS v1.3 removes support for older and weaker cryptographic
algorithms, closes known security holes in previous versions, and improves
performance.
