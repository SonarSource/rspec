As a rule of thumb, use the cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms that are
considered strong by the cryptographic community, and make sure systems always
use them, by default.
Make sure that the minimum TLS version used is a strong one. In general,
weakening security in favor of legacy compatibility is an easy target for attackers.

regardless of the protocol used or connection method, a strong TLS version should be used.
The best choices are currently the following.

==== TLS V1.2
