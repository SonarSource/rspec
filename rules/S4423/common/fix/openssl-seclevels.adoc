==== OpenSSL Security Levels

OpenSSL introduced security levels in version 1.1.0 to provide a simplified way to configure cryptographic security requirements. The security level system uses numeric values from 0 to 5, where higher numbers represent stricter security requirements.

===== Security Level 0 (SECLEVEL=0)

Setting `SECLEVEL=0` explicitly disables OpenSSL's security level restrictions, allowing the use of Weak cipher suites and older TLS protocols.

===== Default Security Levels

When no security level is specified, OpenSSL uses the default security level (typically 1 or 2 depending on the version), which blocks weak cipher suites and older TLS protocols.

The compliant solution removes the `SECLEVEL=0` configuration, allowing OpenSSL to use its secure default security level, which provides strong cryptographic protection.
