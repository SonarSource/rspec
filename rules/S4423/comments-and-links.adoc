\[~alexandre.gigleux] There's a different https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#sslcontext-algorithms[list for java 9] which contains 3 "new" protocols: DTLS, DTLSv1.0 and DTLSv1.2. Should they also be considered as weak?

According to \https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525#page-6 (3.1.2. DTLS Protocol Versions), here is the mapping between DTLS and TLS:


Version 1.0 of DTLS correlates to version 1.1 of TLS

Version 1.2 of DTLS correlates to version 1.2 of TLS


As a consequence, we should consider DTLS and DTLSv1.0 in the "weak" list.

We should generalize this rule to: "Weak SSL protocols should not be used"
