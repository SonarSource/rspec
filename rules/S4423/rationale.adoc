Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring secure communications in a variety of domains. They are used for
several important reasons:

* Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection.
* Security during transmission or on storage devices.
* Data integrity, general trust, and authentication.

When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also
consider two things:

1. No encryption is absolutely unbreakable.
2. The strength of an encryption is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame.

For these reasons, as soon as cryptography is included in a project, it is
important to choose encryption algorithms that are considered the strongest by
the cryptography community.

To provide communication security over a network, SSL and TLS are generally
used. However, it is important to note that the following protocols are all
considered weak by the cryptographic community, and are officially deprecated:

* SSL versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.
* TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1.

These two TLS versions are deprecated since
