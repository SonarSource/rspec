This rule raises an issue when an insecure TLS protocol version (i.e. a protocol different from "TLSv1.2", "TLSv1.3", "DTLSv1.2", or "DTLSv1.3") is used or allowed.

If a client can choose the TLS protocol version the connection might be vulnerable to downgrade attacks that allows an attacker who is able to intercept the connection to modify the requested protocol version and downgrade it to a less secure version.
