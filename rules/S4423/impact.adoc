=== What is the potential impact?

The cleartext of an encrypted message transmitted over the network might be
recoverable.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

====  Theft of sensitive data

The encrypted message might contain data that is considered sensitive and should
not be known to third parties.

By using a weak cryptographical protocol, the likelihood that an attacker might
be able to recover the cleartext drastically increases.

====  Additional attack surface

By intercepting, modifying, and sending back a corrupted cleartext of the
encrypted message it might be possible for an attacker to trigger other
vulnerabilities in the code. +
Encrypted values are often considered trusted, since under normal circumstances
it would not be possible for a third party to modify them.
