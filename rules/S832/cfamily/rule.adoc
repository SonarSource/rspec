If a variable is only to be used by functions within the same file then use the ``++static++`` storage class specifier. Similarly if a function is only called from elsewhere within the same file, it should be ``++static++``. Use of the ``++static++`` storage-class specifier will ensure that the identifier is only visible in the file in which it is declared, and avoids any possibility of confusion with an identical identifier in another file or a library.
