== Why is this an issue?

By default tests will run in system mode, i.e. without taking into account users permissions. In order to be realistic, a test needs to run Business logic code in User context. This is done by encapsulating the tested code in https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_testing_tools_runas.htm[``++System.runAs()++``].


This rule raises an issue when a test function, i.e. a function annotated with ``++@isTest++`` or ``++testMethod++``, does not contain a ``++System.runAs()++`` call.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,apex]
----
@isTest
private class TestClass {
    @isTest
    public static void testMethod() { // NonCompliant
        // Setup test data
        User u = new User(...);
        Case c = new Case (Name = 'Test');
        Test.startTest();
            Insert c;
        Test.stopTest();
    }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,apex]
----
@isTest
private class TestClass {
    @isTest
    public static void testMethod() {
        // Setup test data
        User u = new User(...);
        Case c = new Case (Name = 'Test');
        System.runAs(u) {
            Test.startTest();
            Insert c;
            Test.stopTest();
        }
    }
}
----


=== Exceptions

No issue will be raised if the test class, i.e. the class annotated with ``++@isTest++``, contains helper methods, i.e. methods *not* annotated with ``++@isTest++`` or ``++testmethod++``, which contain calls to ``++System.runAs()++``. This indicates that the test code has been factorized and the rule would raise false positives.
