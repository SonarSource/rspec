== How to fix it

The first `<tr>` of the table should contain `<th>` elements, with the appropriate description of what the data in those columns represents.

=== Going the extra mile

Headers should be properly associated with the corresponding `<td>` cells by using either a `scope` attribute or `headers` and `id` attributes.
