<p>The name of each section should be unique within a program because section names cannot be qualified. Often code with duplicate section names will not compile. When it does, sections with duplicate names are ignored, meaning those sections are dead code. Even if dead code were not an anti-pattern on its own, having two sections with the same name will inevitably lead to maintenance mistakes. Therefore duplicative section names should be changed, or the extra sections should be removed.</p>

<p>\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] I&#8217;m really reluctant to write this rule not knowing what the negative consequence is. Do you have any way of testing? I&#8217;ve tried unsuccessfully to research this, and since you say Open Cobol&#8217;s not quite the same as what our customers are using, I&#8217;m thinking it wouldn&#8217;t offer valid experimental proof (even if I could figure out the syntax to keep it from choking on "SECTION").</p>
