Labeled blocks are useful, especially when the code is badly indented, to match the begin and end of each block. This check detects labeled blocks which are missing an ending label.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
<<myBlockLabel1>>
BEGIN
  NULL;
END; -- Noncompliant; this labeled loop has no ending label
/

BEGIN
  NULL; -- Compliant; not a labeled block
END;
/
----

== Compliant Solution

----
<<myBlockLabel2>>
BEGIN
  NULL;
END myBlockLabel2;
/

BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
