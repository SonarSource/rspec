== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++File.createTempFile++`` as the first step in creating a temporary directory causes a race condition and is inherently unreliable and insecure. Instead, ``++Files.createTempDirectory++`` (Java 7+) or a library function such as Guava's similarly-named ``++Files.createTempDir++`` should be used.


This rule raises an issue when the following steps are taken in immediate sequence:

* call to ``++File.createTempFile++``
* delete resulting file
* call ``++mkdir++`` on the File object

*Note* that this rule is automatically disabled when the project's ``++sonar.java.source++`` is lower than ``++7++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
File tempDir;
tempDir = File.createTempFile("", ".");
tempDir.delete();
tempDir.mkdir();  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
Path tempPath = Files.createTempDirectory("");
File tempDir = tempPath.toFile();
----
