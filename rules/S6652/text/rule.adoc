Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
hardcoded inside the source code of an application. When this application is
deployed to a running environment or the source code is stored in a centralized
repository, those secrets might get exposed to an unintended audience.

== Why is this an issue?

In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code storage location or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don't need to know the secret might get access to it.
The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people's role and
entitlement.

=== What is the potential impact?

The consequences vary greatly depending on the situation and the secret-exposed
audience. Still, two main scenarios should be considered.

==== Financial loss

Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.

This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.

Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application's
users.

==== Application's security downgrade

A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect
security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the
affected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive
information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting server
or another linked component.

For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user
authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation. An
attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary
users and take over their privileges and entitlements.

== How to fix it

=== Revoke the secret

Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.

For that step to be successful, the secret use must be audited in order to make
sure the revocation does not disrupt any existing process or other applications.

=== Analyze recent secret use

When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.

This operation should be part of a global incident response process.

=== Use a secret vault

A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This one
will ensure the secret's security and any further unexpected disclosure.

Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
props.set("client_secret", "ghp_xd8KRQmqM8eGCdegBLeO5AJ4oS0VN3yWXWcw")
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
VaultEndpoint vaultEndpoint = new VaultEndpoint();
vaultEndpoint.setHost("myvault.example.org");
vaultEndpoint.setPort(8200);
vaultEndpoint.setScheme("https");

String appRoleId    = System.getenv("VAULT_APPROLE_ROLE_ID");
String secretIdFile = System.getenv("VAULT_APPROLE_SECRET_ID_FILE");

VaultToken wrappedToken = VaultToken.of(getSecretIDFromFilePath(secretIdFile));

AppRoleAuthenticationOptions options = AppRoleAuthenticationOptions
        .builder()
        .secretId(SecretId.wrapped(wrappedToken))
        .roleId(RoleId.provided(appRoleId))
        .build();

EnvironmentVaultConfiguration config = new EnvironmentVaultConfiguration();

VaultTemplate vaultTemplate = new VaultTemplate(
        vaultEndpoint,
        new AppRoleAuthentication(options, restOperations()));

Versioned<Map<String, Object>> readResponse = vaultTemplate
        .opsForVersionedKeyValue("secret")
        .get("github_token");

String password = "";
if (readResponse != null && readResponse.hasData()) {
    props.set("client_secret", readResponse.getData().get("password"));
}
