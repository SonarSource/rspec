== Why is this an issue?

The cyclomatic complexity of methods should not exceed a defined threshold.

Complex code can perform poorly and will in any case be difficult to understand and therefore to maintain.

=== Exceptions

While having a large number of fields in a class may indicate that it should be split, this rule nonetheless ignores high complexity in ``++equals++`` and ``++hashCode++`` methods.
