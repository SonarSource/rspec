== Why is this an issue?

Certain mathematical comparisons will always return the same value, and should simply not be made. 

These comparisons will return either always `true` or always `false` depending on the kind of comparison:

* Comparing a `char` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `char`.
* Comparing a `float` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `float`.
* Comparing a `long` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `long`.
* Comparing a `ulong` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `ulong`.
