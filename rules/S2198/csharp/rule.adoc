== Why is this an issue?

Certain https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/comparison-operators[mathematical comparisons] will always return the same value, and should not be performed. 

Specifically, the following comparisons will return either always `true` or always `false` depending on the kind of comparison:

* comparing a `char` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `char`
* comparing a `float` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `float`
* comparing a `long` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `long`
* comparing a `ulong` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `ulong`

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
float f = 42.0f;
if (f <= double.MaxValue) { } // Noncompliant: always true
if (f > double.MaxValue) { }  // Noncompliant: always false
