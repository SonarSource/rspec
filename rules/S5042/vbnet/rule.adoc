== Sensitive Code Example

----
For Each entry As ZipArchiveEntry in archive.Entries
    ' entry.FullName could contain parent directory references ".." and the destinationPath variable could become outside of the desired path
    string destinationPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(path, entry.FullName))
    entry.ExtractToFile(destinationPath) ' Sensitive, extracts the entry to a file

    Dim stream As Stream
    stream = entry.Open() ' Sensitive, the entry is about to be extracted
Next
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Const ThresholdRatio As Double = 10
Const ThresholdSize As Integer = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ' 1 GB
Const ThresholdEntries As Integer = 10000
Dim TotalSizeArchive, TotalEntryArchive, TotalEntrySize, Cnt As Integer
Dim Buffer(1023) As Byte
Using ZipToOpen As New FileStream("ZipBomb.zip", FileMode.Open), Archive As New ZipArchive(ZipToOpen, ZipArchiveMode.Read)
    For Each Entry As ZipArchiveEntry In Archive.Entries
        Using s As Stream = Entry.Open
            TotalEntryArchive += 1
            TotalEntrySize = 0
            Do
                Cnt = s.Read(Buffer, 0, Buffer.Length)
                TotalEntrySize += Cnt
                TotalSizeArchive += Cnt
                If TotalEntrySize / Entry.CompressedLength > ThresholdRatio Then Exit Do    ' Ratio between compressed And uncompressed data Is highly suspicious, looks Like a Zip Bomb Attack
            Loop While Cnt > 0
        End Using
        If TotalSizeArchive > ThresholdSize Then Exit For       ' The uncompressed data size Is too much for the application resource capacity
        If TotalEntryArchive > ThresholdEntries Then Exit For   ' Too much entries in this archive, can lead to inodes exhaustion of the system
    Next
End Using
