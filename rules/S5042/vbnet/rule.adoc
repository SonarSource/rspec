== Sensitive Code Example

----
For Each entry As ZipArchiveEntry in archive.Entries
    ' entry.FullName could contain parent directory references ".." and the destinationPath variable could become outside of the desired path
    string destinationPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(path, entry.FullName))
    entry.ExtractToFile(destinationPath) ' Sensitive, extracts the entry to a file

    Dim stream As Stream
    stream = entry.Open() ' Sensitive, the entry is about to be extracted
Next

Const ThresholdRatio As Double = 10

                TotalEntrySize += Cnt
                TotalSizeArchive += Cnt
                If TotalEntrySize / Entry.CompressedLength > ThresholdRatio Then Exit Do    ' Ratio between compressed And uncompressed data Is highly suspicious, looks Like a Zip Bomb Attack
            Loop While Cnt > 0
        End Using
        If TotalSizeArchive > ThresholdSize Then Exit For       ' The uncompressed data size Is too much for the application resource capacity
        If TotalEntryArchive > ThresholdEntries Then Exit For   ' Too much entries in this archive, can lead to inodes exhaustion of the system
    Next
End Using
