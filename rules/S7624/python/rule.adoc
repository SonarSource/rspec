This rule raises an issue when a Django URL pattern is defined without a `name` parameter in the `path()` or `re_path()` function call.

== Why is this an issue?

Django URL patterns without name parameters make code harder to maintain and violate the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

When you hardcode URL paths throughout your Django application - in templates, views, and tests - you create multiple places where the same URL information is duplicated. If you need to change a URL later, you must remember to update it everywhere it appears. This is error-prone and time-consuming.

Named URLs solve this problem by providing a single canonical location for each URL definition. Once you assign a name to a URL pattern, you can reference it using Django's `reverse()` function in Python code or the `{% url %}` template tag in templates.

For example, instead of hardcoding `/about/` in multiple places, you can reference it by name like `{% url 'about' %}`. If you later decide to change the URL to `/about-us/`, you only need to update the URL pattern definition - all references using the name will automatically work with the new path.

Named URLs also enable powerful Django features like reverse URL resolution, which is essential for creating maintainable web applications. Many Django utilities and third-party packages expect URLs to have names to function properly.

=== What is the potential impact?

Without named URL parameters, applications become harder to maintain and more prone to broken links. When URL paths need to change, developers must manually find and update every hardcoded reference throughout the codebase, increasing the risk of missing updates and creating 404 errors. This technical debt accumulates over time, making the application more fragile and expensive to maintain.

=== How to fix?


Add a `name` parameter to the URL pattern. Choose a descriptive name that clearly identifies the purpose of the URL.

----
# pages/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import home_page_view, AboutPageView

urlpatterns = [
    path("about/", AboutPageView.as_view()),  # Noncompliant
    path("", home_page_view),  # Noncompliant
]

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
# pages/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import home_page_view, AboutPageView

urlpatterns = [
    path("about/", AboutPageView.as_view(), name="about"),
    path("", home_page_view, name="home"),
