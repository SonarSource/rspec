This rule raises an issue when test classes are located in the main source directory (`src/main/java`) instead of the test directory (`src/test/java`), or when test classes don't maintain the same package structure as the classes they test.

== Why is this an issue?

Proper test organization is essential for maintainable Java projects. Test classes should be separated from production code and follow consistent package structures.

When test classes are placed in the main source directory (`src/main/java`), they become part of the production codebase. This creates several problems:

* Test code may be accidentally included in production builds, increasing the application size unnecessarily
* Testing dependencies (like JUnit) may be required in production environments
* The separation of concerns between production and test code is violated

Additionally, when test classes don't follow the same package structure as the classes they test, it becomes harder to:

* Locate tests for specific production classes
* Maintain consistency across the codebase
* Navigate between production code and its corresponding tests
* Understand the relationship between test and production code

Modern build tools like Maven and Gradle expect test classes to be in the `src/test/java` directory structure. Following this convention ensures compatibility with standard tooling and build processes.

=== What is the potential impact?

Misorganized test classes can lead to:

* Test code being accidentally deployed to production environments
* Increased application size due to unnecessary test dependencies
* Reduced code maintainability and developer productivity
* Confusion about code organization and testing structure
* Build tool compatibility issues

=== How to fix?


Move test classes from the main source directory to the test directory while maintaining the same package structure.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// File: src/main/java/com/example/math/CircleTest.java
package com.example.math;

import org.junit.Test;

public class CircleTest { // Noncompliant
    @Test
    public void testCalculateArea() {
        // test implementation
    }
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// File: src/test/java/com/example/math/CircleTest.java
package com.example.math;

import org.junit.Test;

public class CircleTest {
    @Test
    public void testCalculateArea() {
        // test implementation
    }
}
