This rule raises an issue when print() statements are found in Python code that may be deployed to production environments.

== Why is this an issue?

Print statements are commonly used during development for quick debugging, but they become problematic in production code for several reasons.

First, print statements send output directly to stdout, which can expose sensitive information like user data, API keys, or internal system details in production logs. This creates security risks and potential compliance violations.

Second, print statements cannot be easily controlled or filtered. Unlike proper logging, you cannot adjust their verbosity level or disable them without modifying the code. This makes it difficult to manage output in different environments.

Third, print statements can impact application performance, especially when they output large amounts of data or run frequently in loops. They also clutter production logs with information that may not be useful for monitoring or troubleshooting.

Finally, print statements make code less maintainable. They create inconsistent logging practices and make it harder to implement proper log management, monitoring, and alerting systems.

=== What is the potential impact?

Print statements in production can expose sensitive data in logs, create security vulnerabilities, impact application performance, and make log management and monitoring more difficult.

=== How to fix?


Remove print statements that were used for debugging purposes. If the information is needed for monitoring or troubleshooting, replace print statements with proper logging using Python's logging module.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def process_user_data(user_id, email):
    print(f"Processing user: {user_id}")  # Noncompliant
    print(f"Email: {email}")  # Noncompliant
    
    # Process user data
    result = perform_processing(user_id)
    
    print(f"Result: {result}")  # Noncompliant
    return result
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process_user_data(user_id, email):
    logger.info("Processing user: %s", user_id)
    logger.debug("Email: %s", email)
    
    # Process user data
    result = perform_processing(user_id)
    
    logger.info("Processing completed for user: %s", user_id)
    return result
