== Why is this an issue?

Reusing a ``++typedef++`` name either as another ``++typedef++`` name or for any other purpose may lead to developer confusion.


The same ``++typedef++`` shall not be duplicated anywhere in the project, even if the declarations are identical.


Note that where the type definition is made in a header file, and that header file is included in multiple source files, this rule is not violated.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
{
  typedef unsigned char uint8_t;
}

{
  typedef unsigned char uint8_t; // Noncompliant, redefinition
}

{
  unsigned char uint8_t; // Noncompliant, reuse of uint8_t for another purpose
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
typedef unsigned char uint8_t;
{
}

{
}

{
  unsigned char myChar;
}
----


== Resources

* MISRA C:2004, 5.3 - A typedef name shall be a unique identifier.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 2-10-3 - A typedef name (including qualification, if any) shall be a unique identifier.

\[~samuel.mercier] I've removed the 'convention' tag and bumped up the severity. I think the danger here is that from one part of the code you think ``++char++`` has one meaning and you take that understanding into another part of the code where it has been redefined. Thus, I find it tempting to move this to reliability, but I that's up to you.
