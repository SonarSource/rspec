Reusing a ``++typedef++`` name either as another ``++typedef++`` name or for any other purpose may lead to developer confusion.


The same ``++typedef++`` shall not be duplicated anywhere in the project, even if the declarations are identical.


Note that where the type definition is made in a header file, and that header file is included in multiple source files, this rule is not violated.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
{
  typedef unsigned char uint8_t;
}

{
  typedef unsigned char uint8_t; // Noncompliant, redefinition
}

{
  unsigned char uint8_t; // Noncompliant, reuse of uint8_t for another purpose
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
typedef unsigned char uint8_t;
{
}

{
}

{
  unsigned char myChar;
}
----

* MISRA C:2004, 5.3 - A typedef name shall be a unique identifier.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 2-10-3 - A typedef name (including qualification, if any) shall be a unique identifier.
