== Implementation Specification

=== Message

 * Make sure using unencrypted cloud storage is safe here.
 * Omitting {disk_encryption_set_id} enables clear-text storage. Make sure it is safe here.
 * For requireInfrastructureEncryption and infrastructureEncryption: Disabling infrastructure encryption will prevent double encryption of data. Make sure it is safe here.
