== Why is this an issue?

Both the `Enumerable.First` extension method and the `LinkedList<T>.First` property can be used to find the first value in a `LinkedList<T>`. However, `LinkedList<T>.First` is much faster than `Enumerable.First`. For small collections, the performance difference may be minor, but for large collections, it can be noticeable. The same applies for the `Last` property as well.
