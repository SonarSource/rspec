\[~loic.joly] The Noncompliant part seems to be on the wrong lines. Shouldn't it raise on the function signature rather than the call?


It seems to me that such a rule would raise many false positives. Ex: a function comparing two objects of the same type, merging them or doing something similar.

It would also encourage developers to reorder their arguments just to not raise an issue.

* Changed the position of noncompliant
* Two objects of the same type are ok, it is only triggered with 3 objects.
* Reordering would be a way to silence the issue, but for me, it would probably be an inferior solution most of the time. And I'm afraid that if we explicitly mention it, it might lead some developers to laziness (sweeping things under the rug), this is why I removed it from the first specification. I'm even wondering about removing the "consecutive" part of this rule... If you have a good example where reordering would lead to good code, let me know.

There are many functions for which 2 arguments of the same type are useful. For instance copying data from a source to a destination, or combining two elements into a third one (for instance, finding the GCD of 2 numbers). We felt that signaling those would raise far too many issues.

IMO you should add that to the description [~loic.joly]. Currently it seems totally arbitrary.
