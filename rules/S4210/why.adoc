== Why is this an issue?

In the context of a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/[Windows Forms] application, the program entry point, the `{entry-point}` method, should be marked with the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.stathreadattribute[`STAThreadAttribute`] to indicate that the threading model should be "Single-Threaded Apartment" (STA) which is the only one supported by Windows Forms.
