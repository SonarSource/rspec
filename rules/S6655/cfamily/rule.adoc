Accessing local objects outside of their scope (for example, via a pointer
taken inside the scope) has undefined behavior. This rule flags such
access for local variables and lifetime-extended temporaries.

== Why is this an issue?

Local variables in {cpp} are attached to the scope and destroyed when
the end of the scope is reached. Any access to a variable outside
of their scope has undefined behavior.

Such access occurs, for example, when the address of a variable is
stored in a pointer that is later dereferenced:

[source,cpp]
----
int func() {
  int* ptr = nullptr;
  {
    int i = 10;
    ptr = &i;
  } // variable i goes out of scope here
  *ptr = 10; // Noncompliant: writing to out-of-scope-variable
}
----

A similar defect can occur in code that does not have curly braces
(also referred to as a compound statement), but contain control
structures, like `if` or `for` that also introduce scope:

[source,cpp]
----
int exampleWithIf() {
  int* ptr;
  if (int i = 10)
    ptr = &i;
  else
    ptr = nullptr;
  // variable i declared in if condition statement goes out of scope here
  if (ptr)
    return *ptr; // Noncompliant: reading from out-of-scope variable
  return 0;
}
void exampleWithFor() {
  int* ptr = nullptr;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    ptr = &i;
  // variable i defined in for init-statement goes out of scope here
  *ptr = 10; // Noncompliant
}

=== Why is the issue raised for reference variables?

When a reference variable is directly initialized to a temporary object,
such temporary is lifetime-extended by the variable, i.e., the temporary
object is destroyed when the variable goes out of scope.
Lifetime-extended temporaries have the same behavior as if they were
declared as local variables and may lead to the same issues. For example:

[source,cpp]
----
Clazz create();
void refExtension(Clazz const arg) {
  Clazz const* aPtr;
  Clazz const* tPtr;
  {
    Clazz const& aRef = arg; // bounding reference to object arg
    Clazz const& tRef = create(); // temporary object is created here and bound to reference,
                                  // behaves as Clazz const tRef = create();
    aPtr = &aRef;  // points to arg
    tPtr = &tRef;  // point to a temporary object that is lifetime extended
  } // both aRef and tRef go out of scope here, because tRef was extending the lifetime of
    // temporary variable, the object is destroyed
  aPtr->foo(); // OK, a points to arg
  tPtr->foo(); // Noncompliant: the pointers point to a dangling temporary
}
----

== How to fix it

Commonly, the use of an out-of-scope local object is an indication of a defect in code,
where the local object was used by mistake, and in such case, replacing it with the
desired variable or removing the use is sufficient.
For other scenarios, two general approaches are possible:

* Extending the scope of the referenced variable
* Capturing a copy of the object instead of a pointer to it

Whenever possible, it is preferable to use or create a dedicated algorithm that
encapsulates the uses of pointers to local objects.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <span>
#include <optional>
std::optional<int> minimum(std::span<int const> s) {
  if (s.empty()) {
    return std::nullopt;
  }
  int const* min = nullptr;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
    if ((min == nullptr) || (*min < s[i]))
      min = &i;  // should be address of &s[i]
  }
  return *min; // Noncompliant: dangling
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Fixing the typo, and taking the address of `&s[i]`:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <span>
#include <optional>
std::optional<int> minimum(std::span<int const> s) {
  if (s.empty()) {
    return std::nullopt;
  }
  int const* min = nullptr;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
    if ((min == nullptr) || (*min < s[i]))
      min = &s[i];
  }
  return *min; // Compliant, points to an element of s
}
----

Storing a copy instead of a pointer:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <span>
#include <optional>
std::optional<int> minimum(span<int const> s) {
   std::optional<int> min;
   for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
      if (min.has_value() || (*min < s[i]))
        min = s[i];
   }
   return min; // Compliant, copy of the minimum element
}
----


Using a dedicated algorithm that avoids the need to store the pointer:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <span>
#include <optional>
#include <algorithm>
std::optional<int> minimum(std::span<int const> s) {
  auto it = std::min_element(s.begin(), s.end());
  if (it == s.end())
    return std::nullopt;
  return *it;
}
----

=== Pitfalls

Reducing the number of nested scopes is not always the right solution to fix
the issue because, for the variables that represent resources (using RAII idiom),
the scope of the variables plays an important role in the correctness of the program.
As an illustration, let's consider the following example that uses `std::unique_lock`
that represents a lock of a mutex:

[source,cpp]
----
std::mutex dataMutex;
Data data;
void process() {
  Element e;
  { // scope A
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> l1(dataMutex); // mutex is locked in constructor
    e = data.fetch();
  } // l1 destructor is called here, and the lock is unlocked
  // do processing of the element
  if (e.finished())
    return;
  { // scope B
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> l2(dataMutex); // mutex is locked in constructor
    data.append(std::move(e));
  } // l2 destructor is called here, and the mutex is unlocked
}
----

In the above example, scopes `A` and `B` limit the number of operations performed
in the critical section (when the mutex is acquired).
Removing all nested scopes would lead to deadlock, where `l2` will try to lock
`dataMutex`, already acquired in the same thread by the constructor of `l1`.
