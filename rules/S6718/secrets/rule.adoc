=== What is the potential impact?

Stripe endpoint secrets allow webhooks to verify that requests to a user-owned
webhook really originated from Stripe. This data can be used to transmit
thousands of different types of
https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types[sensitive events].

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

==== Breach of trust in non-repudiation and disruption of the audit trail

When such a secret is compromised, malicious actors can send malicious event
objects, causing discrepancies in the audit trail. This can make it difficult
to trace and verify the sequence of events, impacting the ability to
investigate and identify unauthorized or fraudulent activity.

All in all, this can lead to problems in proving the validity of transactions
or actions performed, potentially leading to disputes and legal complications.
