ASP.NET 1.1+ comes with a feature called _Request Validation_, preventing the server to accept content containing un-encoded HTML. This feature comes as a first protection layer against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and act as a simple Web Application Firewall (WAF) rejecting requests potentially containing malicious content.
While this feature is not a silver bullet to prevent all XSS attacks, it helps to catch basic ones. It will for example prevent `+<script type="text/javascript" src="https://malicious.domain/payload.js">+` to reach your Controller.

Note: _Request Validation_ feature being only available for ASP.NET, no Security Hotspot is raised on ASP.NET Core applications.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* the developer doesn't know the impact to deactivate the Request Validation feature
* the web application accepts user supplied data
* all user supplied data are not validated

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Activate the Request Validation feature for all HTTP requests


== Sensitive Code Example

At Controller level:

----
[ValidateInput(false)]
public ActionResult Welcome(string name)
{
  ...
}
----

At application level, configured in the Web.config file:

----
<configuration>
   <system.web>
      <pages validateRequest="false" />
      ...
      <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="0.0" />
   </system.web>
</configuration>
----


== Compliant Solution

At Controller level:

----
[ValidateInput(true)]
public ActionResult Welcome(string name)
{
  ...
}
or 
public ActionResult Welcome(string name)
{
  ...
}
----

At application level, configured in the Web.config file:

----
<configuration>
   <system.web>
      <pages validateRequest="true" />
      ...
      <!-- see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection.requestvalidationmode?view=netframework-4.8 -->
      <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="4.5" /> 
   </system.web>
</configuration>
----
