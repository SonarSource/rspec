== Why is this an issue?

Marking a non-public method `@Async` or `@Transactional` is misleading because, up to version 5, Spring does not recognize non-public methods, and so makes no provision for their proper invocation.
Nor does Spring make provision for the methods invoked by the method it called.
Since Spring 6, protected and package-private methods can be handled, but the issue remains for private methods.

Therefore, marking a private method, for instance, @Transactional gives a false sense of security, and can lead to incorrect assumptions and potential bugs.

== Exceptions

The rule targets all non-public methods for project using Spring up to Spring 5, but only private methods for Spring 6 because Spring 6 takes into account all non-private methods.

== How to fix it

Declare the method `public`.
Note that this action alone does not resolve the issue of direct instance calls from within the same class (see rule S6809), but it is a required precondition to fix it.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Async
private Future<String> asyncMethodWithReturnType() { // Noncompliant, no proxy generated and
    return "Hellow, world!";                         // can only be invoked from same class
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Async
public Future<String> asyncMethodWithReturnType() { // Compliant
    return "Hellow, world!";
}
----

Two questions/remarks:

* Are we talking about private methods or about non-public methods ? If my feeling is correct this rule should only target private methods
* I would tag the rule with the label "spring"
* As this rule is associated to the Reliability characteristic, I think the default severity should be "Critical"

The Spring docs are pretty clear that only `public` method can actually be `@Transactional`

Ok Ann, so I would replace :


"Therefore marking a private method"


by


"Therefore marking for instance a private method"


to prevent any misunderstanding

\[~ann.campbell.2] Actually, any method can be Transactional if you're using AspectJ compiler, it's stated in the docs https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html[here]. The excerpt:


----
Method visibility and @Transactional

When using proxies, you should apply the @Transactional annotation only to methods with public visibility. If you do annotate protected, private or package-visible methods with the @Transactional annotation, no error is raised, but the annotated method does not exhibit the configured transactional settings. Consider the use of AspectJ (see below) if you need to annotate non-public methods.
