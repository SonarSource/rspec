== Why is this an issue?

Marking a non-public method ``++@Transactional++`` is both useless and misleading because Spring doesn't "see" non-``++public++`` methods, and so makes no provision for their proper invocation. Nor does Spring make provision for the methods invoked by the method it called.


Therefore marking a ``++private++``  method, for instance, ``++@Transactional++`` can only result in a runtime error or exception if the method is actually written to be ``++@Transactional++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
@Transactional  // Noncompliant
private void doTheThing(ArgClass arg) {
  // ...
