== Why is this an issue?

The `void` operator evaluates its argument and always returns `undefined`. `void` allows using any expression where an `undefined` is expected. However, using `void` makes code more difficult to understand, as the intent is often unclear. 

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (parameter === void 42) { // Noncompliant
   // ...
}
doSomethingElse(void doSomething()); // Noncompliant
----

Instead of using `void` to get the `undefined` value, use the `undefined` global property. In ECMAScript5 and newer environments, `undefined` cannot be reassigned. In other cases, remove the `void` operator to avoid confusion for maintainers.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (parameter === undefined) {
   // ...
}
doSomething();
doSomethingElse();
----


=== Exceptions

* `void 0` (or the equivalent `void(0)`) is allowed as it was a conventional way to obtain the `undefined` value in environments before ECMAScript 5.

[source,javascript]
----
if (parameter === void 0) {
   // ...
}
----

* `void` is allowed with immediately invoked function expressions.

[source,javascript]
----
void function() {
   // ...
}();
----

* `void` is allowed with Promise-like objects to mark a promise as intentionally not awaited, as advised by https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-floating-promises.md[@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises].

[source,javascript]
----
const runPromise = () => Promise.resolve();
void runPromise();
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] Hi! we added exclusion to this rule: ``++void 0++`` used as ``++undefined++``. Could you update main part of description, as it's outdated now. Thanks!
