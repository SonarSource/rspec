== Why is this an issue?

The `void` operator evaluates its argument and always returns `undefined`. `void` operator allows using any expression in the places where an `undefined` is expected. However, using `void` makes code more difficult to understand, as the intent is often not clear. 

[source,javascript]
----
void doSomething();  // Noncomplaint
----

In ECMAScript5 and newer environments, the global property `undefined` cannot be reassigned, so using `void` for this reason should also be avoided. 

[source,javascript]
----
undefined = 'Hello, world!'; // since ECMAScript5, this statement has no effect
if (parameter === void 42) { // Noncompliant
   // ...
}
----

=== Exceptions

* In environments before ECMAScript 5, `void 0` was a conventional way to obtain the `undefined` value, so it's still accepted by the rule.

[source,javascript]
----
if (parameter === void 0) { // Compliant
   // ...
}
----

* `void` is also allowed with immediately invoked function expressions, as otherwise parsing would fail.

[source,javascript]
----
void function() { // Compliant
   // ...
}();
----

* `void` is allowed with Promise-like objects.

[source,javascript]
----
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve(42));
void promise;
----

== How to fix it

When using `void ...` to get the `undefined` value, directly use the `undefined` identifier instead.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (parameter === void 42) { // Noncompliant
   // ...
}
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (parameter === undefined) {
   // ...
}
----

Otherwise, the `void` operator should be removed to avoid confusion for maintainers.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,javascript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
doSomethingElse(void doSomething()); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,javascript,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
doSomething();
doSomethingElse();
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] Hi! we added exclusion to this rule: ``++void 0++`` used as ``++undefined++``. Could you update main part of description, as it's outdated now. Thanks!
