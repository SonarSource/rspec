The ``++void++`` operator evaluates its argument and unconditionally returns ``++undefined++``. It can be useful in pre-ECMAScript 5 environments, where ``++undefined++`` could be reassigned, but generally, its use makes code harder to understand.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,javascript]
----
void doSomething();
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,javascript]
----
doSomething();
----


== Exceptions

No issue is raised when ``++void 0++`` is used in place of ``++undefined++``. 

----
if (parameter === void 0) {...}
----

No issue is raised when ``++void++`` is used before immediately invoked function expressions.

----
void (function() {
   ...
}());
----

No issue is raised when ``++void++``'s argument is a promise.

----
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('done');
   }, 3000);
});
void promise;
