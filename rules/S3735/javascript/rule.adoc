== Why is this an issue?

The `void` operator evaluates its argument and always returns `undefined`. However, using `void` makes code more difficult to understand because it is not always clear the intent is to return the value `undefined`. 

The below code sample will always return `undefined`.

[source,javascript]
----
void doSomething();  //noncomplaint
----

In ES5 and newer environments the global property undefined cannot be redefined, so using void is no longer necessary. 

[source,javascript]
----
doSomething();
----

=== Exceptions

Before ES5 it was possible to reassign the global value of `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

In pre-ES5 environments, `void 0` was used as an alias for `undefined` because it evaluates 0 and returns `undefined`.

[source,javascript]
----
if (parameter === void 0) {...}
----

When `void` is used before immediately invoked function expressions, `undefined` is always returned.

[source,javascript]
----
void (function() {
   ...
}());
----

In the last line of this code sample, the promise object is discarded by using the `void` operator. 

[source,javascript]
----
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('done');
   }, 3000);
});
void promise;

\[~ann.campbell.2] Hi! we added exclusion to this rule: ``++void 0++`` used as ``++undefined++``. Could you update main part of description, as it's outdated now. Thanks!
