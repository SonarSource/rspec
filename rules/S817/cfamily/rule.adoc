== Why is this an issue?

Concatenation of wide and narrow string literals has not always been supported in C or {cpp}, and even when supported, the meaning may be unclear to the reader. Furthermore, concatenation of string literals with different encodings was only conditionally supported prior to {cpp}23, and is now explicitly ill-formed as of {cpp}23.

Therefore, only string literals with the same prefix should be concatenated together.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
wchar_t n_array[] = "Hello" L"World";     // Noncompliant
wchar_t w_array[] = L"Hello" "World";     // Noncompliant
auto u8_array = "Hello" u8"World";        // Noncompliant
auto u_array = u"Hello" "World";          // Noncompliant

// Mixed encoding prefixes (ill-formed as of C++23)
auto mixed1 = L"Hello" u8"World";         // Noncompliant
auto mixed2 = u"Hello" U"World";          // Noncompliant
auto mixed3 = u8"Hello" u"World";         // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
char n_array[] = "Hello" "World";         // Compliant
wchar_t w_array[] = L"Hello" L"World";    // Compliant
auto u8_array = u8"Hello" u8"World";      // Compliant
auto u_array = u"Hello" u"World";         // Compliant

Previous description mentioned undefined behaviour, but this was no longer the case, in C and in {cpp}.
