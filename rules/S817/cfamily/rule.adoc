== Why is this an issue?

Concatenation of wide and narrow string literals has not always been supported in C or {cpp}, and even when supported, the meaning may be unclear to the reader. Concatenation of string literals with different encodings is only conditionally supported, and may be removed in a future version of the language.


Therefore, only string literals with the same prefix should be concatenated together.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
wchar_t n_array[] = "Hello" L"World";     // Noncompliant
wchar_t w_array[] = L"Hello" "World";     // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
char_t n_array[] = "Hello" "World";     // Compliant
wchar_t w_array[] = L"Hello" L"World";	// Compliant
----

Previous description mentioned undefined behaviour, but this was no longer the case, in C and in {cpp}.
