== Why is this an issue?

While it is technically correct to assign to parameters from within function bodies, doing so before the parameter value is read is likely a bug. Instead, initial values of parameters should be, if not treated as read-only, then at least read before reassignment.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
function foo($str, $array) {
  $str = "name; // Noncompliant

  foreach ($array as $item) {
    $item = "hello world";  // Noncompliant
  }
}
