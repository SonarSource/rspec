While it is technically correct to assign to parameters from within function bodies, it reduces code readability because developers won't be able to tell whether the original parameter or some temporary variable is being accessed without going through the whole function. Moreover, some developers might also expect assignments of function parameters to be visible to callers, which is not the case, and this lack of visibility could confuse them. Instead, all parameters, caught exceptions, and foreach parameters should be treated as constants.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function MyClass(name, strings) {
  name = foo;                    // Noncompliant

  for (var str of strings) {
    str = "";  // Noncompliant
  }
}
