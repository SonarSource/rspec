== Why is this an issue?

Serialization event handlers that don't have the correct signature will not be called, bypassing augmentations to automated serialization and deserialization events.

A method is designated a serialization event handler by applying one of the following serialization event attributes:

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.onserializingattribute[`OnSerializingAttribute`]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.onserializedattribute[`OnSerializedAttribute`]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.ondeserializingattribute[`OnDeserializingAttribute`]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.ondeserializedattribute[`OnDeserializedAttribute`]

Serialization event handlers take a single parameter of type https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.streamingcontext[`StreamingContext`], return `void`, and have `private` visibility.

This rule raises an issue when any of these constraints are not respected.
