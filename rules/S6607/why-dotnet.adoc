== Why is this an issue?

When working with LINQ in C#, it is recommended to pay attention to the order in which methods are chained, especially when using `Where` and `OrderBy` methods. 
It is advised to call the `Where` method before `OrderBy` because `Where` filters the elements of the sequence based on a given condition and returns a new sequence containing only the elements that satisfy that condition. 
Calling `OrderBy` before `Where`, may end up sorting elements that will be later discarded, which can lead to inefficiency. 
Conversely, calling `Where` before `OrderBy`, will first filter the sequence to include only the elements of interest, and then sort them based on the specified order.
