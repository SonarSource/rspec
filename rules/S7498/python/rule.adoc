This rule raises an issue when `dict()`, `list()`, or `tuple()` are used to create empty collections or to initialize dictionaries with keyword arguments. 

== Why is this an issue?

Python provides concise literal syntax for creating empty dictionaries (`{}`), lists (`[]`), and tuples (`()`). 
It also offers a direct literal syntax for initializing dictionaries with key-value pairs (e.g., `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`).

Using the function calls `dict()`, `list()`, and `tuple()` for these purposes is generally less preferred for a few reasons:
* Performance: Calling a function involves overhead, including name lookup for `dict`, `list`, or `tuple` in the current scope. 
While often negligible for single calls, using literals is a direct instruction to the interpreter and can be marginally faster, especially in performance-sensitive code or tight loops.
* Readability and Directness: Literals are often considered more "Pythonic" and directly express the intent of creating an empty container or a dictionary with specific initial values. 
* Consistency: Python encourages the use of literals where they are clear and effective.

Specifically, the following patterns are discouraged:
* Using `dict()` to create an empty dictionary instead of `{}`.
* Using `list()` to create an empty list instead of `[]`.
* Using `tuple()` to create an empty tuple instead of `()`.
* Using `dict(key='value', ...)` to initialize a dictionary instead of `{'key': 'value', ...}` when keys are simple strings valid as identifiers.

While the functional difference is minimal for creating empty collections or simple dictionaries, adopting literals promotes a more direct and idiomatic coding style.

== How to fix it

To fix this replace the function calls `dict()`, `list()`, and `tuple()` with their equivalent literal syntax.

* To create an empty dictionary, replace `dict()` with `{}`.
* To create an empty list, replace `list()` with `[]`.
* To create an empty tuple, replace `tuple()` with `()`.
* To initialize a dictionary with keyword arguments (where keys are simple strings that are valid identifiers), replace `dict(key1=value1, key2=value2)` with `{'key1': value1, 'key2': value2}`.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)
=== Message
Replace this constructor call with a literal.

=== Highlighting
The list/set/dict constructor call.

=== Quickfix

Is straightforward, as we can replace the list with `[]`.
