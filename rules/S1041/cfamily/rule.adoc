== Why is this an issue?

If a program throws an unhandled exception it terminates in an implementation-defined manner. In particular, it is implementation-defined whether the call stack is unwound before termination, so the destructors of any automatic objects may or may not be executed. By enforcing the provision of a “last-ditch catch-all”, the developer can ensure that the program terminates in a consistent manner.


The possible exceptions from a program should be caught as a matter of course. This rule’s objective is to ensure that exceptions that were _not_ expected are also caught.


=== Compliant solution

For the majority of programs this will mean ``++main++`` should look like:

[source,cpp]
----
int32_t main( )
{
  try
  {
    // program code
  }
  catch ( ... ) // Catch-all handler
  {
    // Handle unexpected exceptions
  }
  return 0;
}
----

Add a "catch ( ... )" handler to catch the possibly thrown exceptions.
