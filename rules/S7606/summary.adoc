Cross-App Scripting is a variant of XSS that targets mobile applications using a WebView to display web content. It happens if the application accepts data from another, potentially malicious, application on the same device and passes it into its WebView without proper validation. 

An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious application that sends specially prepared data to the vulnerable app. The vulnerability is triggered when the application passes theattacker's malicious data to one of the WebView methods that executes HTML or JavaScript.
