=== What is the potential impact?

==== Theft of Sensitive Information

JavaScript that runs inside a WebView can read the contents of the page being displayed. 
If the WebView shows private user details, such as personal information, financial data, 
or confidential documents, a malicious script can copy this data and send it to an attacker.

The script can also access session information, like cookies or authentication tokens. 
These tokens are what keep a user logged into your service. Stealing them is like stealing 
a temporary key to a user's account.

==== Account Takeover

If an attacker obtains a user's session token, they can often impersonate that user. 
The attacker can use the stolen token to access the user's account from their own device 
without needing the user's password. Once inside, they could have full access to the account,
allowing them to view private data, change account settings, or lock the original user out.

==== Displaying Deceptive Content

An attackerâ€™s script can change the content and appearance of the page shown in the WebView.
For example, the script could display a fake login screen that looks identical to your app's real one.
If a user enters their username and password into this fake form, the script sends the credentials
to the attacker. This technique is a form of phishing.

==== Performing Unauthorized Actions

Some applications set up a bridge that allows JavaScript in a WebView to communicate with the
native part of the Android application. If this is the case, a malicious script could potentially
use this bridge to perform actions on behalf of the user. Depending on your app's features,
this could include sending messages, modifying files, or accessing contacts.
