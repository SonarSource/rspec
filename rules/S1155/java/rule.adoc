== Why is this an issue?

When you call `isEmpty()`, it clearly communicates the code's intention, which is to check if the collection is empty. Using `size() == 0` for this purpose is less direct and makes the code slightly more complex.

Moreover, depending on the implementation, the `size()` method can have a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the collection. On the other hand, `isEmpty()` simply checks if there is at least one element in the collection, which is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyClass {
  public void doSomething(Collection<String> myCollection) {
    if (myCollection.size() == 0) { // Noncompliant
      doSomethingElse();
    }
  }
}
----

Prefer using `isEmpty()` to test for emptiness over `size()`.
