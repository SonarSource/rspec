== Why is this an issue?

When you call `empty()` or `is_empty()`, it clearly communicates the code's intention, which is to check if the collection is empty. Using `size() == 0` for this purpose is less direct and makes the code slightly more complex.

Moreover, depending on the implementation, the `size()`, `length()`, or `count()` methods can have a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the collection. On the other hand, `empty()` and `is_empty()` simply check if there is at least one element in the collection, which is a constant time operation, `O(1)`. Note that only `empty()` is part of the standard library, but we report on methods with similar names.

Prefer using `empty()` or `is_empty()` to test for emptiness over `size()`, `length()`, or `count()`.
