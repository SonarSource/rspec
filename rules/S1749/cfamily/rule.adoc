== Why is this an issue?

Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that type specifiers always appear in the following order:

. ``++typedef++``
. type name, spelling of built-in types with more than one type-specifier:
.. signedness - ``++signed++`` or ``++unsigned++``
.. last single type-specifier or
*** ``++short int++``
*** ``++long int++``
*** ``++long long int++``
*** ``++long double++``

Since the positioning of the ``++const++`` keyword is controversial, this rule does not check it.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int typedef T;

double long d;
char unsigned ch;
long signed int i;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
typedef int T;

long double d;
unsigned char ch;
signed long int i;
----
