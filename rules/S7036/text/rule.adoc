Clean code should not make use of offensive language but instead use neutral and inclusive terminology.

== Why is this an issue?

Code is meant to be understandable and clear to the reader.
Discriminatory and offensive language is often used for expressiveness.
Such language has made its way into technical jargon
and code despite being derived from specific cultural contexts that carry discriminatory connotations.
These terms are often idiomatic expressions that can be misleading
and using such terms can perpetuate negative biases and hinder effective communication.

For instance, the term sanity check is derived from psychiatric sanity,
which can have a negative connotation with respect to a person’s mental health.
Code itself cannot be in a state of sanity or, conversely, insanity.
In the context of code, more precise and descriptive alternatives,
such as validation check or verification check, exist and provide a clearer meaning.
By choosing unambiguous and neutral terminology, we promote inclusivity and reduce the ambiguity of code.

Companies with a mandate for inclusivity need to build products for everyone with the following considerations:

* *Brand reputation*:
  ** The adoption of respectful language in code aligns with evolving industry standards to position a brand as a leader in innovation and professionalism and avoid reputational damage and backlash.
  ** Example: https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/04/05/1175/facebook-algorithm-discriminates-ai-bias/[Facebook’s ad-serving algorithm discriminates by gender and race | MIT Technology Review]

* *Employee Relations*:
  ** Respectful and inclusive language in code reflects a respectful and inclusive workplace culture.
  ** Clear language in code fosters better understanding and communication among team members.

* *Legal/Regulatory Compliance*:
  ** Compliance with legal requirements and industry regulations.
  ** Neutral and inclusive terminology minimizes the risk of litigation.
