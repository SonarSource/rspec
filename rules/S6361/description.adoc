``++android:permission++`` is used to set a single permission for both reading and writing data from a content provider.
In regard to the Principle of Least Privilege, client applications that consume the content provider should only have the necessary privileges to complete their tasks. As ``++android:permission++`` grants both read and write access, it prevents client applications from applying this principle.
In practice, it means client applications that require read-only access will have to ask for more privileges than what they need: the content provider will always grant read and write together.
