\[~evgeny.mandrikov] given the fact that it's only a compiler warning to have a ``++virtual++`` function in a derived class with a mismatched signature, do we want a rule on that?


E.G. 

----
class BaseClass
{
    virtual void doTheThing() const;
}

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass
{
    virtual void doTheThing();
}
