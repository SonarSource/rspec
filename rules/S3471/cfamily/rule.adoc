== Why is this an issue?

In a base class, ``++virtual++`` indicates that a function can be overridden. In a derived class, it indicates an override. But given the specifier's dual meaning, it would be both clearer and more sound to use derived class-specific specifiers instead: ``++override++`` or ``++final++``.


* ``++final++`` indicates a function ``++override++`` that cannot itself be overridden. The compiler will issue a warning if the signature does not match the signature of a base-class ``++virtual++`` function.
* ``++override++`` indicates that a function is intended to override a base-class function. The compiler will issue a warning if this is not the case. It is redundant in combination with ``++final++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class Counter {
protected:
  int c = 0;
public:
  virtual void count() {
    c++;
  }
};

class FastCounter: public Counter {
public:
  virtual void count() {  // Noncompliant
    c += 2;
  }
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class Counter {
protected:
  int c = 0;
public:
  virtual void count() {
    c++;
  }
};

class FastCounter: public Counter {
public:
  void count() override {
    c += 2;
  }
};
----
or

[source,cpp]
----
class Counter {
protected:
  int c = 0;
public:
  virtual void count() {
    c++;
  }
};

class FastCounter: public Counter {
public:
  void count() final {
    c += 2;
  }
};
