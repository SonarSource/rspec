== Why is this an issue?

In a base class, ``++virtual++`` indicates that a function can be overridden. In a derived class, it indicates an override. But given the specifier's dual meaning, it would be both clearer and more sound to use derived class-specific specifiers instead: ``++override++`` or ``++final++``.

[source,cpp]
----
class Counter {
protected:
  int c = 0;
public:
  virtual void count() {
    c++;
  }
};

class FastCounter: public Counter {
public:
  virtual void count() {  // Noncompliant: ambiguous
    c += 2;
  }
};
----

* ``++override++`` indicates that a function is intended to override a base-class function. The compiler will issue a warning if this is not the case.


[source,cpp]
----
class FastCounter: public Counter {
public:
  void count() override {
    c += 2;
  }
};
----

* ``++final++`` indicates a function ``++override++`` that cannot itself be overridden. The compiler will issue a warning if the signature does not match the signature of a base-class ``++virtual++`` function. `override` is redundant when `final` is specified.

[source,cpp]
----
class FastCounter: public Counter {
public:
  void count() final {
    c += 2;
  }
};

=== Message

* Annotate this function with "override" or "final".
* Use "override" or "final" instead of "virtual".
* Drop the "[virtual|override]" specifier; it is redundant.
* Drop the "virtual" and "override" specifiers; they are redundant.

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] given the fact that it's only a compiler warning to have a ``++virtual++`` function in a derived class with a mismatched signature, do we want a rule on that?


E.G. 

----
class BaseClass
{
    virtual void doTheThing() const;
}

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass
{
    virtual void doTheThing();
}

Hi [~ann.campbell.2], that's a pretty good idea to have a dedicated rule for that which would be activated by default. You can go ahead.
