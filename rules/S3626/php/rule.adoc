== Why is this an issue?

Jump statements, such as ``++return++``, ``++goto++``, and ``++continue++`` let you change the default flow of program execution, but jump statements that direct the control flow to the original direction are just a waste of keystrokes.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
function foo($p) {
  $i = $p;
  while ($i > 0) {
    $i--;
    continue; // Noncompliant
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
function foo($p) {
  $i = $p;
  while ($i > 0) {
    $i--;
  }
}
