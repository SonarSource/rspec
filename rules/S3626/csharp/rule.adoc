== Why is this an issue?

Jump statements, such as `return`, `yield break`, `goto`, and `continue` are used to change the normal flow of execution in a program. However, redundant jump statements can make code difficult to read and maintain.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
void Foo()
{
  goto A; // Noncompliant
  A:
  while (condition1)
  {
    if (condition2)
    {
      continue; // Noncompliant
    }
    else
    {
      DoTheThing();
    }
  }
  return; // Noncompliant; this is a void method
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
void Foo()
{
  while (condition1)
  {
    if (!condition2)
    {
      DoTheThing();
    }
  }
}
----

=== Exceptions

* `return` statements followed by a local function declaration are not considered redundant, as they help with readability.
