Jump statements, such as ``++return++``, ``++break++`` and ``++continue++`` let you change the default flow of program execution, but jump statements that direct the control flow to the original direction are just a waste of keystrokes.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function redundantJump(x) {
  if (x == 1) {
    console.log("x == 1");
    return; // Noncompliant
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
function redundantJump(x) {
  if (x == 1) {
    console.log("x == 1");
  }
}
----

== Exceptions

``++break++`` and ``++return++`` inside ``++switch++`` statement are ignored, because they are often used for consistency. ``++continue++`` with label is also ignored, because label is usually used for clarity. Also a jump statement being a single statement in a block is ignored.
