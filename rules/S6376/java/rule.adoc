XML parsers Denial of Service attacks target XML parsers, which are software components responsible for parsing and interpreting XML documents.

== Why is this an issue?

XML files are complex data structures. When a malicious user is able to submit an XML file, it triggers complex processing that may overwhelm the parser. Most of the time, those complex processing are enabled by default, and XML parsers do not take preventive measures against Denial of Service attacks.

=== What is the potential impact?

When an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability, it can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

=== System Unavailability

Affected system becomes unresponsive or crashes, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. This can have severe consequences, especially for critical systems that rely on continuous availability, such as web servers, APIs, or network services.

=== Amplification Attacks

In some cases, XML parsers Denial of Service attacks can be used as a part of larger-scale amplification attacks. By leveraging the vulnerability, attackers can generate a disproportionately large response from the targeted system, amplifying the impact of their attack. This can result in overwhelming network bandwidth and causing widespread disruption.

Quick fixes (for Java): even if it is technically possible to provide a fix that would result in compliant code, it does not sound wise to set properties blindly, as it can have side effects. Fixing the issue requires a careful and good understanding of the overall context of the code.
