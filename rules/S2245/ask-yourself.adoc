== Ask Yourself Whether

* the code using the generated value requires it to be unpredictable. It is the case for all encryption mechanisms or when a secret value, such as a password, is hashed.
* the function you use generates a value which can be predicted (pseudo-random).
* the generated value is used multiple times.
* an attacker can access the generated value.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.
