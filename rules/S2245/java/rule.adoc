Using pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6386[CVE-2013-6386]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3419[CVE-2006-3419]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4102[CVE-2008-4102]

When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.


As the ``++java.util.Random++`` class relies on a pseudorandom number generator, this class and relating ``++java.lang.Math.random()++`` method should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, the ``++java.security.SecureRandom++`` class which relies on a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) should be used in place.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) like "java.security.SecureRandom" in place of this PRNG.
* Use the generated random values only once.
* You should not expose the generated random value. If you have to store it, make sure that the database or file is secure.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
Random random = new Random(); // Sensitive use of Random
byte bytes[] = new byte[20];
random.nextBytes(bytes); // Check if bytes is used for hashing, encryption, etc...
----

== Compliant Solution

----
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); // Compliant for security-sensitive use cases
byte bytes[] = new byte[20];
random.nextBytes(bytes);
----
