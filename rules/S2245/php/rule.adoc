Using pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6386[CVE-2013-6386]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3419[CVE-2006-3419]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4102[CVE-2008-4102]

When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

As the ``++rand()++`` and ``++mt_rand()++`` functions rely on a pseudorandom number generator, it should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use functions which rely on a cryptographically strong random number generator such as ``++random_int()++`` or ``++random_bytes()++`` or ``++openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()++``
* When using ``++openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()++``, provide and check the ``++crypto_strong++`` parameter
* Use the generated random values only once.
* You should not expose the generated random value. If you have to store it, make sure that the database or file is secure.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
$random = rand();
$random2 = mt_rand(0, 99);
----

== Compliant Solution

----
$randomInt = random_int(0,99); // Compliant; generates a cryptographically secure random integer
----
