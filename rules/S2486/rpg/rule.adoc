== Why is this an issue?

Leaving an ``++ON-ERROR++`` block empty means that the exception in question is neither handled nor passed forward to callers for handling at a higher level. Suppressing errors rather than handling them could lead to unpredictable system behavior and should be avoided.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,rpg]
----
      /free
        monitor;
          // ...
          on-error *FILE; // Noncompliant
        endmon;
      /end-free
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,rpg]
----
      /free
        monitor;
          // ...
          on-error *FILE;
            handleFileError();
        endmon;
      /end-free
----

=== Exceptions

When a block contains a comment, it is not considered to be empty.
