This rule raises an issue when methods in an Apex class are not separated by exactly one blank line.

== Why is this an issue?

Consistent spacing between methods is essential for code readability and maintainability. When methods are placed directly next to each other without any separation, the code becomes harder to scan and understand quickly. Developers need visual breaks to distinguish where one method ends and another begins.

Proper spacing creates a clear visual hierarchy in your code. It helps developers:

* Quickly identify method boundaries
* Navigate through the codebase more efficiently
* Maintain focus when reading or debugging specific methods
* Follow consistent formatting standards across the team

On the other hand, using too many blank lines between methods creates unnecessary vertical space that forces developers to scroll more, reducing the amount of code visible on screen at once.

The standard practice in Apex development is to use exactly one blank line between methods. This provides sufficient visual separation without wasting screen space, making the code both readable and compact.

=== What is the potential impact?

Poor method spacing reduces code readability and makes navigation more difficult for developers. While this doesn't affect functionality, it can slow down development and code review processes, especially in larger codebases where consistent formatting is crucial for team productivity.

== How to fix it

Add exactly one blank line between methods. Remove any extra blank lines if there are more than one, or add a blank line if methods are directly adjacent.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyClass {
    public void method1() {
        // code here
    }
    public void method2() { // Noncompliant
        // code here
    }


    public void method3() { // Noncompliant
        // code here
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyClass {
    public void method1() {
        // code here
    }

    public void method2() {
        // code here
    }

    public void method3() {
        // code here
    }
}
