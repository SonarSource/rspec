Also, I'm confused by this part of the Noncompliant example:

----
void report() {
  printColor(Color::Red);       // correct
  printColor(ProductType::Big); // clearly buggy
  printInt(Color::Red);         // conversion is implicit
}
----

I thought part of the point was that plain ``++enum++``s don't require the scope resolution operator...?
