The Java Persistence API specification imposes only a conditional requirement that ``++@Entity++`` classes be ``++Serializable++``:

____
If an entity instance is to be passed by value as a detached object (e.g., through a remote interface), the entity class must implement the ``++Serializable++`` interface.
____


But it's best practice to make all such classes ``++Serializable++`` from the start. So this rule raises an issue when an ``++@Entity++`` does not implement ``++Serializable++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
@Entity
pubic class Person {  // Noncompliant
  private String fname;
  // ...
----


== Compliant Solution

----
@Entity
pubic class Person implements Serializable {
  private String fname;
  // ...
----
