== Sensitive Code Example

Server-side encryption is not used:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,"MyUnencryptedBucket",
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.UNENCRYPTED       # Sensitive
)
----
The default value of `encryption` is `KMS` if `encryptionKey` is set. Otherwise, if both parameter are absent the bucket is unencrypted.

== Compliant Solution

Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys is used:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,"MyEncryptedBucket",
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED       # Compliant
)

# Alternatively with a KMS key managed by the user.

bucket = s3.Bucket(self,"MyEncryptedBucket",
    encryptionKey=access_key                        # Compliant
)
----
