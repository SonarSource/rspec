== Sensitive Code Example

Server-side encryption is not used:

[source,javascript]
----
const s3 = require('aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3');

new s3.Bucket(this, 'id', {
    bucketName: 'default'
}); // Sensitive
----
Bucket encryption is disabled by default.

== Compliant solution

Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys is used:

[source,javascript]
----
const s3 = require('aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3');

new s3.Bucket(this, 'id', {
    encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED
});

# Alternatively with a KMS key managed by the user.

new s3.Bucket(this, 'id', {
    encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED,
    encryptionKey: access_key
});
----
