== Why is this an issue?
When declaring a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0[`OperationContract`] method as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute.isoneway?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0[`one-way`], that service method won't return any result, not even an underlying empty confirmation message. These are fire-and-forget methods that are useful in event-like communication. Therefore, specifying a return type has no effect and can confuse readers.
