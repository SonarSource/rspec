=== What is the potential impact?

SSH private keys are used for authentication and secure communication in SSH
(Secure Shell) protocols. They are a form of asymmetric cryptography, where a
pair of keys is generated: a private key and a corresponding public key.
SSH keys provide a secure and efficient way to authenticate and establish secure
connections between clients and servers. They are widely used for remote login,
file transfer, and secure remote administration.

When an SSH private key is leaked to an unintended audience, it can have severe
consequences for security and confidentiality. One of the primary outcomes is
unauthorized access. The unintended audience can exploit the leaked private key
to authenticate themselves as the legitimate owner, gaining unauthorized entry
to systems, servers, or accounts that accept the key for authentication. This
unauthorized access opens the door for various malicious activities, including
data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and misuse of sensitive information.
