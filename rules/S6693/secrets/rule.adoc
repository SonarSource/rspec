=== What is the potential impact?

SSH private keys are used for authentication and secure communication in SSH
(Secure Shell) protocols. They are a form of asymmetric cryptography, where a
pair of keys is generated: a private key and a corresponding public key.
SSH keys provide a secure and efficient way to authenticate and establish secure
connections between clients and servers. They are widely used for remote login,
file transfer, and secure remote administration.

When an SSH private key is leaked to an unintended audience, it can have severe
consequences for security and confidentiality. One of the primary outcomes is
unauthorized access. The unintended audience can exploit the leaked private key
to authenticate themselves as the legitimate owner, gaining unauthorized entry
to systems, servers, or accounts that accept the key for authentication. This
unauthorized access opens the door for various malicious activities, including
data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and misuse of sensitive information.

Another significant consequence is the compromise of systems. If the leaked
private key is used to gain access to a system, the attacker can potentially
compromise the entire system. This can involve installing malware, stealing
data, modifying configurations, or escalating privileges, depending on the level
of access obtained. Such compromises severely impact the integrity,
availability, and confidentiality of the system and its resources.

Identity theft is also a significant risk when an SSH private key is leaked.
With access to the private key, an attacker can impersonate the legitimate
owner, leading to various detrimental outcomes. This can include reputational
damage, financial loss, or even legal consequences. The attacker can perform
actions on behalf of the owner, potentially engaging in identity theft,
fraudulent activities, or unauthorized transactions.
