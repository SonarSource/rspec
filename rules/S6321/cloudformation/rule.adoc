== Why is this an issue?

Cloud platforms such as AWS support virtual firewalls that can be used to restrict access to services by controlling inbound and outbound traffic. +
Any firewall rule allowing traffic from all IP addresses to standard network ports on which administration services traditionally listen, such as 22 for SSH, can expose these services to exploits and unauthorized access.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
MySecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: "noncompliant"
      VpcId: !Ref myVPC
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22 # SSH traffic
          CidrIp: "0.0.0.0/0" # from all IP addresses is authorized
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
MySecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: "compliant"
      VpcId: !Ref myVPC
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: "1.2.3.0/24"
