When a call to `allow_from_any_ipv4` or `allow_default_port_from_any_ipv4` is identified:
* Change this method for `allow_from` and set `other` to a subset of trusted IP addresses

In any other case, when a dangerous peer definition is identified:
* Change this IP range to a subset of trusted IP addresses.
