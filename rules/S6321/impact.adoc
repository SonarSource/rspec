=== What is the potential impact?

Like any other service, administration services can contain vulnerabilities.
Administration services run with elevated privileges and thus a vulnerability
could have a high impact on the system.

Additionally, credentials might be leaked through phishing or similar techniques.
Attackers who are able to reach the services could use the credentials to log
in to the system.
