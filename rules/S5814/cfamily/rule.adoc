In C, a string is just a buffer of characters, normally using the ``++null++`` character as a sentinel for the end of the string. This means that the developer has to be aware of low-level details such as buffer sizes or having an extra character to store the final ``++null++`` character. Doing that correctly and consistently is notoriously difficult and any error can lead to a security vulnerability, for instance, giving access to sensitive data or allowing arbitrary code execution.


The function ``++char *strcat( char *restrict dest, const char *restrict src );++`` appends the characters of string ``++src++`` at the end of ``++dest++``. The ``++wcscat++`` does the same for wide characters and should be used with the same guidelines.


Note: the functions ``++strncat++`` and ``++wcsncat++`` might look like attractive safe replacements for ``++strcat++`` and ``++wcscaty++``, but they have their own set of issues (see S5815), and you should probably prefer another more adapted alternative.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* There is a possibility that either the ``++src++`` or the ``++dest++`` pointer is ``++null++``
* The current string length of ``++dest++`` plus the current string length of ``++src++`` plus 1 (for the finalÂ ``++null++`` character) is larger than the size of the buffer pointer-to by ``++src++``
* There is a possibility that either string is not correctly ``++null++``-terminated

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* C11 provides, in its annex K, the ``++strcat_s++`` and the ``++wcscat_s++`` that were designed as safer alternatives to ``++strcat++`` and ``++wcscat++``. It's not recommended to use them in all circumstances, because they introduce a runtime overhead and require to write more code for error handling, but they perform checks that will limit the consequences of calling the function with bad arguments.
* Even if your compiler does not exactly support annex K, you probably have access to similar functions
* If you are writing {cpp} code, using ``++std::string++`` to manipulate strings is much simpler and less error-prone


== Sensitive Code Example

----
int f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strcpy(dest, "Result: ");
  strcat(dest, src); // Sensitive: might overflow
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
int f(char *src) {
  char result[] = "Result: ";
  char *dest = malloc(sizeof(result) + strlen(src)); // Not need of +1 for final 0 because sizeof will already count one 0
  strcpy(dest, result);
  strcat(dest, src); // Compliant: the buffer size was carefully crafted
  int r = doSomethingWith(dest);
  free(dest);
  return r;
}
----
