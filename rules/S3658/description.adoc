When the code under test in a unit test throws an exception, the test itself fails. Therefore, there is no need to surround the tested code with a ``++try++``-``++catch++`` structure to detect failure. Instead, you can simply move the exception type to the method signature. 

This rule raises an issue when there is a fail assertion inside a ``++catch++`` block.
