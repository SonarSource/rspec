== Why is this an issue?

When the code under test in a unit test throws an exception, the test itself fails. Therefore, there is no need to surround the tested code with a ``++try++``-``++catch++`` structure to detect failure. Instead, you can simply move the exception type to the method signature. 


This rule raises an issue when there is a fail assertion inside a ``++catch++`` block.


Supported frameworks:

* JUnit3
* JUnit4
* JUnit5
* Fest assert
* AssertJ

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testMethod() {
  try {
            // Some code
  } catch (MyException e) {
    Assert.fail(e.getMessage());  // Noncompliant
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testMethod() throws MyException {
    // Some code
}
