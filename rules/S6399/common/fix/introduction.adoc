In most cases, building XML strings with a direct concatenation of user input
is discouraged. While not always possible, a strong pattern-based validation can
help sanitize tainted inputs. Likewise, converting to a harmless type can
sometimes be a solution.

However, avoiding handling objects' properties as strings by directly
constructing Java objects should be the preferred way.
