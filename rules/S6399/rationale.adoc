XML injections occur when an application builds an XML-formatted string from
user input without prior validation or sanitation. In such a case, a tainted 
user-controlled value can tamper with the XML string content. Especially,
unexpected arbitrary elements and attributes can be inserted in the
corresponding XML description.

A malicious injection payload could, for example:

* Insert tags into the main XML document.
* Add attributes to an existing XML tag.
* Change the data value inside a tag.

A malicious user-supplied value can perform other modifications depending on
where and how the constructed data is later used.
