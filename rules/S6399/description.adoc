User-provided data, such as URL parameters, POST data payloads, or cookies, are tainted with user-controlled inputs. Therefore, they should always be considered untrusted.	 

XML injection occurs when user-controlled input is embedded into XML syntax. In such a scenario, an attacker can abuse the XML syntax and inject arbitrary XML elements. This can lead to cross-site scripting issues or denial-of-service attacks.

In addition, the application may parse the XML document with a weakly configured XML parser (namely, a parser with external entity support enabled).
In this case, an XML External Entity (XXE) injection would expose the application to sensitive file disclosure or server-side request forgeries (SSRF).

An attacker can also elevate privileges if the XML data is used for authentication.
