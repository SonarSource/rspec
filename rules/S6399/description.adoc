User-provided data, such as URL parameters, POST data payloads, or cookies, are tainted with user-controlled inputs. Therefore, they should always be considered untrusted.	 

An XML injection occurs when user-controlled inputs is embedded into XML syntax. In such a scenario, an attacker can break the XML syntax and inject arbitrary XML elements. This can lead to cross-site scripting issues or denial of service attacks. Furthermore, if the application parses the XML document using a weakly configured XML parser (namely, a parser with support for external entities enabled), this can lead to the disclosure of sensitive files or server-side request forgeries (SSRF) by means of an XML external entity (XXE) injection. An attacker can also elevate privileges if the XML data is used for authentication.
