This rule raises an issue when Angular output bindings (including aliases) are named "on" or start with "on".

== Why is this an issue?

Angular's official style guide recommends against naming output bindings with "on" or prefixing them with "on". This naming convention can be confusing because:

* Output names should describe what happened, not when it happened
* The "on" prefix is typically used for event handler methods, not for the events themselves
* Following consistent naming conventions makes code more readable and maintainable
* It aligns with Angular's built-in outputs like `click`, `change`, and `submit` rather than `onClick`, `onChange`, or `onSubmit`

For example, instead of naming an output `onUserLogin`, it should be named `userLogin` or `userLoggedIn` to clearly indicate that this is an event being emitted, not a handler for the event.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using "on" prefixed output names can lead to confusion about the purpose of the binding and makes the codebase inconsistent with Angular's recommended practices. This can reduce code readability and make it harder for team members to understand the component's API.

=== How to fix in Angular?

Remove the "on" prefix from output binding names. Choose descriptive names that indicate what event occurred.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component({
  outputs: ['onClick'] // Noncompliant
})
class MyComponent {
  @Output() onSubmit = new EventEmitter(); // Noncompliant
  
  userAction = output({ alias: 'onUserAction' }); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component({
  outputs: ['click']
})
class MyComponent {
  @Output() submit = new EventEmitter();
  
  userAction = output({ alias: 'userAction' });
}
----

For outputs named exactly "on", choose a more descriptive name that indicates the specific event.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component()
class MyComponent {
  @Output() on = new EventEmitter(); // Noncompliant
  
  on = output(); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component()
class MyComponent {
  @Output() toggle = new EventEmitter();
  
  toggle = output();
}
----
