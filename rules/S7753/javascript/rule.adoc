This rule flags when `Array.findIndex()` or `Array.findLastIndex()` is used with a simple equality comparison that could be replaced with the more direct `indexOf()` or `lastIndexOf()` methods.

== Why is this an issue?

The `findIndex()` and `findLastIndex()` methods are designed for complex search operations that require custom logic. When you only need to find the index of a specific value using strict equality comparison, these methods are unnecessarily complex.

Using `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` for simple equality searches offers several advantages:

* *Better performance*: These methods are optimized for equality comparisons and don't require function call overhead
* *Clearer intent*: The code directly expresses that you're looking for a specific value
* *Simpler syntax*: No callback function is needed, reducing code complexity
* *Better readability*: Other developers can immediately understand the search operation

The `findIndex()` and `findLastIndex()` methods should be reserved for cases where you need custom comparison logic, use additional callback parameters (like index or array), or perform complex operations during the search.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `findIndex()` for simple equality searches creates unnecessary complexity and may impact performance. While the functional difference is minimal, the code becomes harder to read and maintain. In performance-critical applications, the overhead of callback function execution can accumulate over many operations.

=== How to fix?


Replace `findIndex()` with `indexOf()` when searching for a specific value using strict equality comparison.

const index = items.findIndex(x => x === 'target'); // Noncompliant
