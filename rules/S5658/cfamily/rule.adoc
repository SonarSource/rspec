== Why is this an issue?

Attempting to make a comparison between pointers using >, >=, < or +<=+ will produce undefined behavior if the two pointers point to different arrays.

Additionally, directly comparing two arrays for equality or inequality has been deprecated in {cpp}. 

However, equality or inequality between an array and a pointer is still valid


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f1 ( )
{
  int a1[ 10 ];
  int a2[ 10 ];
  int * p1 = a1;
  if ( p1 < a2 ) // Non-compliant, p1 and a2 point to different arrays.
  {
  }
  if ( p1 - a2 > 0 ) // Non-compliant, p1 and a2 point to different arrays.
  {
  }
  if ( a1 == a2) // Non-compliant (in C++). Comparing different array for equality is deprecated
  {
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f1 ( )
{
  int a1[ 10 ];
  int * p1 = a1;
  if ( p1 < a1 ) // Compliant, p1 and a1 point to the same array.
  {
  }
  if ( p1 - a1 > 0 )  // Compliant, p1 and a1 point to the same array.
  {
  }
  if ( p1 == a2 ) // Compliant, comparing a pointer and an array for equality is valid
  {
  }
}
