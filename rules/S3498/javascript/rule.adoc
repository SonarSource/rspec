When an already-defined variable is given the same name within a new object, object-shorthand syntax is preferred as being more compact. Similarly, object-shorthand is also preferred for the definition of functions in object literals.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
let a = 1;

let myObj = {
  a : a,  // Noncompliant
  fun: function () {  // Noncompliant
    //...
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
let a = 1;

let myObj = {
  a,
  fun () {
    //...
  }
}
