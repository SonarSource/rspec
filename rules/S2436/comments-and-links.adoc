\[~freddy.mallet] This is about Type parameters not parameters. 

\[~ann.campbell.2][~freddy.mallet] For me this is the same reasons as for RSPEC-107 : if you have too many type parameters then your class/method is probably doing too many things. 

Another reason to avoid too many type params is readability : 

----
<S, T, U, V> void foo() {} //not really readable
<String, Integer, Object, String>foo(); // especially on invocations
----
