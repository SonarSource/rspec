== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces two standard attributes to indicate the likelihood of a branch: ``\[[likely]]`` and ``\[[unlikely]]``.


These attributes replace the non-standard built-in ``++__builtin_expect++`` supported by Clang and GCC that was mostly used as part of ``++likely()++`` and ``++unlikely()++`` macros.


The standard annotations should always be preferred because they make the code portable and future-proof.


This rule reports the direct use of ``++__builtin_expect++`` built-in and its indirect use through ``++likely()++`` and ``++unlikely()++`` macros.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (likely(!v.empty())) { // Noncompliant
  std::cout <<v[0] <<'\n';
}

if (unlikely(nullptr == ptr)) { // Noncompliant
  std::cerr <<"Unexpected null pointer\n";
  exit(0);
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (!v.empty()) [[likely]] {
  std::cout <<v[0] <<'\n';
}

if (nullptr == ptr) [[unlikely]] {
  std::cerr <<"Unexpected null pointer\n";
  exit(0);
}
