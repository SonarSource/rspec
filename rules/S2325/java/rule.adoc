== Why is this an issue?

Non-overridable methods (``++private++`` or ``++final++``) that don't access instance data can be ``++static++`` to prevent any misunderstanding about the contract of the method.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
class Utilities {
  private static String magicWord = "magic";

  private String getMagicWord() { // Noncompliant
    return magicWord;
  }

  private void setMagicWord(String value) { // Noncompliant
    magicWord = value;
  }

}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
class Utilities {
  private static String magicWord = "magic";

  private static String getMagicWord() {
    return magicWord;
  }

  private static void setMagicWord(String value) {
    magicWord = value;
  }

}
----

=== Exceptions

When ``++java.io.Serializable++`` is implemented the following three methods are excluded by the rule:

* ``++private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException;++``
* ``++private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;++``
* ``++private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;++``

Hello,

I am interested in justification and history of this issue. Basically, this rule looks very strange and I would like to know how this concept was invented.

What I found:

1. Initially, someone figured that methods, which do not access instance fields should be static, but didn't explained why.

2. Next other someone realized that the rule is wrong for non-private methods. So the rule is implemented only for private methods, but without explanation why

3. I also found that initially someone expected that the rule has (among others) performance meaning, but someone later realized that it is not true. I think it was a good moment to review sense of the rule, but the review was not performed.


I applied the rule to joda time library and 19 code smells was detected.


Do you think that code

----
/**
  * Checks whether the period is non-null.
  * 
  * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the period is null
  */
 private void checkPeriod(ReadablePeriod period) {
     if (period == null) {
         throw new IllegalArgumentException("Period must not be null");
     }
 }
----

smells bad and ``++private static void checkPeriod(ReadablePeriod period)++`` smells good?


I think that the rule was based on wrong assumption, was heavy modified without review the sense and encourages to bad style coding. Effectively, it is anti-rule and should be deleted.
