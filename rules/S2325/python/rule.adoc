Class methods that don't access instance data can and should be static because they yield more performant code.


To implement a static method in Python one should use either ``++@classmethod++`` or ``++@staticmethod++``. A class method receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance. A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class Utilities:
    def do_the_thing(self, arg1, arg2, ...):  # Noncompliant
        #...
----

== Compliant Solution

----
class Utilities:
    @classmethod
    def do_the_thing(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
        #...
----
or

----
class Utilities:
    @staticmethod
    def do_the_thing(arg1, arg2, ...):
        #...
----

== Exceptions

Methods which raise or may raise a ``++NotImplementedError++`` are ignored.
