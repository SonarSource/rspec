== Why is this an issue?

Copy assignment operators and move assignment operators can return anything, including ``++void++``.

However, if you decide to declare them yourself (don't forget the "Rule-of-Zero" described in S3624),
it is a recommended practice to return a non-const reference to the assigned object (left-operand).
It allows the developer to chain the assignment operations, increasing consistency with what other types do and, in some cases, enabling the writing of concise code.

This rule will raise for assignment operators that deviate from the above expectation.

=== Using an unconventional return type

This rule will raise an issue if the return type of the copy or move assignment operator,
is different from mutable reference to the class type.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  const Clazz& operator=(const Clazz& other); // Noncompliant, returns const reference
  Clazz operator=(Clazz&& other) noexcept;    // Noncompliant, returns by value
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& operator=(const Clazz& other);      // Compliant
  Clazz& operator=(Clazz&& other) noexcept;  // Compliant
};
----

=== Returning an object different from ``++*this++``

An assignment operator should return a reference to the assigned object.
Conventionally, such return is expressed as ``++return *this++``, and the rule will mark any return statement as deviating from this convention.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& set(Clazz& other);
  Clazz& operator=(Clazz const& other) {
    return set(other); // Noncompliant: depends on return of `set` member function
  }

  Clazz&& operator=(Clazz&& other) noexcept {
    return other;      // Noncompliant, also return type is non-compliant
  }
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& set(Clazz& other);
  Clazz& operator=(Clazz const& other) {
    set(other);
    return *this;      // Compliant
  }

  Clazz& operator=(Clazz&& other) noexcept {
    return *this;      // Compliant
  }
};
----

In {cpp}23, if the assignment operator is declared using an explicit object argument,
the rule will mark any return statement that does not return the object parameter directly.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& set(Clazz& other);
  Clazz& operator=(this Clazz& self, Clazz const& other) {
    return self.set(other); // Noncompliant: depends on the return of `set` member function
  }
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& set(Clazz& other);
  Clazz& operator=(this Clazz& self, Clazz const& other) {
    self.set(other);
    return self;      // Compliant
  }
};
----

=== Declaring assignment operation as non-mutating

The assignment operation is designed to change the value of the target object,
to the same one as the source.
Such operation is mutating and thus should not be declared with a `const` qualifier.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& operator=(Clazz const& other) const { // Noncompliant: also leads to noncompliant return statement
    return const_cast<Clazz&>(*this);
  }
  Class& operator=(Clazz&& other) const; // Noncompliant
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Clazz {
public:
  Clazz& operator=(Clazz const& other) { // Compliant
    return *this;
  }
  Clazz& operator=(Clazz&& other); // Compliant
};
----

When declaring an assignment operator with {cpp}23 explicit object argument,
the object argument should not be passed:

* by const reference - this is equivalent to declaring the implicit object parameter method as `const`,
                       as described above;
* by value - in this case a temporary object will be created, and modified by the assignment operator,
             instead of the left-hand side of the assignment operator

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Clazz {
  int val;
public:
  Clazz& operator=(this Clazz const& self, Clazz const& other) const { // Noncompliant: also leads to non-compliant return
    return const_cast<Clazz&>(self);
  }
  void operator=(this Clazz self, Clazz&& other) { // Noncompliant
    self.val = other.val; // Modifies temporary object
  }
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Clazz {
  int val;
public:
  Clazz& operator=(this Clazz& self, Clazz const& other) { // Compliant
    self.val = other.val;
    return self;
  }
  Clazz& operator=(this Clazz& self, Clazz&& other) { // Compliant
    self.val = other.val; // Modifies referenced object
    return self;
  }
};
----
=== Declaring the assignment operator as volatile

Doing so impacts overload resolution and how ``++*this++`` is treated inside the function body. It is very uncommon and usually unnecessary.

=== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue when the assignment operator's return type is declared `void.`
That syntax is commonly used when assignment operator chaining is not desired.
The issue will still be raised if such an assignment operator is declared as non-mutating.

[source,cpp]
----
class Clazz {
  int val;
public:
  void operator=(Clazz const& other) { // Compliant
    self.val = other.val;
    return self;
  }
  void operator=(Clazz&& other) const; // Noncompliant: declared as const
};
