== Why is this an issue?

Copy assignment operators and move assignment operators can return anything, including ``++void++``.


However, if you decide to declare them yourself (don't forget the "Rule-of-Zero", S4963), it is a recommended practice to return a non-const reference to the left-operand. It allows the developer to chain the assignment operations, increasing consistency with what other types do, and in some cases enabling writing concise code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class A {
public:
  ~A() = default;
  A(A const &) = default;
  A(A&&) = default;
  const A& operator=(const A& other) ; // Noncompliant
  A operator=(A&& other) noexcept; // Noncompliant
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class A {
public:
  ~A() = default;
  A(A const &) = default;
  A(A&&) = default;
  A& operator=(const A& other);
  A& operator=(A&& other) noexcept;
};
----
