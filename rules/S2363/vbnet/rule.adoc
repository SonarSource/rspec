Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all ``++Private Shared ReadOnly++`` field names comply with the provided regular expression.


The default configuration is:

* Optionally, can start with an underscore character or "s_", e.g. ``++_foo++``, ``++s_foo++``
* Camel casing, starting with a lower case character, e.g. backColor
* Short abbreviations of 2 letters can be capitalized only when not at the beginning, e.g. "id" in productID
* Longer abbreviations need to be lower cased, e.g. html

== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default regular expression ``++^(s_|_)?[a-z][a-z0-9]*([A-Z]{1,3}[a-z0-9]+)*([A-Z]{2})?$++``:

----
Class Foo
    Private Shared ReadOnly Foo As Integer  ' Noncompliant
End Class
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Class Foo
    Private Shared ReadOnly foo As Integer  ' Compliant
End Class
----
