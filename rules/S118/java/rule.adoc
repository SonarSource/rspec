Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all ``++abstract++`` class names match a provided regular expression. If a non-abstract class match the regular expression, an issue is raised to suggest to either make it abstract or to rename it.


== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default regular expression: ``++^Abstract[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$++``:

----
abstract class MyClass { // Noncompliant
}

class AbstractLikeClass { // Noncompliant
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
abstract class AbstractClass {
}

class LikeClass {
}
----
