== Why is this an issue?

Include injections occur in an application when the application retrieves data from a
user or a third-party service and inserts it into an include expression without sanitizing it first.

If an application contains an `include` expression that is vulnerable to injections, 
it is exposed to attacks that target the underlying server.

=== What is the potential impact?
A user with malicious intent can create requests that will cause the `include` expression to
leak valuable data or achieve remote code execution on the server's website.

After creating the malicious request, the attacker can attack the servers
affected by this vulnerability without relying on any prerequisites.

The impact depends on the access control measures taken on the target system
OS. In the worst-case scenario, the process runs with root privileges, and
therefore any OS commands or programs may be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Denial of service and data leaks

In this scenario, the attack aims to disrupt the organization's activities and
profit from data leaks.

An attacker could, for example:

* download the internal server's data, most likely to sell it
* modify data, send malware
* stop services or exhaust resources (with fork bombs for example)

This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).

==== Root privilege escalation and pivot

In this scenario, the attacker can do everything described in the previous
section. The difference is that the attacker also manages to elevate their
privileges to an administrative level and attacks other servers.

Here, the impact depends on how much the target company focuses on its Defense
In Depth. For example, the entire infrastructure can be compromised by a
combination of OS injections and *misconfiguration* of:

* Docker or Kubernetes clusters
* cloud services
* network firewalls and routing
* OS access control

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
$filename = $_GET["filename"];
include $filename; // Noncompliant
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
$INCLUDE_ALLOW_LIST = [
    "home.php",
    "dashboard.php",
    "profile.php",
    "settings.php"
];

$filename = $_GET["filename"];
if (in_array($filename, $INCLUDE_ALLOW_LIST)) {
  include $filename;
}
----

=== How does this work?

== Use whitelisting

The universal method to prevent include injection is to allow only a whitelist of inputs to be passed to the include function.
This whitelist should contain only files that are safe to include. Manual sanitization is error-prone, so it is best to be as restrictive as possible.

Here, the variable `$whitelist` contains a list of the only allowed files to include. If the user controlled variable `$filename` contains anything that is **not** in the whitelist
the include statement will not be executed, preventing the injection of any unwanted inputs.
