The vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to read arbitrary files and
execute arbitrary code on the web server, such as source code, API keys, or
configuration files. +
This is possible because user-provided data, such as URL parameters, are used
without validation to determine the file that should be executed or included
into the page.
