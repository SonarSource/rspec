PHP include injections occur in a web application when it retrieves data from a
user or a third-party service and inserts it all or part of the filename that
is passed to `include`-type expressions without sanitizing it first.

If an application contains an include expression that is vulnerable to
injections, it is exposed to attacks that aim to leak valuable data or achieve
remote code execution on the server's website.

A user with malicious intent carefully performs actions whose goal is to modify
the existing expression to change its logic to a malicious one.

After creating the malicious request, the attacker can attack the servers
affected by this vulnerability without relying on any pre-requisites.
