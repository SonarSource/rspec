=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker exploiting an include injection vulnerability will be able to read
or execute arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.

The impact depends on the initial expression logic, as well access control
measures taken on the target system OS. +
In the worst-case scenario, the process runs with root privileges and the
include injection leads to command execution. In that case, anything in the
server's scope may be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Identity spoofing and data manipulation

A malicious database expression might enable direct data leakage from one or
more application servers. This threat is the most widespread impact.

A malicious actor's goal there is most likely to make money out of it, or to
harm the company's reputation, by:

* Selling access or data in underground criminal forums
* Leaking the data in public

Some sensitive examples include:

* Sensitive API keys in configuration files (AWS, Azure, GCP, mail services, etc.)
* Personal customer data, phone numbers, bank information
* Database credentials and/or backups
* SSH private keys

==== Remote code execution

If the attackers extract proprietary source code or various configuration
files, it is also likely that they use this intelligence to further intrude the
impacted organization.

An attacker could, for example:

* modify data, send malware
* stop services or exhaust resources (with fork bombs for example)

This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).

==== Root privilege escalation and pivot

In this scenario, the attacker can do everything described in the previous
section. The difference is that the attacker also manages to elevate their
privileges to an administrative level and attacks other servers.

Here, the impact depends on how much the target company focuses on its Defense
In Depth. For example, the entire infrastructure can be compromised by a
combination of remote code execution and *misconfiguration* of:

* Docker or Kubernetes clusters
* cloud services
* network firewalls and routing
* OS access control

Attack scenarios involving code execution can be easily detected with Linux
auditing tools, and might be avoided by attackers, for stealth reasons.
