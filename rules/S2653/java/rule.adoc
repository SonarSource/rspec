There is no reason to have a ``++main++`` method in a web application. It may have been useful for debugging during application development, but such a method should never make it into production. Having a ``++main++`` method in a web application opens a door to the application logic that an attacker may never be able to reach (but watch out if one does!), but it is a sloppy practice and indicates that other problems may be present.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++main++`` method is found in a servlet or an EJB.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
    if (userIsAuthorized(req)) {
      updatePrices(req);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) { // Noncompliant
    updatePrices(req);
  }
}
