Running `update` of your package manager in a single `RUN` instruction stores the cache index in the file system.
This cache is not needed for the good working of the installed software.

== Why is this an issue?

Leaving unnecessary files in Docker image increases its size.
The Docker images should be small and should only contain necessary data.
The cache index is obsolete after installation.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
RUN apk update
RUN apt-get update
RUN aptitude update
----

Here each line represents an update command for the most popular package managers.
Each of them stores the cache index in the newly created layer.

==== Compliant solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
RUN apk update && apk add ...
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install ...
RUN aptitude update && aptitude install ...
----

Here in each line after the update, the package installation is executed.
However, it happens in single `RUN` instruction so only one layer is created.
After installing all packages also the cleanup of the cache index should be done.
For more details please see rule S6587.

=== How does this work?

Each execution of `RUN` instruction creates a new layer in Docker.
If single command `apt-get update` or equivalent is executed, the cache is stored in the new layer.
This increases the size of the final image.
Even removing those cache in the next `RUN` instruction doesn't decrease the size of the final image.
This overhead is not needed in the Docker image.
Updating the cache and installing packages should be executed in one step (one `RUN` instruction).
