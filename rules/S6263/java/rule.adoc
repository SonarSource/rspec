In AWS, long-term access keys will be valid until you manually revoke them. This makes them highly sensitive as any exposure can have serious consequences and should be used with care.

This rule will trigger when encountering an instantiation of `com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials`.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The access key is used directly in an application or AWS CLI script running on an Amazon EC2 instance.
* Cross-account access is needed.
* The access keys need to be embedded within a mobile application.
* Existing identity providers (SAML 2.0, on-premises identity store) already exists.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html#use-roles[Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys].

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Consider using IAM roles or other features of the AWS Security Token Service that provide temporary credentials, limiting the risks.


== Sensitive Code Example

----
import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentials;
import com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials;
// ...

AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKeyId, secretAccessKey);
----


== Compliant Solution

Example for AWS STS (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/prog-services-sts.html[Getting Temporary Credentials with AWS STS]).

[source,java]
----
BasicSessionCredentials sessionCredentials = new BasicSessionCredentials(
   session_creds.getAccessKeyId(),
   session_creds.getSecretAccessKey(),
   session_creds.getSessionToken());
----

I think a related idea is that instead of passing secrets to a cloud application directly in configuration or environment names, it's better to pass the _name or the ARN of secrets_, which the application can use to fetch the actual secrets from the Secrets Manager service.
