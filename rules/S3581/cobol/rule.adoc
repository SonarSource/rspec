The comparison of numeric values of different formats is inefficient. For instance, comparing a ``++COMP-3++`` with a ``++COMP-4++`` causes a performance drag because conversions are required under the covers before the comparison.


This rule raises an issue when variables with different ``++USAGE++`` clauses, or different numbers of decimal places are compared.


== Noncompliant Code Example

01 WS-BIN PIC S9999 COMP-4
01 WS-DISPLAY-2	PIC 9(4)

PERFORM VARYING SUB1 FROM WS-DISPLAY-1
BY WS-PACKED-DEC
