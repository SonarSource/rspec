== Why is this an issue?

To parametrize an algorithm with a function, you can use one of the following techniques:

* A function pointer
* A typed-erased function wrapper such as `std::function` ({cpp}11) or `std::move_only_function` ({cpp}23)
* A template parameter

S5205 explains why using function pointers is an inferior solution.

=== Working with typed-erased function wrappers

Thanks to type erasure, `std::function` is very flexible to use.
You can store it in variables, including containers such as ``++std::map<std::string, std::function<void(void)>>++``.
In other words, `std::function` can represent any kind of functor, including lambdas, as long as their signatures are compatible.

`std::move_only_function` is very similar to `std::function`.
The main difference is that, as its name implies, it cannot be copied and has to be moved.
You can use it to store a lambda capturing a non-copyable object such as `std::unique_ptr`, which cannot be done with `std::function`.

The abstraction offered by `std::function` and `std::move_only_function` comes at a cost: a compiler typically cannot inline a call to these types due to the type erasure.

Additionally, these wrappers can be "empty", meaning they do not currently represent any callable.
While invoking an empty `std::function` throws a `std::bad_function_call`, invoking an empty `std::move_only_function` results in undefined behavior.

// We could also explain that move_only_function is better at const-, noexpect-, and r-valuesness-correctness.
// But it would bring little to the discussion, if not only confusion.

=== Working with template-parameters

Template parameters are less flexible than the type-erased wrapper:
Each functor has its own type, which prevents storing different parameters together in a container even if they all have compatible signatures.

On the other hand, since each template instance knows the type of the functor, calls can be inlined, making this a zero-cost abstraction.

Additionally, template parameters representing lambdas cannot be "empty".
Therefore, by construction, there is no risk of undefined behavior or the need to handle `std::bad_function_call` when invoking such parameters.

Furthermore, {cpp}20 concepts, such as `std::predicate` or `std::regular_invocable`, can enforce expected signatures and provide useful compile-time error messages when incorrect functors are passed to your parametrized function.

=== Which solution to choose?

In conclusion, if a functor is known at compile-time, you should prefer using a template parameter; if it has to be dynamic, a typed-erased function wrapper gives you greater flexibility.

This rule detects function parameters of type `std::function` and `std::move_only_function` that can likely benefit from being replaced by a template parameter. It does so by looking at whether the functor is only called inside the function or if it participates in other operations.

=== Exceptions

This rule ignores virtual functions because they don't work well with templates.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

Here, we show an example where the `filter` function is parametrized with a predicate represented using `std::function`.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
using Criterion = std::function<bool(DataPoint const&)>;
void filter(DataSet& data, Criterion criterion) { // Noncompliant
  for (auto const& dataPoint : data) {
    if (criterion(dataPoint)) {
      data.markForRemoval(dataPoint);
    }
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Here is a solution based on {cpp}20's concept `std::predicate` that ensures the template parameter has a compatible signature.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
template <std::predicate<DataPoint const&> Criterion>
void filter(DataSet& data, Criterion criterion) { // Compliant
  for (auto const& dataPoint : data) {
    if (criterion(dataPoint)) {
      data.markForRemoval(dataPoint);
    }
  }
}
----

If you are using {cpp}17, you can use `static_assert` with `std::is_invocable_r_v`:

[source,cpp]
----
template <typename Criterion>
void filter(DataSet& data, Criterion criterion) { // Compliant
  static_assert(std::is_invocable_r_v<bool, Criterion, DataPoint const&>);
  for (auto const& dataPoint : data) {
    if (criterion(dataPoint)) {
      data.markForRemoval(dataPoint);
    }
  }
}
----
