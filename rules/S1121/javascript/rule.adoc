== Exceptions

The rule does not raise issues for the following patterns:


* assignments at declaration-level: ``++let a = b = 0;++``
* chained assignments: ``++a = b = c = 0;++``
* relational assignments: ``++(a = 0) != b++``
* sequential assignments: ``++a = 0, b = 1, c = 2++``
* assignments in lambda body: ``++() => a = 0++``
* conditional assignment idiom: ``++a || (a = 0)++``
* assignments in (do-)while conditions: ``++while (a = 0);++``
