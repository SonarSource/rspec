=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(result = str.Substring(index, length))) // Noncompliant
{
  //...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
var result = str.Substring(index, length);
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(result))
{
  //...
}
----

=== Exceptions

Assignments inside lambda and delegate expressions are allowed. 


Furthermore, the following patterns are also accepted:

----
var a = b = c = 10;
----

----
while ((val = GetNewValue()) > 0)
{
...
}
----

----
private MyClass instance;
public MyClass Instance
{
  get
  {
    return instance ?? (instance = new MyClass());
  }
}

This rule doesn't cover the R# compiler warning (which is out of the box in Roslyn).

See \https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c1sde1ax.aspx for details on how that one behaves.


As this more generalized rule is way more crappy, I'm disabling it by default for C#
