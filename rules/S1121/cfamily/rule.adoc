=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
if (int a; a = arr[1]) {
  // do something with "a"
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
int a = arr[1];
if (a) {
  // do something with "a"
}
