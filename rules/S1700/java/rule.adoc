== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

When the type of the field is the containing class and that field is static, no issue is raised to allow singletons named like the type.

[source,java]
----
public class Foo {
  private static Foo foo;
  public Foo getInstance() {
    if(foo==null) {
      foo = new Foo();
    }
    return foo;
  }
}
