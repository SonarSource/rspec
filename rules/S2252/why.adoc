== Why is this an issue?

A {for-link}[`{for-keyword}`] loop is a fundamental programming construct used to execute a block of code repeatedly. However, if the loop's condition is false before the first iteration, the loop will never execute.

Rewrite the loop to ensure the condition evaluates to `true` at least once.

This bug has the potential to cause unexpected outcomes as the loop might contain critical code that needs to be executed.
