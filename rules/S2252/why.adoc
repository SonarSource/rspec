== Why is this an issue?

A {for-link}[`{for-keyword}`] loop is a fundamental programming construct used to execute a block of code repeatedly. However, if the loop's condition is false before the first iteration, the loop will never execute.

It is important to ensure the loop is executed by fixing the condition to evaluate to `true` at least once:

This bug has the potential to cause unexpected outcomes such as data loss and data corruption.
