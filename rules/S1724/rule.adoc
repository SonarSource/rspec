Deprecated classes and interfaces should be avoided, rather than used, inherited or extended. Deprecation is a warning that the class or interface has been superseded, and will eventually be removed. The deprecation period allows you to make a smooth transition away from the aging, soon-to-be-retired technology.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
/**
 * @deprecated  As of release 1.3, replaced by {@link #Fee}
 */@Deprecated
class Foo { ... }

class Bar extends Foo { ... }
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
class Bar extends Fee { ... }
----


== Exceptions

When the class that extends a deprecated class is itself deprecated, the extending class will be ignored.

----
@Deprecated
class Bar extends Foo { ... } // compliant Bar is deprecated.
----
