== Why is this an issue?

Primitives can be read and written to atomically. Except for ``++long++`` and ``++double++``, that is. These 64-bit primitives must be marked ``++volatile++`` in multi-threaded environments, or swapped out for their atomic counterparts: ``++AtomicLong++``, and ``++AtomicDouble++`` to guarantee that their updates are always visible to other threads.


Similarly, to ensure that updates to 32-bit primitives are visible to all threads, they should also be marked ``++volatile++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
long m = 0;  // Noncompliant

public void increment() {
  m++;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
volatile long m = 0;

public void increment() {
  m++;
}
----
or

[source,java]
----
AtomicLong m = new AtomicLong(0);

public void increment() {
  m.incrementAndGet();
}
----
