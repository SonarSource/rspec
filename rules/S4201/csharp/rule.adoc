There's no need to null test in conjunction with an ``++is++`` test. ``++null++`` is not an instance of anything, so a null check is redundant.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (x != null && x is MyClass) { ... }  // Noncompliant

if (x == null || !(x is MyClass)) { ... } // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
if (x is MyClass) { ... }

if (!(x is MyClass)) { ... }
----
