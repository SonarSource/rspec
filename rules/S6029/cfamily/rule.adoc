== Why is this an issue?

Starting {cpp}17, exception specifications became a part of a function type. This implies that these two functions, for example, have different types:


----
void first() noexcept;
void second();
----

Making exception specifications part of the type will, for the right reason, break code where a function that throws an exception is provided in a context where ``++noexcept++`` function is expected.


It is important to note that the same way it is not allowed to overload based on the return type, it is also not allowed to overload based on the exception specifications.


This rule will trigger on code that will stop compiling starting {cpp}17, and on explicit casts that add ``++noexcept++`` to a type.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T>
void callF1(T t1, T t2) {
  t1();
  t2();
}

void f1();
void f1NoExcept() noexcept;

int main() {
  callF1(f1, f1NoExcept); // Noncompliant, f1 and f1NoExcept have different types
  std::function<void() noexcept> fptr1 = f1; // Noncompliant
  void (*fptr2)() noexcept = f1; // Noncompliant
  void (*fptr3)() noexcept = (void (*)() noexcept) f1; // Noncompliant, it works even in c++17
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T1, typename T2>
void callF1(T1 t1, T2 t2) {
  t1();
  t2();
}

void f1();
void f1NoExcept() noexcept;

int main() {
  callF1(f1, f1NoExcept); // Compliant
  std::function<void() noexcept> fptr1 = f1NoExcept; // Compliant
  void (*fptr2)() = f1; // Compliant
}
----
