The title should be changed to something like: "Variables which have 88-level variables should not be compared with literals".

I think the rule should not check only literal strings but also literal numbers.


The official documentations (e.g. http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6SG3_5.1.0/com.ibm.entcobol.doc_5.1/PGandLR/ref/rlddeva2.html[IBM]) have some precise names for these "variables":

* 88-level variables are called "condition names".
* variables on which "condition names" are defined are called "conditional variables"

However, I'm not sure that developers use these names.
