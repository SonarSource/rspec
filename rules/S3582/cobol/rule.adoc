== Why is this an issue?

88-level variables, also known as "condition name" variables, each have a name, a value or set of values, and a "parent" variable. Those parent variables are called "conditional variables".


Each 88-level variable can be seen as a short-cut conditional for testing the value of the parent: ``++IF MY-88++`` will intrinsically return ``++true++`` if the parent value matches ``++MY-88++``'s value, and ``++false++`` if it does not. 


Thus, testing a conditional variable against a literal value is redundant and confusing. Just use the 88-levels instead.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
01 COLOR PIC X
  88 YELLOW VALUE 'Y'
  88 GREEN VALUE 'G'
  88 RED VALUE 'R'
...
IF COLOR = 'G' *> Noncompliant
...
END-IF
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cobol]
----
01 COLOR PIC X
  88 YELLOW VALUE 'Y'
  88 GREEN VALUE 'G'
  88 RED VALUE 'R'
...
IF GREEN
...
END-IF
----
