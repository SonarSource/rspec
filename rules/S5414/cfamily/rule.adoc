Mixing (non-const) ``++public++`` and ``++private++`` data members is a bad practice because it causes confusion about the intention of the class:

* If the class is a collection of loosely related values, all the data members should be ``++public++``.
* On the other hand, if the class is trying to maintain an invariant, all the data members should be ``++private++``.

If we mix data members with different levels of accessibility, the purpose of the class is muddled.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyClass // Noncompliant
{
public:
  int firstNumber1() const { return firstNumber; }
  void setFirstNumber(int firstNumber) { this->firstNumber = firstNumber; }
  int secondNumber = 2;
  const int constNumber = 0; // const data members are fine
private:
  int firstNumber = 1;
};
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class MyClass // Depending on the case, the solution might be different. Here, since this class does not enforce any invariant, we make all the data members public
{
public:
  int firstNumber;
  int secondNumber;
  const int constNumber = 0;
};
----


== Exceptions

Since ``++const++`` data members cannot be modified, it's not breaking encapsulation to make a const value public, even in a class that enforces an invariant.
