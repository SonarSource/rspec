Second, is this rule about having in the same class members that are both non-``++const++`` and ``++public++`` along with members that are ``++private++`` with whatever ``++const++``-ness? Because it is not clear to me from the title and description.


In fact, after multiple readings and some cogitation I think this is about having modifiable, ``++public++`` members in a class with ... _anything_ else in it? Because if I can modify the public members directly then what's the point of having methods? They certainly won't be able to notice/act on changes to the public members. 


And finally, I suggest the 2ndary locations highlight every public non-``++const++`` member, not just one of them.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I would say non-const public data members are fine is we mix them with const public data members and public member functions, but nothing else. Protected/private functions would not harm, but would probably not be very useful. So I'm not sure about detecting them. It's hard to find a title that is not too long... I even considered using the simpler (and less accurate) title "a class should not contain both public and private data members", and talk about the public const case  as an exception. What do you think?



Some people argue for no functions in "bag-of-data" classes. But it's not commonly accepted, since there is some value in providing some functions anyways, understanding that they will not provide encapsulation, but may still be useful:

* Constructors to enforce initialization of all members
* Utility functions, for instance to output the class on a stream, to send it to a database...
Some of those features might be provided by free functions, but sometimes a member function makes it easier to use...

I think this is a reasonable option altho it should be pluralized: Classes should not... Another title option is: Non-const data members should either all be public or all be private
