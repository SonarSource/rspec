== Why is this an issue?

The purpose of an abstract class is to provide some heritable behaviors while also defining methods which must be implemented by sub-classes.


A ``++class++`` with no abstract methods that was made ``++abstract++`` purely to prevent instantiation should be converted to a concrete ``++class++`` (i.e. remove the ``++abstract++`` keyword) with a ``++protected++`` constructor.


A ``++class++`` with only ``++abstract++`` methods and no inheritable behavior should be converted to an ``++interface++``.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public abstract class Animal // Noncompliant; should be an interface
{
  abstract void Move();
  abstract void Feed();
}

public abstract class Color // Noncompliant; should be concrete with a protected constructor
{
  private int red = 0;
  private int green = 0;
  private int blue = 0;

  public int GetRed()
  {
    return red;
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public interface Animal
{
  void Move();
  void Feed();
}

public class Color
{
  private int red = 0;
  private int green = 0;
  private int blue = 0;

  protected Color()
  {}

  public int GetRed()
  {
    return red;
  }
}

public abstract class Lamp
{
  private bool switchLamp = false;

  public abstract void Glow();

  public void FlipSwitch()
  {
    switchLamp = !switchLamp;
    if (switchLamp)
    {
      Glow();
    }
  }
}
