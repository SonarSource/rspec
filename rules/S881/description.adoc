The use of increment and decrement operators in method calls or in combination with other arithmetic operators is not recommended, because:
* It can significantly impair the readability of the code.
* It introduces additional side effects into a statement, with the potential for undefined behavior.
* It is safer to use these operators in isolation from any other arithmetic operators.
