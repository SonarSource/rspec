* MISRA C:2004, 12.1 - Limited dependence should be placed on the C operator precedence rules in expressions.
* MISRA C:2004, 12.13 - The increment ({plus}{plus}) and decrement (--) operators should not be mixed with other operators in an expression.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 5-2-10 - The increment ({plus}{plus}) and decrement (--) operator should not be mixed with other operators in an expression.
* MISRA C:2012, 12.1 - The precedence of operators within expressions should be made explicit
* MISRA C:2012, 13.3 - A full expression containing an increment ({plus}{plus}) or decrement (--) operator should have no other potential side effects other than that cause by the increment or decrement operator
* https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/x/StYxBQ[CERT, EXP30-C.] - Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side effects
* https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/x/IXw-BQ[CERT, EXP50-CPP.] - Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side effects
