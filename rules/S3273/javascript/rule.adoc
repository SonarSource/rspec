== Why is this an issue?

HTML5's cross-window messaging adds the ability to send messages directly from one window (or iframe) to another, without having to go through a server. This makes it easier to write interesting and responsive web sites, but adds vulnerability as well, since the same-origin policy does not apply here. For that reason, cross-window messaging listeners should always check message origins and use only those from trusted sites.


This rule raises an issue on each cross-window messaging listener that does not check message origins.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
window.addEventListener("message", function (event){  // Noncompliant
  // ...
}, false);
----
