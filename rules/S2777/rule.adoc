Even if the compiler allows it, ``++main++`` should not return ``++void++``. The return value of ``++main++`` is used by callers to determine whether the program executed successfully or not. A ``++0++`` return value indicates that the program completed successfully. Anything else indicates an error. 

Since both standards and conventions dictate that ``++main++`` return an ``++int++``, any caller that evaluates the return value of a ``++void main++`` method will believe the program executed successfully, regardless of the actual outcome.

Further, ``++main++``'s return type should not be left to default to ``++int++``, as happens when it is not expressly listed. Instead, it should be set explicitly to ``++int++``.
