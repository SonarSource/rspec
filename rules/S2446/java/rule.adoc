== Why is this an issue?

``++notify++`` and ``++notifyAll++`` both wake up sleeping threads, but ``++notify++`` only rouses one, while ``++notifyAll++`` rouses all of them. Since ``++notify++`` might not wake up the right thread, ``++notifyAll++`` should be used instead.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
class MyThread extends Thread{

  @Override
  public void run(){
    synchronized(this){
      // ...
      notify();  // Noncompliant
    }
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
class MyThread extends Thread{

  @Override
  public void run(){
    synchronized(this){
      // ...
      notifyAll();
    }
  }
}
----
