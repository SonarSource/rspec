<p>It is pointless and confusing to have an <code>interface</code> with only one implementer. Unless the presence of an <code>interface</code> is required by some framework, such interfaces should be eliminated.</p>

<p>This one will be hard to be implemented as we need to check the whole portfolio of projects. Moreover I would extend it to abstract classes.</p>

<p>\[~nicolas.peru] and [~freddy.mallet] the rule submitter believes that having the implementation named "*Impl" is/should be a key component in this rule. Since neither of us is convincing the other, would you review the reasoning and give me an opinion?</p>

<p>\[~ann.campbell.2]I am not really convinced by this one. We actually expose interfaces for our api to abstract away implementation and rename classes as we wish. Moreover basing a rule on a naming convention is not something I would go for.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another question would be : what about marker interfaces ? and as Freddy pointed it out : what about usage by other projects ?</p>

<p>At this point, I don&#8217;t think anyone, even the original submitter, is happy with this rule, so I&#8217;m going to close it.</p>
