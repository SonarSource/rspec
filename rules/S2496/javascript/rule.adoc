When using the Backbone.js framework, the internal hash containing the model's state, ``++model.attributes++``, should not be accessed directly. Doing so bypasses the listeners set on the model and could put your application in a bad state.


Instead, you should use ``++set++`` to update, ``++get++`` to read, and ``++_.clone(model.attributes)++`` to obtain a copy.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
myModel.attributes.someAttribute = 1;
----


== Compliant Solution

----
myModel.set({ someAttribute: 1 });
