== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

To protect Azure Storage Account Keys, these recommendations apply:

* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/[Azure Key Vault] should be used to store and manage keys. 
* Keys should not be shared with other users.
* Keys should not be hard-coded in the source code of the application.
* Rotate the keys that have been compromised.

To authorize access to an Azure Storage from an application, create a service principal and assign it the least privileges needed to use Azure Storage. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-msi?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json#authenticate-with-the-azure-identity-library[Azure Identity SDK] provides several options such as _DefaultAzureCredential_ that can be used to retrieve secrets from environment variables for instance.
