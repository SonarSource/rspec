== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Only administrators should have access to storage account keys. To authorize an application to access an Azure Storage, it's recommended to create a service principal and assign it the required privileges only. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-msi?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json#authenticate-with-the-azure-identity-library[Azure Identity SDK] provides several options such as _DefaultAzureCredential_ that can be used to retrieve secrets from, for instance, environment variables.

Storage account keys should not be stored with the application code or saved anywhere in plain text accessible to others. Consider using an https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/[Azure Key Vault] to store and manage keys. 

When credentials are disclosed in the application code, consider them as compromised and rotate them immediately.
