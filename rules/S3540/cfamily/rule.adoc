== Why is this an issue?

Adding an access specifier that matches the class' current access level needlessly clutters the code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct B {
};

struct S : public B { // Noncompliant; "struct" has public access for its base classes by default
};

class C : private B { // Noncompliant; "class" has private access for its base classes by default
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct B {
};

struct S : B {
};

class C : B {
};
----

* S5965 and S5966 are other rules that favor different coding style for base classes. They should not be activated at the same time as this rule.
