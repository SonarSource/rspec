I intentionally didn't add an exception about multi-inheritance with different visibilities:

https://github.com/SonarSource/it-sources/blob/master/cpp/ruling/cpp/cmake-2.8.12.2/Source/cmGeneratedFileStream.h#L79

It's the following case:

----
class C : public A, B { }
----
Where some developers add redundant specifier to make a clear distinction between public and private:

----
class C : public A, private B { }
----
An exception for the above case could be useful for a minority of junior developer that confuse inheritance. But will be seen as non homogeneous by the remaining majority.
