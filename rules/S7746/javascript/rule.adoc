This rule raises an issue when `Promise.resolve()` or `Promise.reject()` are returned or yielded in async functions, async generators, or promise callback methods (then/catch/finally).

== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, async functions and promise callback methods automatically wrap return values in promises. Using `Promise.resolve()` or `Promise.reject()` in these contexts creates unnecessary complexity and redundancy.

When you return a value from an async function, it's automatically wrapped in a resolved promise. Similarly, when you return from a `.then()`, `.catch()`, or `.finally()` callback, the value is automatically wrapped in a promise.

For error handling, throwing an error is more idiomatic and clearer than returning `Promise.reject()`. The `throw` statement clearly indicates that an error condition has occurred, while `return Promise.reject()` obscures this intent.

This redundancy makes code harder to read and understand, especially for developers learning async programming patterns. It also suggests a misunderstanding of how promises and async functions work.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue primarily affects code maintainability and readability. While it doesn't cause runtime errors, it:

* Makes code unnecessarily verbose and harder to understand
* Suggests confusion about async programming concepts
* Can mislead other developers about the actual behavior of the code
* Reduces consistency with modern JavaScript async/await best practices

=== How to fix?


Remove the unnecessary Promise.resolve() wrapper and return the value directly in async functions.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const fetchData = async () => {
  const result = await getData();
  return Promise.resolve(result); // Noncompliant
};
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const fetchData = async () => {
  const result = await getData();
  return result;
};
