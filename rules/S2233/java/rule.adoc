== Why is this an issue?

The implementation of certain ``++ResultSet++`` methods is optional for result sets of type ``++TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY++``. Even if your current JDBC driver does implement those methods, there's no guarantee you won't change drivers in the future.


This rule looks for invocations of the following methods on ``++TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY++`` ``++ResultSet++``s:

* ``++isBeforeFirst++``
* ``++isAfterLast++``
* ``++isFirst++``
* ``++getRow++``


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
Statement stmt = con.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY);
stmt.executeQuery("SELECT name, address FROM PERSON");
ResultSet rs = stmt.getResultSet();

if (rs.isBeforeFirst()) { // Noncompliant

}
----
