== Why is this an issue?

----
char* ptr = “Hello”;         // Pointer and data are not const
const char* ptr = “Hello”; // Pointer is not const but data are const
char* const ptr = “Hello”;  // Pointer is const but data are not const
const char* const ptr = “Hello”;  // Pointer and data are const
void foo(const double& d1)  // d1 parameter cannot be modified inside foo function
{...}
----

It avoid not wished modifications
