== Why is this an issue?

Element selections that could be matched anywhere in the document can be very slow. That's why use of the universal selector, ``++*++``, should be limited; it explicitly specifies that the match could be anywhere.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
$( ".buttons > *" );  // Noncompliant; extremely expensive
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
$( ".buttons" ).children(); // Compliant
----
