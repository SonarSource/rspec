== Why is this an issue?

Unnecessary `using` directives refer to importing namespaces, types or creating aliases that are not used or referenced anywhere in the code.

include::../description.adoc[]

Starting with C# 10, it's possible to define https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive#global-modifier[global usings] for an entire project. They reduce the need for repetitive namespace inclusions, but can also mask which namespaces are truly necessary for the code at hand. Over-relying on them can lead to less transparent code dependencies, especially for newcomers to the project.

=== Exceptions

The rule will not raise a warning for `global using` directives, even if none of the types of that namespace are used in the project:

[source,csharp]
----
global using System.Net.Sockets; // Compliant by exception
----

Unnecessary `using` directives are ignored in ASP.NET Core projects in the following files:

* `_Imports.razor`
* `_ViewImports.cshtml`

== How to fix it

While it's not difficult to remove these unneeded lines manually, modern code editors support the removal of every unnecessary `using` directive with a single click from every file of the project.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;   // Noncompliant - no types are used from this namespace    
using MyApp.Helpers;                // Noncompliant - FileHelper is in the same namespace
using MyCustomNamespace;            // Noncompliant - no types are used from this namespace

namespace MyApp.Helpers
{
    public class FileHelper
    {
        public static string ReadFirstLine(string filePath) =>
            File.ReadAllLines(filePath).First();
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;

namespace MyApp.Helpers
{
    public class FileHelper
    {
        public static string ReadFirstLine(string filePath) =>
            File.ReadAllLines(filePath).First();
    }
}

*OUT OF SCOPE*


Duplicate imports are out of scopes as Roslyn already raises an issue in this case. As Roslyn issues are enabled by default thisÂ would simply create duplicates.

We are removing this rule from SonarWay due to its performance issues. After the rule gets re-designed to avoid perf issues, (see https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues/3761[#3761]), we should bring it back to SonarWay.
