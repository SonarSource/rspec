Although they don't affect the runtime behavior of the application after compilation, removing them will:

* Improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
* Help avoid potential naming conflicts.
* Improve the build time, as the compiler has fewer lines to read and fewer types to resolve.
* Reduce the number of items the code editor will show for auto-completion, thereby showing fewer irrelevant suggestions.
