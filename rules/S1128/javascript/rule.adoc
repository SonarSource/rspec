== Why is this an issue?

There's no reason to import modules you don't use; and every reason not to: doing so needlessly increases the load.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
import A from 'a';      // Noncompliant, A isn't used
import { B1 } from 'b';

console.log(B1);
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
import { B1 } from 'b';

console.log(B1);
----
