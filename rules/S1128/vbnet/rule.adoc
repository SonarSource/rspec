== Why is this an issue?

Although unnecessary won't change anything to the produced application, removing them:

* Will help readability and maintenance.
* Will help reduce the number of items in the IDE auto-completion list when coding.
* May avoid some name collisions.
* May improve compilation time because the compiler has fewer namespaces to look-up when it resolves types.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Imports System.Collections.Generic // Noncompliant - unnecessary using

Module Module1
    Sub Main(path As String)
        File.ReadAllLines(path);
    End Sub
End Module
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Imports System.IO

Module Module1
    Sub Main(path As String)
        File.ReadAllLines(path);
    End Sub
End Module
