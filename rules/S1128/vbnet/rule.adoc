Although unnecessary won't change anything to the produced application, removing them:

* Will help readability and maintenance.
* Will help reduce the number of items in the IDE auto-completion list when coding.
* May avoid some name collisions.
* May improve compilation time because the compiler has fewer namespaces to look-up when it resolves types.
