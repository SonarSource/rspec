== Why is this an issue?

``++Eval++`` and ``++Callp++`` are the only two exceptions to the rule that each free-format line must start with an operation code. Since you can leave these two opcodes out, you should for cleaner, more readable code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,rpg]
----
Eval Regpay = hours * perHour;
Callp calcTax();
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,rpg]
----
Regpay = hours * perHour;
calcTax();
----
