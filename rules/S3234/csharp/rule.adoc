``++GC.SuppressFinalize++`` asks the Common Language Runtime not to call the finalizer of an object. This is useful when implementing the dispose pattern where object finalization is already handled in ``++IDisposable.Dispose++``. However, it has no effect if there is no finalizer defined in the object's type, so using it in such cases is just confusing.


This rule raises an issue when ``++GC.SuppressFinalize++`` is called for objects of ``++sealed++`` types without a finalizer.


*Note:* S3971 is a stricter version of this rule. Typically it makes sense to activate only one of these 2 rules.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
sealed class MyClass
{
  public void Method()
  {
    ...
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this); //Noncompliant
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
sealed class MyClass
{
  public void Method()
  {
    ...
  }
}
