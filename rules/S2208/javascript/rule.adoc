== Why is this an issue?

On the principle that clearer code is better code, you should explicitly ``++import++`` the things you want to use in a module. Using ``++import *++`` imports everything in the module, and runs the risk of confusing maintainers. Similarly, ``++export * from "module";++`` imports and then re-exports everything in the module, and runs the risk of confusing not just maintainers but also users of the module.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
import * as Imported from "aModule";  // Noncompliant
