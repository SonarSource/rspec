== Why is this an issue?

Using wildcards in imports may look cleaner as it reduces the number of lines in the import section and simplifies the code. +
On the other hand, it makes the code harder to maintain:

* It reduces code readability as developers will have a hard time knowing where names come from.
* It could lead to conflicts between names defined locally and the ones imported.
* It could later raise conflicts on dependency upgrade or Java version migration, as a wildcard import that works today might be broken tomorrow.

That is why it is better to import only the specific classes or modules you need.


=== Exceptions

Static imports are ignored by this rule. For example:

[source,java]
----
import static java.lang.Math.*;
----

will not raise an issue;

== How to fix it

Depending on your IDE you can solve this issue almost **automatically**: +
Look for **Organize/Optimize imports** actions.
These actions can also often be applied automatically on save. +
__Note:__ To make this work properly, you must adjust IDE settings to use a very high `allowed class count usage` before using wildcards.

Resolving this issue **manually** will require a step-by-step approach:

. Remove one wildcard import and note down compilation failures.
. For each missing class, import it back with the package prefix.
. When the code compiles again, proceed with the next wildcard import.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import java.sql.*; // Noncompliant
import java.util.*; // Noncompliant

private Date date; // Date class exists in java.sql and java.util. Which one is this?
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import java.sql.Date;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

private Date date;
----
