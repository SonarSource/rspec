There are situations where `+super()+` must be invoked and situations where `+super()+` cannot be invoked.

The basic rule is: a constructor in a non-derived class cannot invoke `+super()+`; a constructor in a derived class must invoke `+super()+`.

Furthermore:
- `+super()+` must be invoked before the `+this+` and `+super+` keywords can be used.
- `+super()+` must be invoked with the same number of arguments as the base class' constructor.
- `+super()+` can only be invoked in a constructor - not in any other method.
- `+super()+` cannot be invoked multiple times in the same constructor.

=== Known Limitations

* False negatives: some issues are not raised if the base class is not defined in the same file as the current class.
