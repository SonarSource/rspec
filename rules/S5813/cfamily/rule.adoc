The function ``++size_t strlen(const char *s)++`` measures the length of the string `s` (excluding the final null character). +
The function ``++size_t wcslen(const wchar_t *s)++`` does the same for wide characters, and should be used with the same guidelines.

Similarly to many other functions in the standard C libraries,
`strlen` and `wcslen` assume that their argument is not a null pointer.

Additionally, they expect the strings to be null-terminated.
For example, the 5-letter string "abcde" must be stored in memory as "abcde\0" (i.e. using 6 characters) to be processed correctly.
When a string is missing the null character at the end, these functions will iterate past the end of the buffer, which is undefined behavior.

Therefore, string parameters must end with a proper null character.
The absence of this particular character can lead to security vulnerabilities that allow, for example, access to sensitive data or the execution of arbitrary code.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* There is a possibility that the pointer is null.
* There is a possibility that the string is not correctly null-terminated.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use safer functions. The C11 functions `strlen_s` and `wcslen_s` from annex K handle typical programming errors. +
  Note, however, that they have a runtime overhead and require more code for error handling and therefore are not suited to every case.
* Even if your compiler does not exactly support annex K, you probably have access to similar functions.
* If you are writing {cpp} code, using ``++std::string++`` to manipulate strings is much simpler and less error-prone.


== Sensitive Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
size_t f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strncpy(dest, src, sizeof dest); // Truncation may happen
  return strlen(dest); // Sensitive: "dest" will not be null-terminated if truncation happened
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
size_t f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strncpy(dest, src, sizeof dest); // Truncation may happen
  dest[sizeof dest - 1] = 0;
  return strlen(dest); // Compliant: "dest" is guaranteed to be null-terminated
}
----

Make sure use of "strlen" is safe here.
