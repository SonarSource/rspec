When ``++sizeof++`` is used on a pointer, it returns the size of the pointer (4 or 8 bytes, depending on architecture and OS), not the size of the pointed-to memory area. Therefore, division of that value is not likely to yield what was intended.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
char* message = "hello world";
sizeof(message) / 4; // Noncompliant
