== Why is this an issue?

The ``\[[nodiscard]]`` attribute can be placed on type declarations to indicate that any value of such type should not be discarded when returned from a function. Accompanying the attribute with the message, explaining why values should not be ignored, contributes to a better understanding of code. This is especially important in the case of types, as the reason for which values of the type should not be discarded is a defining property of that type (information about failure, handle owning a scarce resource). 


Moreover, marking a type as ``++nodiscard++``, causes a warning to be reported for invocation of every function that returns this type. As a consequence, the cause of the warning is not directly visible from the declaration of the function and requires further investigation from the user.


This rule raises an issue when ``\[[nodiscard]]`` is used on a type without any explanation.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct [[nodiscard]] status_code {  // Noncompliant
   int code();
};

status_code open(std::string_view path);

int main()
{
   open("/home/user/list.txt");  // warning is raised here
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct [[nodiscard("Possible errors should be checked")]] status_code { 
   int code();
};
----
