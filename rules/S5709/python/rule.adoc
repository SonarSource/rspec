== Why is this an issue?

https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit[``++SystemExit++``] is raised when https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit[``++sys.exit()++``] is called. https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt[``++KeyboardInterrupt++``] is raised when the user asks the program to stop by pressing interrupt keys. Both exceptions are expected to propagate up until the application stops.


In order to avoid catching ``++SystemExit++`` and ``++KeyboardInterrupt++`` by mistake https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/#exception-hierarchy[PEP-352] created the root class ``++BaseException++`` from which ``++SystemExit++``, ``++KeyboardInterrupt++`` and ``++Exception++`` derive. Thus developers can use ``++except Exception:++`` without preventing the software from stopping.


The ``++GeneratorExit++`` class also derives from ``++BaseException++`` as it is not really an error and is not supposed to be caught by user code.


As said in https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException[Python's documentation], user-defined exceptions are not supposed to inherit directly from ``++BaseException++``. They should instead inherit from ``++Exception++`` or one of its subclasses.


This rule raises an issue when a class derives from one of the following exception classes: ``++BaseException++``, ``++KeyboardInterrupt++``, ``++SystemExit++`` or ``++GeneratorExit++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
class MyException(BaseException):  # Noncompliant
    pass

class MyException(GeneratorExit):  # Noncompliant
    pass

class MyException(KeyboardInterrupt):  # Noncompliant
    pass

class MyException(SystemExit):  # Noncompliant
    pass
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
class MyException(Exception):
    pass
----
