== Why is this an issue?

The POM Code Convention is the Maven project's internal recommendation for POM element ordering. It calls for listing modifiers in the following order:


. <modelVersion/>
. <parent/>
. <groupId/>
. <artifactId/>
. <version/>
. <packaging/>
. <name/>
. <description/>
. <url/>
. <inceptionYear/>
. <organization/>
. <licenses/>
. <developers/>
. <contributors/>
. <mailingLists/>
. <prerequisites/>
. <modules/>
. <scm/>
. <issueManagement/>
. <ciManagement/>
. <distributionManagement/>
. <properties/>
. <dependencyManagement/>
. <dependencies/>
. <repositories/>
. <pluginRepositories/>
. <build/>
. <reporting/>
. <profiles/>

Not following this convention has no technical impact, but will reduce the pom's readability because most developers are used to the standard order.
