Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, will not be able to render ``++<object>++`` elements, in such cases it is the content of the ``++<object>++`` which is provided to the user. This alternative content needs to be accessible or the screen readers won't be able to use it. For example, if an ``++<img>++`` is used it must contain an ``++alt++`` attribute (see corresponding rule Web:ImgWithoutAltCheck).


This rule raises an issue when an ``++<object>++`` tag does not have any alternative content.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
<object></object> <!-- Noncompliant -->

<object>
  <object></object> <!-- Noncompliant -->
</object>

== Compliant Solution

----
<object>This application shows the simulation of two particles colliding</object>

<object>
  <img src="flower.png" alt="Flower growing in a pot" />
</object>

<object>
  <object>
    This application shows the simulation of two particles colliding
  </object>
