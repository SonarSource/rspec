== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, `NaN` stands for "Not-a-Number." It is a special value representing a numeric data type that is not a valid number. `NaN` is returned as a result when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function is performed, and the result is undefined or unrepresentable as a valid number.

Comparing a value with `NaN` in JavaScript can be problematic because of the way `NaN` behaves in comparison operations. The reason is that `NaN` is not equal to any value, including itself, and this behavior can lead to unexpected results.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const a = NaN;

if (a === NaN) { // Noncompliant: Always false
  console.log("a is not a number"); // This is dead code
}

if (a !== NaN) { // Noncompliant: Always true
  console.log("a is not NaN"); // This statement is not necessarily true
}
----

To check if a value is `NaN`, you should use the `isNaN()` function:

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const a = NaN;

if (isNaN(a)) {
  console.log("a is not a number");
}

if (!isNaN(a)) {
  console.log("a is not NaN");
}
----

Keep in mind that `isNaN()` can be a bit quirky since it tries to convert its argument into a number before checking if it is `NaN`. If the argument cannot be converted into a number, `isNaN()` will return true, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

As an alternative, you can use the `Number.isNaN()` method to perform a strict check for `NaN` without any type conversion:

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const a = NaN;

if (Number.isNaN(a)) {
  console.log("a is not a number");
}

if (!Number.isNaN(a)) {
  console.log("a is not NaN");
}
----
