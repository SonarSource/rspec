== Why is this an issue?

`NaN` is not equal to anything, even itself. Testing for equality or inequality against `NaN` will yield predictable results, but probably not the ones you want. 

Instead, the best way to see whether a variable is equal to `NaN` is to use `Number.isNaN()`, since ES2015, or (perhaps counter-intuitively) to compare it to itself. Since `NaN !== NaN`, when `a !== a`, you know it must equal `NaN`.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
var a = NaN;

if (a === NaN) {  // Noncompliant; always false
  console.log("a is not a number");  // this is dead code
}
if (a !== NaN) { // Noncompliant; always true
  console.log("a is not NaN"); // this statement is not necessarily true
}
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (Number.isNaN(a)) { 
  console.log("a is not a number");
}
if (!Number.isNaN(a)) {
  console.log("a is not NaN"); 
}

Use a test of the format "a [!==|!=|==|===] a" instead.
