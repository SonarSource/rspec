\[~nicolas.harraudeau] - the https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-clang/blob/master/src/core/analyzers/ControlCharacterCheck.cpp#L73[CPP implementation] looks at \n, \t, \r, 0, nonBreakableSpaceCharacterCode in combination with other characters and at characters with code < 32.


On the other side, https://discuss.sonarsource.com/t/new-rule-multiple-language-remove-invisible-characters-from-your-string/512/5[this internal discussion] mentions all invisible spaces characters.


I guess we should aim for invisible spaces, right? And mention that in the RSPEC? Update the rule name (instead of control character, also invisible space?)
