== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces the "spaceship" ``++operator<=>++`` that replaces all the other comparison operators in most cases. When this operator is defined, the compiler can rewrite expressions using ``++<++``, ``++<=++``, ``++>++`` and ``++>=++`` to use this operator instead. This presents three advantages:

* Less code to write (and therefore fewer bugs, too),
* Guaranteed consistency between all the comparison operators (for instance, in this situation, ``++a < b++`` and ``++!(a >= b)++`` will always return the same value).
* Guaranteed symmetry for comparisons: if you can write ``++a < b++``, and that operation is resolved through ``++operator<=>++``, you can also write ``++b < a++``, and get a consistent result. Achieving the same result with classical comparison operators requires twice as many overloads if ``++a++`` and ``++b++`` have different types.

Additionally, if the ``++operator<=>++`` has the defaulted implementation, the compiler can implicitly generate a defaulted implementation of `operator==`, simplifying the class definition one step further.


Before {cpp}20, it was common to provide only ``++operator<++`` for a class and ask the users of this class to write all their code only using this operator (this is what ``++std::map++`` requires of its key type, for instance). In this case, it is still advised to replace the operator with ``++<=>++``: the quantity of required work is similar, and users of the class will benefit from a much greater expressivity.


== How to fix it

This rule reports user-provided comparison operators (member functions or free functions) ``++<++``, ``++<=++``, ``++>++`` and ``++>=++`` that could be replaced by defining the ``++operator<=>++``.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class A { // Noncompliant: defines operator< that can be replaced with operator<=>
  int field;
  public:
    bool operator<(const A& other) const {
      return field < other.field;
    }
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class A {
  int field;
  public:
    auto operator<=>(const A& other) const = default;
    // Note that here, operator == will be implicitly defaulted
};
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class B;

class C { // Noncompliant: defines 12 comparison operators that can be replaced with 2 operators
  int field;
  public:
    bool operator==(const B&) const;
    bool operator!=(const B&) const;
    bool operator<=(const B&) const;
    bool operator<(const B&) const;
    bool operator>=(const B&) const;
    bool operator>(const B&) const;
    friend bool operator==(const B&, const C&);
    friend bool operator!=(const B&, const C&);
    friend bool operator<=(const B&, const C&);
    friend bool operator<(const B&, const C&);
    friend bool operator>=(const B&, const C&);
    friend bool operator>(const B&, const C&);
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
class B;

class C { // Compliant. the same comparisons are possible as with the 12 operators
  int field;
  public:
    auto operator<=>(const B&) const;
    auto operator==(const B&) const;
};
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
enum class MyEnum {low = 1, high = 2};

bool operator<(MyEnum lhs, MyEnum rhs) { // Noncompliant: can be replaced with operator<=>
    return static_cast<int>(lhs) < static_cast<int>(rhs);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
enum class MyEnum {low = 1, high = 2};

auto operator<=>(MyEnum lhs, MyEnum rhs) {
    return static_cast<int>(lhs) <=> static_cast<int>(rhs);
}
----
