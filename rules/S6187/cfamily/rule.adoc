== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces the "spaceship" ``++operator<=>++`` that replaces all the other comparison operators in most cases. When this operator is defined, the compiler can rewrite expressions using ``++<++``, ``++<=++``, ``++>++`` and ``++>=++`` to use this operator instead. This presents three advantages: 

* Less code to write (and therefore fewer bugs too),
* Guaranteed consistency between all the comparison operators (for instance, in this situation, ``++a < b++`` and ``++!(a >= b)++`` will always return the same value).
* Guaranteed symmetry for comparisons: If you can write ``++a<b++``, and that operation is resolved through ``++operator<=>++``, you can also write ``++b<a++``, and get a consistent result. Achieving the same result with classical comparison operators require to double the number overloads if ``++a++`` and ``++b++`` are of different types. 

Additionally, if the ``++operator<=>++`` has the defaulted implementation, the compiler can also implicitly generate a defaulted implementation of operator==, simplifying the class definition one step further.


Before {cpp}20, if was common to provide only ``++operator<++`` for a class, and ask the user of this class to write all his code only using this operator (this is what ``++std::map++`` requires of its key type, for instance). It is still advised in this case to replace the operator with ``++<=>++``: The quantity of required work is similar, and the user of the class will benefit from a much greater expressivity.


This rule reports user-provided comparison operators (member functions or free functions) ``++<++``, ``++<=++``, ``++>++`` and ``++>=++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class A { // Noncompliant: defines operator< that can be replaced with operator<=>
  int field;
  public:
    bool operator<(const A& other) const {
      return field < other.field;
    }
};
class C;
class B { // Noncompliant: defines 12 comparison operators that can be replaced with 2 operators
  int field;
  public:
    bool operator==(const C&) const;
    bool operator!=(const C&) const;
    bool operator<=(const C&) const;
    bool operator<(const C&) const;
    bool operator>=(const C&) const;
    bool operator>(const C&) const;
    friend bool operator==(const C&, const B&);
    friend bool operator!=(const C&, const B&);
    friend bool operator<=(const C&, const B&);
    friend bool operator<(const C&, const B&);
    friend bool operator>=(const C&, const B&);
    friend bool operator>(const C&, const B&);
};

enum class MyEnum {low = 1, high = 2};
bool operator<(MyEnum lhs, MyEnum rhs) { // Noncompliant: can be replaced with operator<=>
    return static_cast<int>(lhs) < static_cast<int>(rhs);
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class A {
  int field;
  public:
    auto operator<=>(const A& other) const = default;
    // Note that here, operator == will be implicitly defaulted
};
class B { // Compliant. the same comparisons are possible as with the 12 operators
  int field;
  public:
    auto operator<=>(const C&) const;
    auto operator==(const C&) const;
};

enum class MyEnum {low = 1, high = 2};
auto operator<=>(MyEnum lhs, MyEnum rhs) {
    return static_cast<int>(lhs) <=> static_cast<int>(rhs);
}
