Since integers are usually represented in binary form in computers, it is efficient to check if a given number is a power of two by checking if its  ``++unsigned++`` representation has a single bit set.


In {cpp} such check could be expressed as ``++x & (x-1) == 0++``. However, the intent of this expression is unclear. Furthermore, it requires to take special care for the value ``++0++``, which would pass the above check, while not having any bit set and not being a power of two.


This check can be expressed more clearly with the ``++std::has_single_bit++`` function template, introduced in {cpp}20.


This rule reports computations that could be replaced with ``++std::has_single_bit++`` .


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void f(unsigned x) {
  if ((x > 0) && !(x & (x-1))) { // Noncompliant
    // Special algorithm for powers of 2
  }
  // Normal algorithm
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void f(unsigned x) {
  if (std::has_single_bit(x)) {
    // Special algorithm for powers of 2
  }
  // Normal algorithm
}
