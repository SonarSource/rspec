== Why is this an issue?

The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size or length is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,go]
----
if len(myArr) >= 0 { ... } // Noncompliant: always true

var result = len(myArr) >= 0 // Noncompliant: always true
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,go]
----
if len(myArr) < 0 { ... } // Noncompliant: always false
----

Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.
