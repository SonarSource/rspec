== Why is this an issue?

The count of elements from an array or Countable object is always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,php]
----
if (count($arr) >= 0) {...} // Noncompliant: always true

$result = count($arr) >= 0; // Noncompliant always true
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,php]
----
if (count($arr) < 0) {...} // Noncompliant: always false
----

Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.

=== Message

The count of an array or Countable is always ">=0", so update this test to either "==0" or ">0".
