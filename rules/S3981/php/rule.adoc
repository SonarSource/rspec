== Why is this an issue?

The count of elements from an array or Countable object is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that the count is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the object or array instead. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
if (count($arr) >= 0) { ... }

if (count($arr) < 0) { ... }

$result = count($arr) >= 0;

if (0 > count($arr)) { ... }
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
if (count($arr) != 0) { ... }

if (count($arr) > 0) { ... }
----

=== Message

The count of an array or Countable is always ">=0", so update this test to either "==0" or ">0".
