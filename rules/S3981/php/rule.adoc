== Why is this an issue?

The count of elements from an array or Countable object is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that the count is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,php]
----
if (count($arr) >= 0) { // Noncompliant always true
  ...
}

if (count($arr) < 0) { // Noncompliant always false
  ...
}

$result = count($arr) >= 0; // Noncompliant always true
----

Either remove the redundant code if the current behavior is correct or fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent.
