== Why is this an issue?

The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,javascript]
----
if (someSet.size >= 0) {...} // Noncompliant always true

const result = someArray.length >= 0;  // Noncompliant always true
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,javascript]
----
if (someMap.size < 0) {...} // Noncompliant always false
----

Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.
