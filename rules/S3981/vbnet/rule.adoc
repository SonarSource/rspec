== Why is this an issue?

The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,vbnet]
----
If Collection.Count >= 0 Then ... 'Noncompliant always true

If array.Length >= 0 Then ... 'Noncompliant always true
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,vbnet]
----
If Enumerable.Count < 0 Then ... 'Noncompliant always false

Dim result As Boolean = Array.Length >= 0 'Noncompliant always true
----
Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.
