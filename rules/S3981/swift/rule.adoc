== Why is this an issue?

The number of elements in a collection, an array or a string are always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,swift]
----
if (myArray.count >= 0) { ... } // Noncompliant always true
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,swift]
----
if (myString.characters.count < 0) { ... } // Noncompliant always false
----

Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.
