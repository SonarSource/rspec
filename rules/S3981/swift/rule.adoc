== Why is this an issue?

The number of elements in a collection, an array or a string are always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size or length is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness instead. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
if (myArray.count >= 0) { ... }

if (myString.characters.count < 0) { ... }
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,swift]
----
if (myArray.isEmpty) { ... }

if (myString.isEmpty) { ... }
----
