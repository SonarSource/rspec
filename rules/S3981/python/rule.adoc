The length of a collection is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a length is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the collection instead. 

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
mylist = []
if len(myList) >= 0:  # Noncompliant
    pass

if len(myList) < 0:  # Noncompliant
    pass
----

== Compliant Solution

----
mylist = []
if len(myList) >= 42:
    pass

if len(myList) == 0:
    pass
