== Why is this an issue?

The length of a collection is always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,python]
----
mylist = []
if len(myList) >= 0:  # Noncompliant: always true
    pass
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,python]
if len(myList) < 0:  # Noncompliant: always false
    pass
----

Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.
