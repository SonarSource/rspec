== Why is this an issue?

The length of a collection is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a length is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,python]
----
mylist = []
if len(myList) >= 0:  # Noncompliant always true
    pass

if len(myList) < 0:  # Noncompliant always false
    pass

Either remove the redundant code if the current behavior is correct or fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent.
