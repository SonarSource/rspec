The size of a collection or an array is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always `true`. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return `false`. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the collection or array instead.
