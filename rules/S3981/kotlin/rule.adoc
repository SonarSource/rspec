== Why is this an issue?

The size of a collection or an array is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always `true`. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return `false`.

[source,text]
----
if (myList.size >= 0) { // Noncompliant always true
  ...
}

if (myList.size < 0) { // Noncompliant always false
  ...
}

boolean result = myArray.size >= 0; // Noncompliant always true
----

Either remove the redundant code if the current behavior is correct or fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent.
