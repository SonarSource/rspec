== Why is this an issue?

The size of a collection or an array is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size is greater than or equal to zero doesn't make sense, since the result is always `true`. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return `false`. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the collection or array instead.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,kotlin]
----
if (myList.size >= 0) { ... }

if (myList.size < 0) { ... }

boolean result = myArray.size >= 0;

if (0 > myArray.size) { ... }
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,kotlin]
----
if (!myList.isEmpty()) { ... }

if (myArray.size >= 42) { ... }
----
