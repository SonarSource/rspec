== Why is this an issue?

The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn't make sense, since the result is always ``++true++``.

[source,java]
----
if (myList.size() >= 0) {...} // Noncompliant: always true

boolean result = myArray.length >= 0; // Noncompliant: true
----

Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return ``++false++``.

[source,java]
----
if (myList.size() < 0) {...} // Noncompliant: always false
----

Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.
