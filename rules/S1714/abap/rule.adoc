Extract datasets, also known as extracts, are global data structures with no fixed internal format. Because their use leads to unstructured programming, and because they have been declared obsolete by SAP, extracts should not be used. Internal tables should be used instead.


This rule allows you to detect extracts and their related syntax, including uses of ``++SORT++`` and ``++AT++`` without a table name, ``++LOOP++`` without ``++AT++``, ``++FIELD-GROUPS++``, and ``++EXTRACT++`` itself.
