== Why is this an issue?

The point of calling ``++notify++``, or more prefereably ``++notifyAll++``, is to alert other threads that the state of ``++this++`` object has changed. Doing so without a state change seems pointless, and may indicate a logic error.


=== Noncompliant code example

public void run(){
  synchronized(this){
    int total = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<100 ; i++){
      total += i;
    }
    notify();  // Noncompliant; only local variables have been modified. What's the point?
  }
}
