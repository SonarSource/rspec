== Why is this an issue?

Since {cpp}11, raw string literals can be used to avoid the need to escape characters in a string.


This rules raises an issue when using a raw string literal would make a string easier to read. For instance, when a non-raw string contains different escaped sequences (among  ``++\'++``, ``++\\++``, ``++\"++`` and ``++\?++``) or more than two of the same kind.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
const auto* result = "a\?b \""; // Noncompliant
const auto* regEx = "\\\\(\\\\.\\\\)"; // Noncompliant
const auto* message = "Use \"x\" or \"y\""; // Noncompliant
const auto* rawLit = R"(Hello!)" ...)"; // Noncompliant, literal contains closing sequence
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
const auto* result = R"(a?b ")";
const auto* regEx = R"(\\(\\.\\))";
const auto* message = R"(Use "x" or "y")";
const auto* rawLit = R"_(Hello!)" ...)_"; // Compliant, uses delimiter whose closing sequence does not appear in the literal

const auto* twoLines = "one\r\ntwo"; // Compliant, contains \r 
const auto* path = "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office16\\";  // Compliant, raw strings would not improve readability
----


=== Exceptions

To preserve readability, this rule ignores strings containing only one character and strings with escaped whitespace or non-printable characters:

* Non-printable characters: ``++\a++`` ``++\b++`` ``++\f++`` ``++\v++`` ``++\nnn++`` ``++\xnn++`` ``++\unnnn++`` ``++\Unnnnnnnn++``
* Tab: ``++\t++``
* Carriage return: ``++\r++``
