== Why is this an issue?

A _requires-expression_ is a list of requirements that can be of different natures. _Simple-requirements_ are expressions that do not start with the keyword `requires` and _compound-requirements_ are expressions surrounded by curly brackets potentially followed by a `noexcept` specification and return type requirements.

In both cases, the expressions are not evaluated. They will only be checked for validity, and if the expression is invalid, the _requires-expression_ evaluates to `false`.

When we write a concept check or a type predicate, the intent is usually to evaluate them, therefore, they donâ€™t really belong in a _simple-requirement_ or a _compound-requirement_. Instead, they should either be used directly in a concept definition (outside of a _requires-expression_) or, less often, as a _nested-requirement_ (a requirement introduced by the `requires` keyword within the _requires-expression_).

This rule detects concept checks and standard type predicates (from the header `<type_traits>`) in single and compound requirements of _requires-expressions_.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T>
concept TriviallyCopyable = requires {
   std::copyable<T>;  // Noncompliant
   {std::is_trivally_copy_constructible_v<T>}; // Noncompliant
   std::is_trivally_move_constructible<T>::value; // Noncompliant
};
----
This concept is always `true`, for every type `T`, because expressions such as `std::copyable<T>` are always well-formed.

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T>
concept TriviallyCopyable =  
    std::copyable<T> && 
    std::is_trivially_copy_constructible_v<T> &&
    std::is_trivially_move_constructible<T>::value;
----
Or:
[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T>
concept TriviallyCopyable = requires {
   requires std::copyable<T>;
   requires std::is_trivially_copy_constructible_v<T> &&
       std::is_trivially_move_constructible<T>::value;
};
----
