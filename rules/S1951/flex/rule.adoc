The ``++trace()++`` function outputs debug statements, which can be read by anyone with a debug version of the Flash player. Because sensitive information could easily be exposed in this manner, ``++trace()++`` should never appear in production code.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
    var val:Number = doCalculation();
    trace("Calculation result: " + val);  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
    var val:Number = doCalculation();
----
