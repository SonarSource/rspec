References and pointers to temporary objects become dangling after these objects are destroyed.
Barring lifetime extension, this happens at the end of a full expression.

Lifetime extension allows even after the end of a full expression the use  of
the temporaries that are bound to `const` references but only if they are bound directly.

== Why is this an issue?

You can create a temporary object as part of evaluation of an expression.

For example:

[source,cpp]
----
int getOffset(int i) {
  int x = std::vector{10, 20, 30}[i] / (i + 1);
  return x +std::stoi("15");
}
----

The code above contains two full expressions (declaration of `i` and `return`), each contains a temporary:

- `std::vector{10, 20, 30}` is a temporary vector created in-place, and accessed directly.
- `"15"` is implicitly converted to temporary `std::string{"15"}` because `std::stoi` accepts `std::string const&` as an argument.

A temporary object remains valid throughout the single full expression where it was created.
It is reclaimed and destroyed (for nontrivial objects) at the end of it.

If after the end of a full expression some refrences or pointers still refer to a temporary object
they immediately become dangling, unless the lifetime of the temporary object is extended (see <<Exceptions>>).

Dereferencing and even copying such dangling pointer or reference causes *undefined behavior*.

=== Exceptions [[exceptions]]

A reference-to-`const` bound to a temporary object directly extends lifetime of this object.
The object enjoys the same lifetime as the reference it is bound to.

However, lifetime extension is not transitive.
If the definition of the temporary relies on another temporary,
this second temporary will still be destroyed at the end of the full expression,
creating an immediately dangling reference.

=== What is the potential impact?

Accessing a dangling reference or pointer causes undefined behavior.
This means the compiler is not bound by the language standard anymore and your program has no meaning assigned to it.

Practially this has wide range of effects.
In many cases the access works by accident and succeeds at writing or reading a value.
However, it can start misbehaving at anytime.
If compilation flags, compiler, platform, or runtime environment change,
the same code can crash the application, corrupt memory, or leak a secret.

== How to fix it

You can either copy the temporary object immediately,
allocate it on the stack (as a local variable),
on the heap, or as a static object.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <vector>
#include <optional>

int f(int i) {
  // r-value references can also be dangling
  int &&rval = *std::optional<int>(i);  // Noncompliant: rval is an immediately dangling reference
  return rval; // dereferencing a dangline reference
}

int main() {
    // the vector is a temporary object,
    // and binding a reference to its first element will not extend the vector lifetime
    auto const &val = std::vector{1, 2, 3}[0]; // Noncompliant: val is an immediately dangling reference
    return f(val);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <vector>
#include <optional>

int f(int i) {
  int rval = *std::optional<int>(i);  // Compliant, rval copies the temporary
  return rval;
}

auto const commonIndexValues = std::vector{1, 2, 3};

int main() {
    auto const &val = commonIndexValues[0]; // Compliant, v is a global constant
    return f(val);
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <vector>

class Stats {
    std::vector<int> playerScores;
  public:
    std::vector<int> const& getPlayerScores() const {
      return playerScores;
    }
};

Stats getStats();

int getTotalScore() {
  int sum = 0;
  // getStats() returns a temporary the is reclaimed before the loop begins
  // Even though internally the range-based for loop takes a const reference to a subobject of a temporary,
  // it is not lifetime-extended, because the subobject reference is obtained indirectly
  for (auto score : getStats().getPlayerScores()) { // Noncompliant
    sum += score;
  }
  return sum;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <vector>

class Stats {
    std::vector<int> playerScores;
  public:
    std::vector<int> const& getPlayerScores() const {
      return playerScores;
    }
};

Stats getStats();

int getTotalScore() {
  int sum = 0;
  // stats is not a temporary and it is alive throughout the loop
  for (auto stats = getStats(); auto score : stats.getPlayerScores()) { // Compliant
    sum += score;
  }
  return sum;
}
----

Alternatively, you can rely on lifetime extension, if you are accessing the field directly:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <vector>

class Stats {
  public:
    std::vector<int> playerScores;
};

Stats getStats();

int getTotalScore() {
  int sum = 0;
  // the temporary Stats is lifetime extended for the duration of the loop
  // because a hidden const reference is bound to its field Stats::playerScores
  for (auto score : getStats().playerScores) { // Compliant
    sum += score;
  }
  return sum;
}
----

Another option, is to overload the `getPlayerScores` member function to
"consume" the temporary and return an independent temporary with its own
lifetime that can be extended:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <vector>

class Stats {
    std::vector<int> playerScores;
  public:
    std::vector<int> const& getPlayerScores() const {
      return playerScores;
    }
    std::vector<int> getPlayerScores() && { // Note the && at the end
      return std::move(playerScores);
    }
};

Stats getStats();

int getTotalScore() {
  int sum = 0;
  // Now, the second overload of getPlayerScores() is used, and it
  // returns another temporary that can be lifetime extended.
  for (auto score : getStats().getPlayerScores()) { // Compliant
    sum += score;
  }
  return sum;
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <string>
#include <memory>
struct MyStrRef {
  std::shared_ptr<std::string const> target;
  MyStrRef(std::string const& target):target (&target) {}
};

void f(Wrapper const& w) {
  MyStrRef x(std::string{"string"}); // Noncompliant
  std::cout <<*x.target; // Dereferencing a dangling pointer
}
----

==== Compliant solution

You can store the temporary as a global, static, or local variable, or on the heap.
For the completeness sake, let us put the string on the heap:

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <string>
#include <memory>
struct MyStrRef {
  std::shared_ptr<std::string const> target;
  MyStrRef(std::shared_ptr<std::string const> target):target (&target) {}
};

void f(Wrapper const& w) {
  auto s = std::make_shared<std::string>("string");
  MyStrRef x(s); // Compliant
  std::cout <<*x.target;
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <string>
class Wrapper {
    std::string contents;
  public:
    std::string const& getOr(std::string const& backup) const {
      return contents.empty() ? backup : contents;
    }
};

void f(Wrapper const& w) {
  // If w.contents is empty, c will be a dangling reference to a former std::string{"<empty>"}
  auto const& c = w.getOr("<empty>"); // Noncompliant
  std::cout <<c <<std::endl;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <string>
class Wrapper {
    std::string contents;
  public:
    std::string const& getOr(std::string const& backup) const {
      return contents.empty() ? backup : contents;
    }
};

void f(Wrapper const& w) {
  std::string c = w.getOr("<empty>"); // Compliant, c is an independent copy
  std::cout <<c <<std::endl;
}
----

== Going the extra mile

The interface of `Wrapper::getOr` from the example above is dangerous,
since it is bound to create subtle bugs.
Instead of fixing every call, it is better to make the interface less error-prone.

For example, always return the `std::string` by value.

[source,cpp]
----
  std::string Wrapper::getOr(std::string backup) const {
    return contents.empty() ? backup : contents;
  }
----

There is no reference involved, so no risk of having it dangling.

This safer solution, does involve some performance overhead of potentially unncessarily
copying the `w.contents` string but in many cases it is acceptable.

Alternatively, you can use `std::string_view` (or the equivalent if you can't use {cpp}17)
to make this interface more efficient:

[source,cpp]
----
  std::string_view Wrapper::getOr(std::string_view backup) const {
    return contents.empty() ? backup : contents;
  }
----

In this case, `w.getOr("str")` creates and passes `std::string_view` by value,
and the temporary `std::string_view` stores a pointer to the string literal `"str"`.
When `getOr` returns `contents` it copies the `backup` value, which is fast,
and the result is copied to a variable in the caller's stack frame.

Note, that the interface is only slightly safer.
The following code would still create a dangling pointer
because it creates a temporary `std::string`
and the `std::string_view` refers to this temporary object
that gets destroyed at the end of the full expression:

[source,cpp]
----
std::string_view c = w.getOr(std::string{"str"}); // Noncompliant
std::cout <<c <<std::endl; // c refers to a the memory formerly occupied by temporary string
----

\[~amelie.renard]: From the example, you seem to want to report at the place the immediately dangling reference is used, not at the place it is created. I think this is significantly more complex, for little added value (anyways, the place to correct is probably the creation place). I changed it. One consequence is the possibility of "true" false positives, if the reference is created, but never used. But this is probably an uncommon pattern, and at least a pitfall.

I also changed some wording, can you review?
