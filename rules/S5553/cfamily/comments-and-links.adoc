\[~amelie.renard]: From the example, you seem to want to report at the place the immediately dangling reference is used, not at the place it is created. I think this is significantly more complex, for little added value (anyways, the place to correct is probably the creation place). I changed it. One consequence is the possibility of "true" false positives, if the reference is created, but never used. But this is probably an uncommon pattern, and at least a pitfall.

I also changed some wording, can you review?
