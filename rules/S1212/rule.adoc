A source code comply to an architectural model when it fully adheres to a set of architectural constraints. A constraint allows to deny references between classes by pattern.


You can for instance use this rule to :


* forbid access to ``++**.web.**++`` from ``++**.dao.**++`` classes
* forbid access to ``++java.util.Vector++``, ``++java.util.Hashtable++`` and ``++java.util.Enumeration++`` from any classes
* forbid access to ``++java.sql.**++`` from ``++**.ui.**++`` and ``++**.web.**++`` classes
