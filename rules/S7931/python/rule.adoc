This rule raises an issue when `NotImplemented` is used in a boolean context, such as in `if` statements, logical operations, or explicit boolean conversion.

== Why is this an issue?

Starting with Python 3.14, using `NotImplemented` in boolean contexts raises a `TypeError`. This change was introduced to prevent confusion and bugs that could arise from the implicit boolean evaluation of `NotImplemented`.

Previously, `NotImplemented` would evaluate to `True` in boolean contexts, which could lead to unexpected behavior in code that was meant to check whether an operation was actually implemented. The `NotImplemented` singleton is specifically designed to be returned by binary special methods (like `++__eq__++`, `++__lt__++`, etc.) to indicate that the operation is not supported for the given operand types, and should be compared explicitly using identity checks.

This breaking change was preceded by a `DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.9, giving developers time to update their code. The change ensures that `NotImplemented` is used correctly and prevents subtle bugs in comparison operations and other contexts where boolean evaluation might occur unintentionally.

=== What is the potential impact?

Code using `NotImplemented` in boolean contexts will raise a `TypeError` at runtime in Python 3.14 and later versions. This can cause application crashes and unexpected behavior. The impact is particularly significant for libraries implementing custom comparison operators or arithmetic operations that return `NotImplemented` and then check its value incorrectly.

=== How to fix?


Replace boolean evaluation of `NotImplemented` with explicit identity checks using `is` or `is not`. This clearly expresses the intent to check whether the operation was implemented.

----
def __eq__(self, other):
    result = NotImplemented
    if result:  # Noncompliant
        return True
    return False

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
def __eq__(self, other):
    result = NotImplemented
    if result is not NotImplemented:
        return True
    return False
