==== SSL encryption for HTTP requests
With basic authentication, user credentials are transmitted in plain text, which makes them vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. However, when HTTPS is employed, the data is encrypted before transmission, making it significantly more difficult for attackers to intercept and decipher the credentials. If no other form of authentication is possible for this code, then every request must be sent over HTTPS to ensure credentials are kept safe.
