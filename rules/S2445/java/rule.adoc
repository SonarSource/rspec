== Why is this an issue?

Synchronizing on a class field synchronizes not on the field itself, but on the object assigned to it. So synchronizing on a non-``++final++`` field makes it possible for the field's value to change while a thread is in a block synchronized on the old value. That would allow a second thread, synchronized on the new value, to enter the block at the same time.

The story is very similar for synchronizing on parameters; two different threads running the method in parallel could pass two different object instances in to the method as parameters, completely undermining the synchronization.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
private String color = "red";

private void doSomething(){
  synchronized(color) {  // Noncompliant; lock is actually on object instance "red" referred to by the color variable
    //...
    color = "green"; // other threads now allowed into this block
    // ...
  }
  synchronized(new Object()) { // Noncompliant this is a no-op.
     // ...
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
private String color = "red";
private final Object lockObj = new Object();

private void doSomething(){
  synchronized(lockObj) {
    //...
    color = "green";
    // ...
  }
}

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

"xxx" is not "private final", and should not be used for synchronization.

"xxx" is a method parameter, and should not be used for synchronization.

Synchronizing on a new instance is a no-op.

=== Highlighting

``++synchronize xxx++``
