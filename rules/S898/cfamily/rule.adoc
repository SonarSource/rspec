== Why is this an issue?

Technically known as a DU dataflow anomaly, this is a process whereby a variable is given a value that is subsequently never used. At best this is inefficient, but may indicate a genuine problem. Often the presence of these constructs is due to the wrong choice of statement aggregates such as loops.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int16_t critical ( int16_t i, int16_t j )
{
  int16_t result = 0; // Noncompliant, the value assigned to result is never read
  result = 12;
  int16_t k = ( 3 * i ) + ( j * j );
  if ( f2 ( ) )
  {
    // k will only be tested here if f2 returns true
    // Initialization of k could be moved here
    if ( k > 0 )
    {
      throw ( 42 );
    }
  }
  // Noncompliant, value of k not used if f2 ( ) returns false
  return ( result );
}

void unusedvalue ( int16_t arr[ 20 ] )
{
  int16_t j;
  j = 2;
  for ( int16_t i = 1; i < 10; i++ )
  {
    arr[ i ] = arr[ j ];
    j++; // Non-compliant, the value assigned to j on the final loop is never used.
  }
}

void nounusedvalue ( int16_t arr[ 20 ] )
{
  for ( int16_t i = 1; i < 10; i++ )
  {
    arr[ i ] = arr[ i + 2 ];
  }
}

=== Exceptions

Loop control variables are exempt from this rule.
