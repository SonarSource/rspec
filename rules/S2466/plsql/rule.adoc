== Why is this an issue?

Always having a ``++RETURN++`` as the last statement in a function is a good practice as it prevents the ``++ORA-06503 PL/SQL: Function returned without value++`` error.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
CREATE FUNCTION incorrectFunction RETURN PLS_INTEGER IS -- Non-Compliant
BEGIN
   NULL; -- This function was expected to return a PLS_INTEGER, but did not. Will lead to ORA-06503
END;
/

BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Ret = ' || incorrectFunction2); -- ORA-06503 PL/SQL: Function returned without value
END;
/

DROP FUNCTION incorrectFunction;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
CREATE FUNCTION correctFunction RETURN PLS_INTEGER IS -- Compliant
BEGIN
  RETURN 42;
END;
/

DROP FUNCTION correctFunction;
