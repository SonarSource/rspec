== Why is this an issue?

React props should read-only because it helps enforce the principle of immutability in React components. By making props read-only, you ensure that the data passed from a parent component to a child component cannot be modified directly by the child component. This helps maintain a clear data flow and prevents unexpected side effects.

If props were mutable, child components could modify the props directly, leading to unpredictable behavior and making it harder to track down bugs. By enforcing read-only props, React promotes a more predictable and maintainable codebase. Additionally, read-only props enable performance optimizations in React's rendering process by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of components.

Overall, enforcing read-only props in React helps improve code reliability, maintainability, and performance.

== How to fix it in Flow.js

You should use Flow.js's modifier `+` to mark your component props as read-only.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
type Props = {
  name: string, // Noncompliant: 'name' is mutable
}
class Welcome extends React.Component<Props> {
  render () {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
type Props = {
  +name: string,
}
class Welcome extends React.Component<Props> {
  render () {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
----

== How to fix it in TypeScript

You should use TypeScript's modifier `readonly` to mark your component props as read-only.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
type Props = {
  name: string; // Noncompliant: 'name' is mutable
}
class Welcome extends React.Component<Props> {
  render () {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
type Props = {
  readonly name: string;
}
class Welcome extends React.Component<Props> {
  render () {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
----
