Function declarations should be used, instead of variables.

== Why is this an issue?

Dart has https://dart.dev/language/functions#functions-as-first-class-objects[built-in support for functions], meaning that they can be assigned to variables like any other type.

However, this leads to two ways of defining functions: 

* function declarations, both in top-level and nested scopes
* and function expressions assigned to variables, which can be library-level variables or local ones

The second way allows to redefine the function behavior after first assignment, by simply reassigning the variable to a new function expression. When this is not the case, the function expression should be replaced with a function declaration, to make the code more readable and consistent.

=== Exceptions

Top-level variables are allowed, since they can change their value over time.

[source,dart]
----
typedef StringRetriever = String Function(Map<String, String> data);  
StringRetriever currentRetriever = (data) => '';
----

However, top-level `final` variables are not allowed, since their value cannot change once initialized. Therefore, there is no reason not to define them as function expressions.

[source,dart]
----
final StringRetriever currentRetriever = (data) => ''; // Noncompliant
----

Nested function variables, on the other hand, are always considered non-compliant, whether they are `final` or not, but only if their values is not mutated.

[source,dart]
----
void main() {
    StringRetriever mutableRetriever = (data) => ''; // Noncompliant
    final StringRetriever immutableRetriever = (data) => ''; // Noncompliant

    var nestedFunctionVariable = () { }; // Compliant
    nestedFunctionVariable = () { print('Hi'); };
}
----

The same applies to class fields (instance and static):

[source,dart]
----
class AClass {
  final StringRetriever immutableFunctionField = (data) => ''; // Noncompliant
  StringRetriever mutableFunctionField = (data) => ''; // Compliant

  static final StringRetriever immutableStaticFunctionField = (data) => ''; // Noncompliant
  static StringRetriever mutableStaticFunctionField = (data) => ''; // Compliant 
}
----

== How to fix it

Replace the variable assignment with a function declaration that:

* has the same name as the variable being replaced
* has the same parameters as the function expression assigned to the variable
* has the same return type as the function expression assigned to the variable

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void myFunction(String prefix) {
    var printStrings = (String s1, String s2) {
        print('$prefix: $s1[${s1.length}] $s2[${s2.length}]');
    };

    printStrings('Hello', 'World');
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void myFunction(String prefix) {
    void printStrings(String s1, String s2) {
        print('$prefix: $s1[${s1.length}] $s2[${s2.length}]');
    }

    printStrings('Hello', 'World');
}

=== Message

* Use a function declaration rather than a variable assignment to bind a function to a name.

=== Highlighting

The entire assignment, including the body of the function expression assigned to the variable: e.g. `currentRetriever = (data) => ''`.
