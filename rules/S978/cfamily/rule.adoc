== Why is this an issue?

Defining or declaring identifiers with reserved names may lead to undefined behavior. Similarly, defining macros, variables or functions/methods with the same names as functions from the C standard library is likely to lead to unexpected results. 


Additionally, such identifiers have the potential to thoroughly confuse people who are unfamiliar with the code base, possibly leading them to introduce additional errors. Therefore reserved words and the names of C standard library functions should not be used as identifiers.


This rule applies to:

* ``++defined++``
* C standard library function names
* identifiers that contain two consecutive underscores
* identifiers that begin with an underscore, followed by an uppercase letter
* identifiers in the global namespace that start with an underscore


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#ifndef _MY_FILE
#define _MY_FILE   // Noncompliant: starts with '_'

#define FIELD__VAL(field) ##field // Noncompliant: contains "__"

int free(void *pArg, int len) {  // Noncompliant: free is a standard function
  int __i; // Noncompliant: starts with "__"
  //...
}
#endif
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#ifndef MY_FILE
#define MY_FILE

#define FIELD_VAL(field) ##field

int clean(void *pArg, int len) {
  int i;
  //...
}
#endif
----

\[~amelie.renard]: I changed the rule to make it consistent with [lex.name] in the standard. Can you check?
