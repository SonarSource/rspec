== Why is this an issue?

Defining or declaring identifiers with reserved names may lead to undefined behavior. Therefore, reserved names should not be used as identifiers.

This rule applies to:

* ``++defined++``
* identifiers that contain two consecutive underscores
* identifiers that begin with an underscore, followed by an uppercase letter
* identifiers in the global namespace that start with an underscore

== How to fix it

Rename the identifier to a name that is not reserved

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#if defined _MY_FILE
#define _MY_FILE  // Noncompliant: starts with '_', followed by an uppercase letter

#define FIELD__VAL(field) ##field  // Noncompliant: contains "__"

const bool defined = false;  // Noncompliant: defined
const int _glob = 0;  // Noncompliant: starts with '_' in global namespace

#endif
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
#if defined MY_FILE
#define MY_FILE

#define FIELD_VAL(field) ##field

const bool is_defined = false;
const int glob = 0;

#endif
----
