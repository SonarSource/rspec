== Why is this an issue?

Capturing and logging errors is critical to monitoring the health of your Azure Functions application.

Each `catch` block inside an Azure Function should log helpful details about the failure. Moreover, the logging should not be done at `Debug` or `Trace` level.

Consider using the built-in integration with Application Insights for better monitoring of your Application.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
[FunctionName("Foo")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
	[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
	ILogger log)
{
	try
	{
		// do stuff that can fail
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		// the failure is not logged at all OR is logged at DEBUG/TRACE level
	}
}
