== Why is this an issue?

Shadowing a builtin makes your code more difficult to read and maintain. It may also be a source of bugs as you can reference the builtin by mistake.


It is sometimes ok to shadow a builtin to improve the readability of a public API or to support multiple versions of a library. In these cases the value is higher than the maintainability cost. Just be careful when you do it.


It is not ok to shadow builtins with variables which are local to a function or method. These variables are not public and can be easily renamed, thus reducing the confusion and making the code less error-prone.


This rule raises an issue when the name of a local variable matches the name of a builtin.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
def a_function():
    int = 42  # Noncompliant; int is a builtin
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
def a_function():
    value = 42
----
