Encrypting data is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7902[CVE-2017-7902]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1378[CVE-2006-1378]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2003-1376[CVE-2003-1376]

Proper encryption requires both the encryption algorithm and the key to be strong. Obviously the private key needs to remain secret and be renewed regularly. However these are not the only means to defeat or weaken an encryption.

This rule flags function calls that initiate encryption/decryption.
