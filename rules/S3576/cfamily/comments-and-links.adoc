FYI [~evgeny.mandrikov] RuleAPI will automatically convert S\d+ into the format the platform needs to form a link to a rule.

\[~alban.auzeill] you don't have to insert the rule-link syntax. That's handled for you by RuleAPI

@Ann I'm doing several tests to try to find a temporary solution to the following problem: First, we generate the description of a rule using rule-api with the option "-language c". Then we use this description for C,{cpp},ObjC, and for example "S3471" will always be transformed to \{rule:c:S3471\} even if I need \{rule:cpp:S3471\}


But, yes, at the end "S3471" is perfect once I have implemented the generation of the 3 languages separately...but it's not yet the case.
