== Why is this an issue?

A global function named ``++main++`` is the entry point to the program, and is the only identifier which must be in the global namespace. The use of ``++main++`` for other functions may not meet developer expectations.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int main() {       // Compliant
}

namespace {
  int main() {     // Noncompliant
  }
}
namespace NS {
  int main() {     // Noncompliant
  }
}
----


== Resources

* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 7-3-2 - The identifier main shall not be used for a function other than global function main.

\[~massimo.paladin] IMO we should clearly specify what means "its equivalent" and so as consequence change implementation. WDYT?

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] I modified the the beginning of the message, let me know if it is not better. Maybe it could be extended to forbid also ``++wmain++``, WDYT?
