== Why is this an issue?

`std::enable_if` is a very important part of template meta-programming in {cpp} up to {cpp}17. Based on SFINAE, it can be used to subtly tune the behavior of overload resolution based on properties of types.

However, using `std::enable_if` correctly is not easy, and requires skills and experience, for a resulting code that is not straightforward. Since {cpp}20, new features offer first-class support for what used to require `enable_if` trickery:

* Concepts allow defining named constraints on types, using a terse syntax to specify that a template argument must adhere to a concept;
* `requires` clauses can be directly written for one-shot constraints;
* In some cases, using `if constexpr` (introduced in {cpp}17) may replace an overload set with just one function (see S6017).

Additionally, since those features provide a higher level of abstraction, compilers understand them better and can provide clearer diagnostics when a constraint is violated.

As a consequence, `std::enable_if` is no longer the right tool and should be replaced with those facilities. Note that the replacement is not always mechanical: The expression controlling a `std::enable_if` would probably be acceptable as a `requires` condition, but better alternatives usually exist, for instance reusing an existing concept defined in the standard.

This rule reports the use of `std::enable_if`.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
template <typename N, class = typename
  std::enable_if<std::is_integral_v<N> && std::is_signed_v<N>>::type> // Noncompliant
auto negate(N n) { return -n; }
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template <class N> requires std::signed_integral<N>
auto negate(N n) { return -n; }
----
Or
[source,cpp]
----
template <std::signed_integral N>
auto negate(N n) { return -n; }
----
Or
[source,cpp]
----
auto negate(std::signed_integral auto n) { return -n; }
----
