Shifting an integral number by 0 is equivalent to doing nothing but makes the code confusing for maintainers.


If the first operand is an ``++int++`` or ``++uint++`` (32-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of the second operand. That is, the actual shift count is 0 to 31 bits.

Note that integral number with a less than 32-bit quantity (e.g. ``++short++``, ``++ushort++``...) are implicitly converted to ``++int++`` before the shifting operation and so the rule for ``++int++``/``++uint++`` applies.


If the first operand is a ``++long++`` or ``++ulong++`` (64-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of the second operand. That is, the actual shift count is 0 to 63 bits.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void Main() 
{
    short s = 1;
    short shortShift1 = (short)(s << 0); // Noncompliant    
    short shortShift1 = (short)(s << 16); // Compliant as short will be cast to int (16 is between 0 and 31)
    short shortShift3 = (short)(s << 32); // Noncompliant, this is equivalent to shifting by 1

    int i = 1;
    int intShift1 = i << 0; // Noncompliant    
    int intShift2 = i << 32; // Noncompliant, this is equivalent to shifting by 1

    long lg = 1;
    long longShift1 = lg << 0; // Noncompliant
    long longShift2 = lg << 64; // Noncompliant, this is equivalent to shifting by 1
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public void Main() 
{
    short s = 1;
    short shortShift1 = s;
    short shortShift1 = (short)(s << 16); 
    short shortShift3 = (short)(s << 1);

    int i = 1;
    var intShift1 = i; 
    var intShift2 = i << 1;

    long lg = 1;
    var longShift1 = lg;
    var longShift2 = lg << 1;
}
