== Why is this an issue?

Since an `int` is a 32-bit variable, shifting by more than +/-31 is confusing at best and an error at worst. When the runtime shifts 32-bit integers, it uses the lowest 5 bits of the shift count operand. In other words, shifting an `int` by 32 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 33 is the same as shifting it by 1.


Similarly, when shifting 64-bit integers, the runtime uses the lowest 6 bits of the shift count operand and shifting `long` by 64 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 65 is the same as shifting it by 1.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public int shift(int a) {
  int x = a >> 32; // Noncompliant
  return a << 48;  // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public int shift(int a) {
  int x = a >> 31;
  return a << 16;
}
----
