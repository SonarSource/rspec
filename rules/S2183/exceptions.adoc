=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an issue when the shift by zero is obviously for cosmetic reasons:

* When the value shifted is a literal.
* When there is a similar shift at the same position on line before or after. E.g.:

----
bytes[loc+0] = (byte)(value >> 8);
bytes[loc+1] = (byte)(value >> 0);
----
