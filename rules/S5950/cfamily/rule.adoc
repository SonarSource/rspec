`make_unique` and `make_shared` are more concise than explicitly calling the constructor of `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` since they don't require specifying the type multiple times and eliminate the need to use `new`.

`make_unique` and `make_shared` should also be preferred for exception-safety and performance reasons.

*Exception-Safety*

While `make_unique` and `make_shared` are exception-safe, complex constructions of `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` might not be because {cpp} allows arbitrary order of evaluation of subexpressions (until {cpp}17).

Consider this example:

----
f(unique_ptr<Lhs>(new Lhs()), throwingFunction());
----

The following scenario can happen:

. Memory allocation for `Lhs`
. Construction of the `Lhs` object
. Call to `throwingFunction` (before the `unique_ptr` construction)
. `throwingFunction` throws an exception
. The constructed `Lhs` object is leaked since the `unique_ptr` isn't constructed yet

Note: This scenario can only happen before {cpp}17. From {cpp}17, the standard states that even though the order of evaluation of each argument is still unspecified, interleaving the evaluation of different arguments is no longer allowed. This makes the direct construction of `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` exception-safe.

*Performance*

Using `make_unique()` doesn’t impact performance, but `make_shared()` improves it slightly. +
Indeed, constructing explicitly `shared_ptr()` requires two heap allocations: one for the managed object and the other for the control block that stores data about the ref-counts and the `shared_ptr()` deleter. `make_shared()` on the other hand, performs only one heap allocation.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> uniqueP(new MyClass(42)); // Noncompliant
std::shared_ptr<MyClass> sharedP(new MyClass(42)); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
auto uniqueP = std::make_unique<MyClass>(42);
auto sharedP = std::make_shared<MyClass>(42);
std::unique_ptr<std::FILE, std::function<void(std::FILE*)>> file(
  fopen("example.txt", "r"),
  [](FILE* inFile) { fclose(inFile); }); // Compliant: custom deleter is specified
----


== Exceptions

This rule ignores code that uses features not supported by `make_shared` and `make_unique`:

* custom deleters
* calling placement-new, i.e., version of `new` with arguments, like `new(std::nothrow)`

In addition, `make_shared` does not support the following:

* custom operator `new`
* allocating arrays (before {cpp}20)
