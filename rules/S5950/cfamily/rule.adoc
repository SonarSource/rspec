Prefer ``++make_unique++`` and ``++make_shared++`` over explicitly calling the constructor of ``++unique_ptr++`` and ``++shared_ptr++``, they are more concise since they don't require specifying the type multiple times and they eliminate the need to use new!


*Exception-Safety*


While ``++make_unique++`` and ``++make_shared++`` are exception-safe, complex construction of ``++unique_ptr++`` and ``++shared_ptr++`` might not be.


This is because {cpp} allows arbitrary order of evaluation of subexpressions.


Consider this example:

----
f(unique_ptr<Lhs>(new Lhs()), throwingFunction());
----

This scenario can happen:


. Memory is allocated for ``++Lhs++``
. ``++Lhs++`` object is constructed
. ``++throwingFunction++`` is called before the ``++unique_ptr++`` construction
. ``++throwingFunction++`` throws an exception.
. The constructed ``++Lhs++`` object is leaked since the ``++unique_ptr++`` isn't constructed yet

Note: This scenario can only happen before ``{cpp}17``. the new standard states that each argument needs to be fully evaluated before the evaluation of the other arguments. In this case, the explicit construction of ``++unique_ptr++`` and ``++shared_ptr++`` is exception-safe.


*Performance*


While ``++make_uniqe()++`` doesn't have an impact on performance, ``++make_shared()++`` does.

``++make_shared()++`` performs one heap-allocation. While constructing ``++shared_ptr()++`` explicitly will require two: one for the object being managed and the other for the control block that stores data about the ref-counts and the ``++shared_ptr()++`` deleter.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> uniqueP(new MyClass(42)); // Noncompliant
std::shared_ptr<MyClass> sharedP(new MyClass(42)); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
auto uniqueP = std::make_unique<MyClass>(42);
auto sharedP = std::make_shared<MyClass>(42);
std::unique_ptr<std::FILE, std::function<void(std::FILE*)>> file(
  fopen("example.txt", "r"),
  [](FILE* inFile) { fclose(inFile); }); // compliant: custom deleter is specified
----


== Exceptions

The `make_` creation functions do not support:

* `make_shared` and `make_unique`: using custom deleters,
* `make_shared` and `make_unique`: calling placement-new, i.e. version of ``new`` with arguments, like `new(std::nothrow)`
* `make_shared` only: using operator `new` provided by class
* `make_shared` up to {cpp}20: allocating arrays

This rule will not raise issues for code that uses any of these features.
