== How to fix it

This rule raises an issue when an exception is thrown from within a destructor or from a function transitively called by a destructor.

Such an exception should be caught and handled before the destructor exits.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

In the following example, an exception is thrown inside the `Builder` destructor when calling `std::optional::value` on an empty optional.
It follows that the program abruptly terminates when `b` gets destroyed during stack unwinding in `application()` if the user name lookup fails.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void logBuilderDestruction(int userId);

class Builder {
  std::optional<int> _id;

 public:
  void setId(int userId) { _id = userId; }

  ~Builder() {
    auto userId = _id.value(); // Noncompliant: may throw std::bad_optional_access
    logBuilderDestruction(userId);
  }
};

std::unordered_map<std::string, int>& getDatabase();

int lookupUserId(std::string const& name) {
  return getDatabase().at(name); // May throw std::out_of_range.
}

void application(std::string const& name) {
  Builder b;
  b.setId(lookupUserId(name));
  // lookupUserId throws an exception when the name is unknown.
  // This causes the stack to unwind: local variables alive at
  // this point, such a "b", are destroyed. This happens before
  // the invocation of "b.setId()" so "b._id" is still empty
  // when its destructor is executed.

  // ...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

The solution below uses `std::optional::value_or` to ensure no exceptions are thrown from the destructor.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void logBuilderDestruction(int userId);

class Builder {
  std::optional<int> _id;

 public:
  void setId(int userId) { _id = userId; }

  ~Builder() {
    auto userId = _id.value_or(-1); // Compliant: never throws.
    logBuilderDestruction(userId);
  }
};

std::unordered_map<std::string, int>& getDatabase();

int lookupUserId(std::string const& name) {
  return getDatabase().at(name); // May throw std::out_of_range.
}

void application(std::string const& name) {
  Builder b;
  b.setId(lookupUserId(name));
  // lookupUserId throws an exception when the name is unknown.
  // This causes the stack to unwind: local variables alive at
  // this point, such a "b", are destroyed. This happens before
  // the invocation of "b.setId()" so "b._id" is still empty
  // when its destructor is executed.

  // ...
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

How to deal with exceptions in destructors highly depends on the application.
Below, we present another way to solve the issue with an RAII-based class representing a temporary directory.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// Delete the given directory; throws OSException on failure.
void deleteDirectory(Path path) noexcept(false) {
  // ...
}

class TemporaryDirectory {
  Path tmp;

public:
  TemporaryDirectory(); // Create a new temporary directory.

  TemporaryDirectory(TemporaryDirectory const&) = delete;
  TemporaryDirectory(TemporaryDirectory&&) = delete;
  TemporaryDirectory& operator=(TemporaryDirectory const&) = delete;
  TemporaryDirectory& operator=(TemporaryDirectory&&) = delete;

  ~TemporaryDirectory() {
    deleteDirectory(tmp); // Noncompliant: may throw.
  }
};
----

==== Compliant solution

Depending on the use case for those temporary directories, applying some remedial actions to avoid leaking secrets may be essential.
Yet, it may be reasonable to simply log and silence the exception, for example, in the context of unit tests.

It is possible to redesign the class:

* Add a `remove` member function for scenarios that must carefully and reliably handle any `OSException`.
  In sensitive contexts, the application should not solely rely on the destructor.
* Call this `remove` function from the destructor and catch any exception.
  This preserves the original class intent: an attempt to delete the directory is made.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Delete the given directory; throws OSException on failure.
void deleteDirectory(Path path) noexcept(false) {
  // ...
}

class TemporaryDirectory {
  Path tmp;

public:
  TemporaryDirectory(); // Create a new temporary directory.

  TemporaryDirectory(TemporaryDirectory const&) = delete;
  TemporaryDirectory(TemporaryDirectory&&) = delete;
  TemporaryDirectory& operator=(TemporaryDirectory const&) = delete;
  TemporaryDirectory& operator=(TemporaryDirectory&&) = delete;

  void remove() { deleteDirectory(tmp); }

  ~TemporaryDirectory() {
    try {
      remove();
    } catch (OSException const& e) {
      logFailureToRemoveDirectory(e);
    }
  }
 };
----

=== Pitfalls

Using a _function-try-block_ in a destructor does not prevent the destructor from exiting with an exception.

For example, the following destructor does not prevent the exception from escaping.

[source,cpp]
----
~TemporaryDirectory() try {
  remove();
} catch (OSException const& e) {
  logFailureToRemoveDirectory(e);
}
// `e` is automatically rethrow as if `throw;` was used.
----

Instead, a _try-block_ should be used within the destructor's body.

=== Going the extra mile

It is possible to detect whether a destructor is executed during stack unwinding and act accordingly; for example, to implement a transaction rollback action.

The {cpp}17 https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/uncaught_exception[`std::uncaught_exceptions`] function can be used for this purpose, as explained in https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4152.pdf[N4152].
This function ends with an `s` and should not be confused with `std::uncaught_exception`, which got removed in {cpp}20 for the reasons exposed in the paper.
