Code should not rely on features beyond the configured {cpp} standard

== Why is this an issue?

Relying on features that are not part of the configured {cpp} standard leads to non-portable builds and fragile code. Some toolchains accept such code as extensions or for backward compatibility, while others strictly reject it under the same standard setting. This rule flags:

* Uses of features from future {cpp} standards (compared to the configured standard).
* Uses of features removed in the configured {cpp} standard.
* Uses of C-only constructs that some {cpp} implementations accept as extensions.

Keeping code within the configured standard ensures consistency across compilers and prevents accidental lock-in to permissive extensions. Check the list of related rules for focused rules that report specific compiler extension cases; S8216 covers remaining standard violations not addressed by these specialized rules.

This version primarily reports extensions starting from {cpp}20 and later. For example, it does not yet report use of a {cpp}17-only feature when the configured standard is {cpp}14. This limitation is temporary and will be addressed in a future update.

== How to fix it

Replace uses of out-of-scope features with standard-conforming alternatives that exist in the configured {cpp} standard. If the newer feature (or a removed feature) is truly required, upgrade (or align) the project’s configured standard and all toolchains consistently.

=== Defaulted comparison operators

Defaulted comparison operators are introduced in {cpp}20. When the configured standard is earlier than {cpp}20, using defaulted comparison operators is noncompliant. Under {cpp}20 or later, the same code is compliant.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct Account {
  int id;
  bool operator==(const Account&) const = default; // Noncompliant before C++20
};
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct Account {
  int id;
  bool operator==(const Account& other) const { return id == other.id; }
};
----

=== Using enum declaration

The "using enum" declaration is a {cpp}20 feature. When the configured standard is earlier than {cpp}20, it is noncompliant to rely on it. Under {cpp}20 or later, the same code is compliant.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
enum class Status { Ok, Error };
using enum Status; // Noncompliant before C++20
auto s = Ok;
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
enum class Status { Ok, Error };
auto s = Status::Ok;
----

=== Lambda template parameter list

Lambda template parameter lists are available starting in {cpp}20. When the configured standard is earlier than {cpp}20, this usage is noncompliant. Under {cpp}20 or later, the same code is compliant.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
auto mapValue = []<typename T>(T t) { return t; }; // Noncompliant before C++20
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
auto mapValue = [](auto t) { return t; };
----

=== C array designators in {cpp}

Some C-only constructs, such as array designators, may be accepted by {cpp} compilers as extensions, but they are not part of the {cpp} standard and should be avoided in {cpp} code.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int values[3] = { [1] = 5 }; // Noncompliant in C++
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
int values[3] = {};
values[1] = 5;
----

=== std::bind1st and std::bind2nd

The ``++std::bind1st++`` and ``++std::bind2nd++`` function templates were deprecated in {cpp}11 and removed in {cpp}17. When the configured standard is {cpp}17 or later, using these functions is noncompliant. Under earlier standards, the same code may be compliant but is still deprecated.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <functional>

auto bound = std::bind1st(std::greater<int>(), 5); // Noncompliant in C++17 or later
auto result = bound(3); // Returns true (5 > 3)
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <functional>

auto bound = std::bind(std::greater<int>(), 5, std::placeholders::_1);
auto result = bound(3); // Returns true (5 > 3)
----

Or use a lambda expression:

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
auto bound = [](int x) { return std::greater<int>()(5, x); };
auto result = bound(3); // Returns true (5 > 3)
----
