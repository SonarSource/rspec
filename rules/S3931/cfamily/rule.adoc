=== Exceptions

In {cpp}, it is common to null-check a pointer by using it as a condition. In such cases, if the pointer is ``++NULL++``, the condition evaluates to ``++false++``, and otherwise it is ``++true++``. Such pointer assignments are ignored: 


----
int *ip;
if (ip = get_status() ) {...}
----

CLang is able to detect the same kind of quality issues and allows to switch-off those issues by surrounding the non-boolean assignment with some parentheses. To prevent raising some issues which were intentionally switched off, this rule supports the same coding convention: 


----
if((my_status = get_status())) {...}
----
