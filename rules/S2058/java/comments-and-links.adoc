\[~nicolas.peru] please read over this code example & make sure I correctly understood the problem. Not much data in the FB rule description to work from.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Example updated, the FB rule refers to storage into fields that are Serializable.

I updated the code examples to reflect what I think is the intent of the FB rule (and I removed a crucial inconsistency).

If my understanding of this rule is correct, this rule is triggered when:

* the enclosing class implements Serializable (directly or not)
* the field is declared with a non-Serializable type
* the assignment assigns an instance of a non-Serializable type which is different from the type used in the field declaration.
Therefore, it only raises issues on assignments to fields which are themselves detected by RSPEC-1948.

As I don't see why someone would activate that rule without activating RSPEC-1948, I don't see how useful it is.
