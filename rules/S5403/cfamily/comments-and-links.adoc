\[~geoffray.adde] I agree for the ``++move++`` part, but we already have RSPEC-5018 for that. I kind of agree for the swap part, but I think it would fit perfectly within RSPEC-5018 that we could just extend a little.

For constructor, I'm not so sure:

* "Creation and destruction of local variables allocated on the stack can throw": Yes, and making the default constructor noexcept will not prevent this
* "It makes that any scope should be protected by a try-catch block": I don't see why
It might be desirable that the moved-from state of an object is equivalent to the default constructed one, and for that, having a noexcept default constructor might help, but this looks more like a low priority code smell to me.


What do you think?

After discussion with [~geoffray.adde]: Ok to add swap to RPSEC-5018, and drop the default constructor part. Which means this RSPEC is no longer needed.
