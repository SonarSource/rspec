== Why is this an issue?

The catch-all handler should come last in a chain of ``++catch++`` or ``++@catch++`` statements because it catches everything, and any more-specific ``++catch++``/``++@catch++`` that comes after it will never be used, even when the relevant condition occurs. 


This {cpp} code sample is very similar to the Objective-C equivalent with ``++@try++`` and ``++@catch++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f1()
{
  try
  {
    // ...
  }
  catch (...)
  {
    // Handle all exception types
  }
  catch (std::exception const &e)  // Noncompliant - handler will never be called
  {
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f1()
{
  try
  {
    // ...
  }
  catch (std::exception const &e)  // Compliant
  {
    // Handle standard exceptions
  }
  catch (...)        // Compliant catch-all handler
  {
    // Handle all other exception types
  }
}
