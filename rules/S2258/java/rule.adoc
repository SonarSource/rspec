== Why is this an issue?

By contract, the ``++NullCipher++`` class provides an "identity cipher" - one that does not transform or encrypt the plaintext in any way. As a consequence, the ciphertext is identical to the plaintext. So this class should be used for testing, and never in production code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
NullCipher nc = new NullCipher();
----
