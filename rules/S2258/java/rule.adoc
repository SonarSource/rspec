By contract, the ``++NullCipher++`` class provides an "identity cipher" - one that does not transform or encrypt the plaintext in any way. As a consequence, the ciphertext is identical to the plaintext. So this class should be used for testing, and never in production code.


== Noncompliant Code Example

NullCipher nc = new NullCipher();
