== Why is this an issue?

Throwing as an exception an object that is not derived from ``++std::exception++`` is a bad practice. It is usually unreliable, meaningless, and a source of type clashes.


For the same reason, catching a non-exception type is a sign that your application has a bad exception-handling design. You should use standard exception types or create your own exception types that inherit at some level from ``++std::exception++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
try {
  /* code that can throw: 42 */
} catch (int ex) { // Noncompliant
  if (ex == 42) {
    /*...*/
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
try {
  /* code that can throw: std::domain_error("User ID not found.") */
} catch (const std::domain_error& ex) {
  /*...*/
}
----
