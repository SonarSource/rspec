== Why is this an issue?

The ``++open++`` builtin can open files in different modes, which are provided as a combination of characters. Using an invalid sequence of characters will at best make ``++open++`` fail, or worse, it will have an undefined behavior (ex: it might ignore some characters).


A valid mode:

* should contain one and only one of the following characters: "r" (read), "w" (write), "a" (append), "x" (create).
* should contain zero or one of the following characters: "t" (text), "b" (binary).
* should contain zero or one "+" character (open for updating)
* cannot contain "a", "w", "+", or "x" if "U" (universal newlines) is used. Note that "U" has no effect in python 3, it is deprecated and shouldn't be used anymore.

This rule raises an issue when an invalid "mode" is provided to the ``++open++`` builtin.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
# In python 3 the following fails
# In python 2.7.16 on MacOs, "open" will just ignore the "w" flag
with open("test.txt", "aw") as f:  # Noncompliant
    pass
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
with open("test.txt", "a") as f:
    pass
