If the resource makes outbound requests, such as

* `Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/linkedservices`
* `Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/pipelines`

and is not using certificate-based authentication:

> Web requests will not use certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.

{nbsp}

If the resource needs to be configured with a list of trusted certificates, such as

* `Microsoft.DocumentDB/cassandraClusters`
* `Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways`
* `Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters`

and the list of certificates is either empty or missing:

> Omitting a list of trusted certificates disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.

{nbsp}

If the resource is missing a required configuration entry:

> Omitting `{property_name}` disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.

{nbsp}

If the resource specifies a configuration value that makes the use of client certificates optional, such as

* `Microsoft.App/containerApps` when `clientCertificateMode` = `accept`
* `Microsoft.Web/sites` when `clientCertMode` = `Optional`

> Make sure that setting certificate-based authentication as optional is safe here.

{nbsp}

If the resource is has a configuration entry that disables certificate-based authentication, such as

* `Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/gateways/hostnameConfigurations` when `negotiateClientCertificate` != `true`
* `Microsoft.App/containerApps` when `clientCertificateMode` = `ignore`
* `Microsoft.SignalRService/signalR` when `clientCertEnabled` != `true`
* `Microsoft.SignalRService/webPubSub` when `clientCertEnabled` != `true`
* `Microsoft.Web/sites` when `clientCertEnabled` != `true`

> Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.
