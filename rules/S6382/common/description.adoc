Disabling certificate-based authentication can reduce an organization's
ability to react against attacks on its critical functions and data.

Azure offers various authentication options to access resources: Anonymous
connections, Basic authentication, password-based authentication, and
certificate-based authentication.

Choosing certificate-based authentication helps bring client/host trust by
allowing the host to verify the client and vice versa. It cannot be forged or
forwarded by a man-in-the-middle eavesdropper, and the certificate's private
key is never sent over the network so it's harder to steal than a password.

In case of a security incident, certificates help bring investigators
traceability and allow security operations teams to react faster. For example,
all compromised certificates could be revoked individually, or an issuing
certificate could be revoked which causes all the certificates it issued to
become untrusted.
