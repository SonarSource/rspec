=== Highlighting

* If one (out of one) assignment is missing: Highlight the resource
* If an assignment is security-sensitive: Highlight the assignment
* For `linux_web_app` and `windows_web_app`:
** If both assignments are present and security-sensitive: Highlight `client_certificate_enabled = false`
