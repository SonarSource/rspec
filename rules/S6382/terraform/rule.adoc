Disabling certificate-based authentication can reduce an organization's ability to react against attacks on its critical functions and data, if any.

Disabling certificate-based authentication can reduce an organization's ability to react against attacks on its critical functions and data if any.

Multiple authentication choices may be possible on the Azure resource: Anonymous connections, Basic authentication, password-based authentication, and certificate-based authentication.

Choosing certificate-based authentication helps bring client/host trust by allowing the host to verify the client and vice versa.
In case of a security incident, certificates help bring investigators traceability and allow security operations teams to react faster (by massively revoking certificates, for example).

== Ask Yourself Whether

* This Azure resource is essential for the information system infrastructure.
* This Azure resource is essential for mission-critical functions.
* Compliance policies require access to this resource to specifically be authenticated with certificates.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Enable certificate-based authentication.

== Sensitive Code Example

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/[App Service]:

----
resource "azurerm_app_service" "example" {
  client_cert_enabled = false # Sensitive
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/[Logic App Standards] and https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/[Function Apps]:

----
resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  client_cert_mode = "Optional" # Sensitive
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/Data[Data Factory Linked Services]:

----
resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_web" "example" {
  authentication_type = "Basic" # Sensitive
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/[API Management]:

----
resource "azurerm_api_management" "example" {
  sku_name = "Consumption_1"
  client_certificate_mode = "Optional" # Sensitive
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/app-service/containers/[Linux and Windows Web Apps]:

----
resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "sensitive_web_app" {
  client_cert_enabled = false # Sensitive
}
resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "sensitive_web_app" {
  client_cert_enabled = true
  client_cert_mode = "Optional" # Sensitive
}
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/[App Service]:

----

  client_cert_enabled = true
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/[Logic App Standards] and https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/[Function Apps]:

----

  client_cert_mode = "Required"
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/Data[Data Factory Linked Services]:

----
resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_web" "example" {
  authentication_type = "ClientCertificate"
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/[API Management]:

----
resource "azurerm_api_management" "example" {
  sku_name = "Consumption_1"
  client_certificate_mode = "Required"
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/app-service/containers/[Linux and Windows Web Apps]:

=== Message

* For `api_management`:
** If `client_certificate_enabled` is missing: Omitting `client_certificate_mode` disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
** If `client_certificate_enabled = false`: Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here. 
* For `app_service`:
** If `client_cert_enabled` is missing: Omitting `client_cert_enabled` disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
** If `client_cert_enabled = false`: Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.
* For `data_factory_linked_service_sftp` and `data_factory_linked_service_web`
** If `authentication_type = "Basic"`: Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.
* For `function_app` and `logic_app_standard`: 
** If `client_cert_mode` is missing: Omitting `client_cert_mode` disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
** If `client_cert_mode = "Optional"`: Make sure that setting certificate-based authentication as optional is safe here.   
* For `linux_web_app` and `windows_web_app`:
** If `client_cert_enabled` is missing: Omitting `client_cert_enabled` disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
** If `client_cert_enabled = false`: Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.
** If `client_cert_mode` is missing: Omitting `client_cert_mode` disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
** If `client_cert_mode = "Optional"`: Make sure that setting certificate-based authentication as optional is safe here.   
** If both parameters are missing or non-compliant: Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here. 

Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.

=== Highlighting

* If one (out of one) assignement is missing: Highlight the resource
* If an assignement is security-sensitive: Highlight the assignement
* For `linux_web_app` and `windows_web_app`:
** If both assignements are present and security-sensitive: Highlight `client_cert_enabled = false`
