* `app_service`
* `data_factory_linked_service_sftp`
* `data_factory_linked_service_web`
* `linux_web_app` 
* `windows_web_app` (if both parameters are non-compliant, flag `client_cert_enabled` first)

These messages apply:

* If an assignment is missing: Omitting {property_name} disables certificate-based authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
* If the assignment is security-sensitive: Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.

* For `function_app` and `logic_app_standard`:
** Omitting `client_cert_mode` makes certificate-based authentication optional. Make sure it is safe here.
** Make sure that setting certificate-based authentication as optional is safe here.

Make sure that disabling certificate-based authentication is safe here.
