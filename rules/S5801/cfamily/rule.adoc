In C, a string is just a buffer of characters, normally using the ``++null++`` character as a sentinel for the end of the string. This means that the developer has to be aware of low-level details such as buffer sizes or having an extra character to store the final ``++null++`` character. Doing that correctly and consistently is notoriously difficult and any error can lead to a security vulnerability, for instance, giving access to sensitive data or allowing arbitrary code execution.


The function ``++char *strcpy(char * restrict dest, const char * restrict src);++`` copies characters from ``++src++`` to ``++dest++``. The ``++wcscpy++`` does the same for wide characters and should be used with the same guidelines.


Note: the functions ``++strncpy++`` and ``++wcsncpy++`` might look like attractive safe replacements for ``++strcpy++`` and ``++wcscpy++``, but they have their own set of issues (see S5816), and you should probably prefer another more adapted alternative.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* There is a possibility that either the source or the destination pointer is ``++null++``
* There is a possibility that the source string is not correctly ``++null++``-terminated, or that its length (including the final ``++null++`` character) can be larger than the size of the destination buffer.
* There is an overlap between source and destination

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* C11 provides, in its annex K, the ``++strcpy_s++`` and the ``++wcscpy_s++`` that were designed as safer alternatives to ``++strcpy++`` and ``++wcscpy++``. It's not recommended to use them in all circumstances, because they introduce a runtime overhead and require to write more code for error handling, but they perform checks that will limit the consequences of calling the function with bad arguments.
* Even if your compiler does not exactly support annex K, you probably have access to similar functions, for example, ``++strlcpy++`` in FreeBSD
* If you are writing {cpp} code, using ``++std::string++`` to manipulate strings is much simpler and less error-prone


== Sensitive Code Example

----
int f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strcpy(dest, src); // Sensitive: might overflow
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
int f(char *src) {
  char *dest = malloc(strlen(src) + 1); // For the final 0
  strcpy(dest, src); // Compliant: we made sure the buffer is large enough
  int r= doSomethingWith(dest);
  free(dest);
  return r;
}
----
