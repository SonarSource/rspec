This rule raises an issue when a catch block contains no statements at all, silently ignoring any exceptions that occur.

== Why is this an issue?

Empty catch blocks are problematic because they completely suppress exceptions without any acknowledgment or handling. When an exception occurs, it disappears silently, making it impossible to detect, debug, or recover from errors.

In Salesforce environments, this can be particularly dangerous because:

* Data operations may fail silently, leading to incomplete or corrupted records
* Integration errors go unnoticed, causing synchronization issues
* Performance problems remain hidden, affecting user experience
* Compliance and audit trails become incomplete

Even if you expect certain exceptions to occur and want to ignore them, an empty catch block provides no documentation of this intent. Future developers (including yourself) won't understand why the exception is being ignored or whether it's safe to do so.

Proper exception handling doesn't always mean stopping execution - it means making a conscious decision about how to respond to the error condition.

=== What is the potential impact?

Silent failures can lead to data corruption, incomplete business processes, and difficult-to-diagnose production issues. In Salesforce contexts, this can result in missing records, failed integrations, or compliance violations that go undetected.

== How to fix it

Add appropriate logging to track the exception, even if you choose not to rethrow it. This provides visibility into what's happening in your code.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
try {
    Database.insert(records);
} catch (DmlException e) {
    // Noncompliant: empty catch block
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
try {
    Database.insert(records);
} catch (DmlException e) {
    System.debug('Failed to insert records: ' + e.getMessage());
    // Log the error for monitoring
}
----
