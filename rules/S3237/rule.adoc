In property and indexer ``++set++`` methods, and in event ``++add++`` and ``++remove++`` methods, the implicit ``++value++`` parameter holds the value the accessor was called with. Not using the ``++value++`` means that the accessor ignores the caller's intent which could cause unexpected results at runtime.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
private int count;
public int Count
{
  get { return count; }
  set { count = 42; } // Noncompliant 
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
private int count;
public int Count
{
  get { return count; }
  set { count = value; }
}
----

or


----
public int Count
{
  get { return count; }
  set { throw new InvalidOperationException(); }
}
----


== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an issue when the setter is empty and part of the implementation of an ``++interface++`` . The assumption is that this part of the interface is not meaningful to that particular implementation. A good example of that would be a "sink" logger that discards any logs.
