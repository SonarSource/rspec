== Why is this an issue?

When you need to get external input for `set` and `init` methods defined for properties and indexers or for `remove` and `add` methods for events, you should
always get this input throught the `value` contextual keyword.

The contextual keyword `value` is similar to an input parameter of a method; it references the value that client code is attempting to assign to the property, indexer or event.


The keyword `value` holds the value the accessor was called with. Not using it means that the accessor ignores the caller's intent which could cause unexpected results at runtime.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
private int count;
public int Count
{
  get { return count; }
  set { count = 42; } // Noncompliant 
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
private int count;
public int Count
{
  get { return count; }
  set { count = value; }
}
----

or


[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public int Count
{
  get { return count; }
  set { throw new InvalidOperationException(); }
}
----


=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an issue when the setter is empty and part of the implementation of an `interface`. The assumption is that this part of the interface is not meaningful to that particular implementation. A good example of that would be a "sink" logger that discards any logs.

\[~tamas.vajk] 10min seems like a high remediation cost. Does that mean that the Compliant Solution I added is off-base?

\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] note that I've edited the first line. Your version, "a property and indexer ``++set++`` method" speaks of one, collective method for both a property and an indexer at one time.
