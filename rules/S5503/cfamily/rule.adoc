== Why is this an issue?

``++dynamic_cast++`` allow to convert pointers from one class to another, following the class inheritance hierarchy (note that in many cases, the need to perform a ``++dynamic_cast++`` is an indicator of poor class design, for instance not following the Liskov substitution principle).


If the requested conversion is not possible, the result of the conversion is a null pointer to the requested class.

An implication of this is that result of ``++dynamic_cast++`` should be tested before using it to avoid dereferencing a null pointer.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct Base {
    virtual ~Base() = default;
};

struct Derived: Base {
    virtual void method() {}
};

void f(Base *b) {
    auto d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b);
    d->method(); // Noncompliant, d could be null
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct Base {
    virtual ~Base() = default;
};

struct Derived: Base {
    virtual void method() {}
};

void f(Base *b) {
    if (auto d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b)) {
        d->method();
    }
}
----
