== Why is this an issue?

It is often considered a better style to access objects in generic code with free functions than with member functions, because it allows to adapt an object to a template without modifying it, just by adding the right overload of the free function. This is especially true with containers, which can come in a wide variety (and some of them can't even have member function, for instance, C-style arrays).


Therefore, the {cpp} standard library provides free functions that can be applied on any standard container, and that can be adapted for user-defined containers. They are:

* Since {cpp}11: ``++std::begin++``, ``++std::end++``, ``++std::cbegin++``, ``++std::cend++``
* Since {cpp}14: ``++std::rbegin++``, ``++std::rend++``, ``++std::crbegin++``, ``++std::crend++``
* Since {cpp}17: ``++std::size++``, ``++std::empty++``, ``++std::data++``
* Since {cpp}20: ``++std::ssize++``

When writing generic code, you should prefer using those functions for objects that depend on the template arguments: it will allow your code to work with a broader variety of containers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
bool f(T const &t, std::vector<int> const &v) {
  if (!t.empty()) { // Noncompliant in C++17
    auto val = (t.begin() // Noncompliant in C++11
      ->size()); // Noncompliant in C++17
    return val == v.size(); // Compliant, v does not depend on a template parameter
  }
  return false;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
bool f(T const &t, std::vector<int> const &v) {
  if (!std::empty(t)) { // Compliant
    auto val = std::size(*std::begin(t)); // Compliant
    return val == v.size();
  }
  return false;
}
