== Why is this an issue?

As of Java 5, "assert" is a keyword. By default, using the word as an identifier generates a compilation error, and backward compatibility must be activated with "-source=1.4" to compile such pieces of code. Eventually this backward compatibility mode will be dropped.


The following code snippet illustrates this rule:

----
public void doSomething(){
  int assert = 4;     // Non-Compliant
  ...
}
----
