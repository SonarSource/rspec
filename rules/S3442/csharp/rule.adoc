Since ``++abstract++`` classes can't be instantiated, there's no point in their having ``++public++`` or ``++internal++`` constructors. If there is basic initialization logic that should run when an extending class instance is created, you can by all means put it in a constructor, but make that constructor ``++private++`` or ``++protected++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
abstract class Base
{
    public Base() // Noncompliant, should be private or protected
    {
      //...
    }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
abstract class Base
{
    protected Base()
    {
      //...
    }
}
