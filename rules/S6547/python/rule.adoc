== Why is this an issue?

include::../rationale.adoc[]

In Python, environment variables can be manipulated through `os.environ.update` or passed to subprocesses via the `env` parameter in `subprocess` functions. Attackers could exploit this to inject malicious values into sensitive environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD`, `PATH`, or `PYTHONPATH`, potentially altering application behavior or executing arbitrary code.
