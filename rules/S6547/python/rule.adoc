== Why is this an issue?

include::../rationale.adoc[]

In Python, environment variables can be manipulated through `os.environ` or passed to subprocesses via the `env` parameter in `subprocess` functions. Attackers could exploit this to inject malicious values into sensitive environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD`, `PATH`, or `PYTHONPATH`, potentially altering application behavior or executing arbitrary code.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

Change this code to prevent users from defining arbitrary environment variables.


=== Highlighting

Highlight the `env` parameter in `subprocess.run`, `subprocess.Popen`, `subprocess.call`, `subprocess.check_call`, and `subprocess.check_output` calls when values are derived from untrusted input.

Also highlight direct assignment to `os.environ` with untrusted keys or sensitive keys with untrusted values.
