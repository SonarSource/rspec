== Why is this an issue?

Environment variable tampering occurs in a web application when it retrieves
data like parameters or headers from an incoming HTTP request and uses it to define
the variables.

Depending on the controlled variable, an attacker could
man-in-the-middle network requests or, in rare cases, achieve code execution.


=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker defines sensitive environment variables and can reach
non-intended features or influence application execution flow. These environment
variables could be system defined or application-specific. 

Examples of CVEs that resulted from this vulnerability were CVE-2017-17562 and
CVE-2022-43781.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== LD_PRELOAD: Hijacking library functions

An attacker can upload a shared object to the web server and defines the
LD_PRELOAD environment variable to ensure the shared object is loaded when an arbitrary
executable is run. In this malicious shared object, the attacker would overwrite a used
function in the arbitrary executable and achieve code execution.

==== HTTP_PROXY: Man-in-the-middle newtork requests

The web application runs an executable that respects the HTTP_PROXY
environment variable. An attacker manipulates it to point to a reverse proxy controlled by
him and thus can sniff any sensitive data shared in web requests.
