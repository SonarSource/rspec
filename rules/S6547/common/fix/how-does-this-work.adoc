=== How does this work?

User input should be properly sanitized and validated, and ideally used only for
the value of the environment variable. The environment variable name should be
statically defined.

Validation and sanitization could be done by restricting alphanumeric characters for the
value and evaluating the name, if not statically defined, against an allowlist of
name values.
