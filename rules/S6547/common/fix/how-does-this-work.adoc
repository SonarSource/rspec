=== How does this work?

User input should be properly sanitized, validated and ideally used for
environmental variable value definition only, the name should be statically defined. +
Validation and sanitization could be done by restricting alphanumeric characters for the
value and evaluating the name, if not statically defined, against an allowlist of
name values.
