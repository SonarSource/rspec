=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker defines sensitive environment variables and can reach
non-intended features or influence application execution flow. These environment
variables could be system defined or application-specific. 

Examples of CVEs that resulted from this vulnerability were CVE-2017-17562 and
CVE-2022-43781.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== LD_PRELOAD: Hijacking library functions

An attacker can upload a shared object to the web server and defines the
LD_PRELOAD environment variable to ensure the shared object is loaded when an arbitrary
executable is run. In this malicious shared object, the attacker would overwrite a used
function in the arbitrary executable and achieve code execution.

==== HTTP_PROXY: Man-in-the-middle newtork requests

The web application runs an executable that respects the HTTP_PROXY
environment variable. An attacker manipulates it to point to a reverse proxy controlled by
him and thus can sniff any sensitive data shared in web requests.
