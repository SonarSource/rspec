Creating temporary files in a non-atomic way introduces race conditions issues
in the application's behavior. Indeed, a third party can create a given file
between when the application chooses its name and when it creates it.

In such a situation, the application might use a temporary file that it does not
entirely control. In particular, this file's permissions might be different than
expected. This can lead to trust boundary issues.
