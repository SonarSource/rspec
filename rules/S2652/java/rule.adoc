== Why is this an issue?

To ensure EJB portability, the EJB specification forbids the use of functionality in the ``++java.io++`` package. Instead of reading and writing files, EJB's should use some other means of data storage and retrieval, such as JDBC.


This rule raises an issue for the first ``++java.io++`` method call in each method.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class MyBean implements BeanInterface {

  private File baseline = null;

  private void readBaseline () {
    try {
      baseline = new File(Constants.INTEREST_RATE_FILE);  // Noncompliant.
      if (baseline.exists()) {
        //...
      }
    } catch (IOException e) {  
      //...
    }
  }

  private void writeBaseline() {
    try {
      FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(baseline.getAbsoluteFile());  // Noncompliant
      BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
      bw.write(content); 

      bw.close(); 
    } catch (IOException e) {  
      //...
    }
  }    
}

\[~nicolas.peru] see what you think about the way the rule would raise issues. My first thought was to log an issue for each ``++java.io++`` method call, but that would have quickly gotten ridiculous.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I am wondering about this: what about debt count then ? Maybe we should raise issue on file with a linear debt ?

\[~nicolas.peru] how about we stick with an issue per method-using-I/O with a baseline+offset cost: 10 min + 2 min per I/O-object method call after object acquisition ?

\[~ann.campbell.2] Ok, let's go with that. Probably not the simplest implementation but we'll deal with that during impl time.
