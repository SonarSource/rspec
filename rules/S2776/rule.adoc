Passing user input into a command is always a potentially risky proposition, but it is particularly risky when you're allowing the user to name where control should be transferred.


This rule raises an issue any time user input or web input is used in the transfer of control.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----

*> ...

EXEC CICS
  WEB READ
  FORMFIELD(NAME)

EXEC CICS
  LINK PROGRAM(pNAME)  *> Noncompliant
  *> ...
END-EXEC
