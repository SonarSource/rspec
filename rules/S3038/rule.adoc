== Why is this an issue?

There's no point in redundantly defining an ``++abstract++`` method with the same signature as a method in an ``++interface++`` that the class ``++implements++``. Any concrete child classes will have to implement the method either way.


=== Noncompliant code example

----
public interface Reportable {
  String getReport();
}

public abstract class AbstractRuleReport implements Reportable{
  public abstract String getReport();  // Noncompliant

  // ...
}
