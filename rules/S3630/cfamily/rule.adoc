== Why is this an issue?

Because ``++reinterpret_cast++`` does not perform any type safety validations, it is capable of performing dangerous conversions between unrelated types, often leading to undefined behavior.

In some cases, `reinterpret_cast` can be simply replaced by a more focused cast, such as `static_cast`.

If the goal is to access the binary representation of an object, `reinterpret_cast` leads to undefined behavior. Before {cpp}20, the correct way is to use `memcpy` to copy the object's bits. Since {cpp}20, a better option is available: ``++std::bit_cast++`` allows to reinterpret a value as being of a different type of the same length preserving its binary representation (see also S6181).


This rule raises an issue when ``++reinterpret_cast++`` is used.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
  class A { public: virtual ~A(){} };
  class B : public A { public: void doSomething(){} };

  void func(A *a, float f) {
    B* b = reinterpret_cast<B*>(a) // Noncompliant, another cast is more appropriate
    b->doSomething();
    
    static_assert(sizeof(float) == sizeof(uint32_t));
    uint32_t x = reinterpret_cast<uint32_t&>(f); // Noncompliant and undefined behavior
  }
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
  class A { public: virtual ~A(){} };
  class B : public A { public: void doSomething(){} };

  void func(A *a, float f) {
    if (B* b = dynamic_cast<B*>(a)) {
      b->doSomething();
    }

    static_assert(sizeof(float) == sizeof(uint32_t));
    uint32_t x = std::bit_cast<uint32_t>(f);
    // Or, before C++20
    uint32_t y;
    std::memcpy(&y, &f, sizeof(float));
  }
