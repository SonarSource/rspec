=== Exceptions

For {cpp}11 mode only, the issue is not raised for ternary operators used inside `constexpr` functions. 
In {cpp}11 such functions are limited to just a return statement, so the use of a ternary operator
is required in them. This restriction is lifted in later standards, and thus issues are raised.
