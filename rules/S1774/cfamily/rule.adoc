== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

For {cpp}11 mode only, the issue is not raised for ternary operators used inside `constexpr` functions.
In {cpp}11 such functions are limited to just a return statement, so the use of a ternary operator
is required in them. This restriction is lifted in later standards, and thus issues are raised.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
printf("%s", (i > 10 ? "yes" : "no"));
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (i > 10) {
  printf("yes");
} else {
  printf("no");
}
----
