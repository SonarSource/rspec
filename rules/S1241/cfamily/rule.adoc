== Why is this an issue?

Cf attached code snippet


There is a risk that the reference points at no more

existing data :

â€¢ When returning a dereferenced pointer initialized by new within the function, there is a high risk of memory leak. The caller of the function must remember he has to delete the pointer after the call. Such way of programming can generate potential memory leaks.
