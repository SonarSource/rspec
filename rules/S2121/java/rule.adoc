Creating a substring from 0 to the end is silly. You'll end up with the same string you started with. Using the value of ``++String.length++`` as either the start or end of a substring has similarly predictable results.


Calling ``++String.contains++`` with the argument being identical to the String on which contains is invoked doesn't make sense.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
String speech = "Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country.";

String s1 = speech.substring(0); // Noncompliant. Yields the whole string
String s2 = speech.substring(speech.length()); // Noncompliant. Yields "";
String s3 = speech.substring(5,speech.length()); // Noncompliant. Use the 1-arg version instead

if (speech.contains(speech)) { // Noncompliant
 // always true
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
String speech = "Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country.";

String s1 = speech;
String s2 = "";
String s3 = speech.substring(5);
