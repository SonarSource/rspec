== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all generic type parameter names match a provided regular expression.


The default configuration is the one recommended by Microsoft:

* Must start with an upper case 'T' character, e.g. T
* Followed by Pascal casing, starting with an upper case character, e.g. TKey
* Short abbreviations of 2 letters can be capitalized, e.g. TFooID
* Longer abbreviations need to be lower cased, e.g. TFooHtml


=== Noncompliant code example

With the default parameter value ``++^T(([A-Z]{1,3}[a-z0-9]+)*([A-Z]{2})?)?$++``:

[source,text]
----
Public Class Foo(Of t) ' Noncompliant
End Class
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
Public Class Foo(Of T) ' Compliant
End Class
----
