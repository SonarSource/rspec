When you are using lambdas in a member function, you can capture ``++this++`` implicitly through ``++[=]++`` or ``++[&]++`` or explicitly through ``++[this]++``. This will capture the current object pointer by reference or by value, but the underlying object will always be captured by reference (see S5019).


This will become a problem:

* When the lifetime of the lambda exceeds the one of the current object.
* When you want to capture the current state of the object.
* When you want to pass a copy of the object to avoid any concurrency issue.

``{cpp}14`` provides a workaround to solve this problem. Where you can take the underlying object by copy using the following pattern:

----
auto lam = [copyOfThis = *this] { std::cout << copyOfThis.field; };
----
This is verbose and error-prone, as you might implicitly not use the copied object:

----
auto lam = [& , copyOfThis = *this] { 
std::cout << field; // implicitly calling “this” captured by reference
};
----
``{cpp}17`` solves this problem by introducing an explicit consistent way to capture ``++this++`` by copy:

----
auto lam = [&, *this] { 
std::cout << field // implicitly calling “this” captured by copy
};
----
This rule will flag the ``{cpp}14`` way of capturing the current object by copy and suggest to replace it with the ``{cpp}17`` way.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  int field = 0;
  void memfn() const {
    auto lam = [copyOfThis = *this] { // Noncompliant
      std::cout << copyOfThis.field;
    };
  }
};
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  int field = 0;
  void memfn() const {
    auto lam = [*this] { // Compliant
      std::cout << field;
    };
  }
};
