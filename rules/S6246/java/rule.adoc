== Why is this an issue?

Invoking other Lambdas synchronously from a Lambda is a scalability anti-pattern. Lambdas have a maximum execution time before they timeout (15 minutes as of May 2021). Having to wait for another Lambda to finish its execution could lead to a timeout.


A better solution is to generate events that can be consumed asynchronously by other Lambdas.


=== Noncompliant code example

With AWS SDKv1

[source,java]
----
InvokeRequest invokeRequest = new InvokeRequest()
         .withFunctionName("myFunction");

AWSLambda awsLambda = AWSLambdaClientBuilder.standard()
		.withCredentials(new ProfileCredentialsProvider())
		.withRegion(Regions.US_WEST_2).build();

awsLambda.invoke(invokeRequest); // Noncompliant
