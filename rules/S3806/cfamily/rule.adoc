== Why is this an issue?

The way an ``++#include++`` directive finds an actual file is implementation-defined, and in practice, it slightly differs in different systems.

Therefore, a good practice is to identify the files to include in the most straightforward way possible to reduce the risk of inconsistent behaviors.

This rule raises an issue when:

* The case of the file in the ``++#include++`` directive does not match the case of the file on the disk (the inclusion would not work on a case-sensitive OS),
* The file name in the ``++#include++`` directive contains trailing spaces (they would be ignored on Windows but considered on Unix).


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include "Foo.h" // Noncompliant if the actual file name is "foo.h"
#include "bar.h " // Noncompliant, trailing space
----
