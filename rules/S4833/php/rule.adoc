== Why is this an issue?

PHP 5.3 introduces http://www.php.net/namespaces[namespaces] to the language. Use of this mechanism should be preferred to ``++include++`` or ``++include_once++`` or ``++require++`` or ``++require_once++`` because it solves two common problems:

* it avoids name collisions
* it provides the ability to create alias which improve readability of the code

Starting from its version 8, Drupal is relying on namespaces to be compliant with https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md[PSR-4 standard]. Drupal's modules should be compliant with PSR-4 standard and therefore should no longer rely on ``++include++`` or ``++include_once++`` or ``++require++`` or ``++require_once++`` functions.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
require_once('./modules/vegetable/src/Entity/Tomato.php');
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
use Drupal\vegetable\Entity\Tomato
----


=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise issues on ``++autoload.php++`` or ``++ScriptHandler.php++`` files.
