== Why is this an issue?

Using https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/multidimensional-arrays[multidimensional] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/jagged-arrays[jagged] arrays as method parameters in C# can be challenging for developers.

When these methods are exposed to external users, it requires advanced language knowledge for effective usage. 

Determining the appropriate data to pass to these parameters may not be intuitive.

In this example, it cannot be inferred easily what the matrix should look like. Is it a 2x2 Matrix or even a triangular Matrix?

Using a collection, data structure, or class that provides a more suitable representation of the required data is recommended instead of a multidimensional array or jagged array to enhance code readability.

As a result, avoiding exposing such methods to external users is recommended. 

=== Exceptions

However, using multidimensional and jagged array method parameters internally, such as in `private` or `internal` methods or within `internal` classes, is compliant since they are not publicly exposed.
