Using multidimensional and jagged arrays as function parameters in C# can be challenging for developers. When these methods are exposed to external users, it requires advanced knowledge of the language for effective usage. Additionally, determining the appropriate data to pass to these parameters may not be intuitive. As a result, it is recommended to avoid exposing such methods to external users. 

However, using multidimensional and jagged arrays function parameters internaly, such as in private or internal functions is compliant since they are not publicly exposed.
