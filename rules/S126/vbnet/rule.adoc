== Why is this an issue?

This rule applies whenever an ``++If++`` statement is followed by one or more ``++ElseIf++`` statements; the final ``++ElseIf++`` should be followed by an ``++Else++`` statement.


The requirement for a final ``++Else++`` statement is defensive programming.

The ``++Else++`` statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final ``++Case Else++`` clause in a ``++Select Case++`` statement.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
If x = 0 Then
    DoSomething()
ElseIf x = 1 Then
    DoSomethingElse()
End If

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
If x = 0 Then
    DoSomething()
ElseIf x = 1 Then
    DoSomethingElse()
Else
    Throw New ArgumentException("...")
End If
----
