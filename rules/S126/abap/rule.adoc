This rule applies whenever an ``++IF++`` statement is followed by one or 

more ``++ELSEIF++`` statements; the final ``++ELSEIF++`` should be followed by an ``++ELSE++`` statement.


The requirement for a final ``++ELSE++`` statement is defensive programming. 

The ``++ELSE++`` statement should either take appropriate action or contain 

a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the 

requirement to have a final ``++OTHERS++`` clause in a ``++CASE++``

statement. 

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
IF RESULT > 0.
  PERFORM do_something.
ELSEIF RESULT = 0.
  PERFORM do_something_else.
ENDIF.
----

== Compliant Solution

----
IF RESULT > 0.
  PERFORM do_something.
ELSEIF RESULT = 0.
  PERFORM do_something_else.
ELSE.
  PERFORM error.
ENDIF.
