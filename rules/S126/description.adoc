This rule applies whenever an ``++if++`` statement is followed by one or more ``++else if++`` statements; the final ``++else if++`` should be followed by an ``++else++`` statement.


The requirement for a final ``++else++`` statement is defensive programming.

The ``++else++`` statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final ``++default++`` clause in a ``++switch++`` statement.
