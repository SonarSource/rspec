== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
if (x == 0) {
  doSomething();
} else if (x == 1) {
  doSomethingElse();
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
if (x == 0) {
  doSomething();
} else if (x == 1) {
  doSomethingElse();
} else {
  error();
}
----

=== Exceptions

When all branches of an ``++if++``-``++else if++`` end with ``++return++``, ``++break++`` or ``++throw++``, the code that comes after the ``++if++`` implicitly behaves as if it was in an ``++else++`` clause. This rule will therefore ignore that case.
