This rule applies whenever an ``++IF++`` statement is followed by one or more ``++ELSE IF++`` statements; the final ``++ELSE IF++`` should be followed by an ``++ELSE++`` statement.


The requirement for a final ``++ELSE++`` statement is defensive programming.

The ``++ELSE++`` statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final ``++ELSE++`` clause in a ``++CASE++`` statement.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
IF @x = 1
  PRINT 'A'
ELSE IF @x = 2
  PRINT 'B'
ELSE IF @x = 3
  PRINT 'C'
-- Noncompliant; final ELSE is missing
----

== Compliant Solution

----
IF @x = 1
  PRINT 'A'
ELSE IF @x = 2
  PRINT 'B'
ELSE IF @x = 3
  PRINT 'C'
ELSE
  PRINT 'Z'
