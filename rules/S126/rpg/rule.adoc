== Why is this an issue?

This rule applies whenever an ``++IF++`` statement is followed by one or more ``++ELSEIF++`` statements; the final ``++ELSEIF++`` should be followed by an ``++ELSE++`` statement.

The requirement for a final ``++ELSE++`` statement is defensive programming. 

The ``++ELSE++`` statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final ``++OTHER++`` clause in a ``++SELECT++`` statement.
