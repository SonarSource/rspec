This rule applies whenever an ``++if++`` statement is followed by one or more ``++elsif++`` statements; the final ``++elsif++`` should be followed by an ``++else++`` statement.


The requirement for a final ``++else++`` statement is defensive programming.

The ``++else++`` statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final ``++else++`` clause in a ``++case++`` statement.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if x == 0                                      
  doSomething
elsif x == 1
  doSomethingElse
end
----

== Compliant Solution

----
if x == 0                                      
  doSomething
elsif x == 1
  doSomethingElse
else
  raise 'An error has occured'
end
----

== Exceptions

When all branches of an ``++if++``-``++else if++`` end with ``++return++``, ``++break++`` or ``++throw++``, the code that comes after the ``++if++`` implicitly behaves as if it was in an ``++else++`` clause. This rule will therefore ignore that case.
