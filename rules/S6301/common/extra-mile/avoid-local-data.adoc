==== Avoid storing sensitive data on user devices

In general, it is always preferable to store as little sensitive data on user devices as possible.

Of course, some sensitive data always has to be stored on client devices, such as the data required for authentication. In this case, consider whether the application logic can also function with a hash (or otherwise non-reversible form) of that data. For example, if an email address is required for authentication, it might be possible to use and store a hashed version of this address instead.
