==== Using Android's builtin key storage options

The https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore[Android Keystore] system allows apps to store encryption keys in a container that is protected on a system level. Additionally, it can restrict when and how the keys are used. For example, it allows the app to require user authentication (for example using a fingerprint) before the key is made available. This is the recommended way to store cryptographic keys on Android.
