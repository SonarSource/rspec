=== What is the potential impact?

If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded is compromised.
Other attacks, such as XSS or code execution, could also occur if other components in the pipeline process the logged data.

==== Log Forge

An attacker inserts bogus data to conceal his malicious activities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) would lead to fake application activities.

==== Code Execution

Sometimes the logged data is consumed by a different downstream component, which improperly assumes the safety of data as it comes from a trusted service. This can lead to code execution as data is left unsanitized and consumed by critical application functionality. A notorious attack, also known as Log4Shell, is an example of such a vector.
