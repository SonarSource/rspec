=== What is the potential impact?

If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded is compromised. +
Other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection, could also occur if the logged data is fed to other vulnerable application components.

==== Log Forge

An attacker inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious activities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of the breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to fake application events.

==== Code Execution

Sometimes the logged data is consumed by a different downstream component, which improperly assumes its safety due to a trusted origin. +
This can lead to various nefarious attacks, such as code injection, as data is left unsanitized and consumed by critical application functionality. +
A notorious vulnerability, also known as Log4Shell, found in the popular Java logging framework Log4j, is an example of such a vector.
