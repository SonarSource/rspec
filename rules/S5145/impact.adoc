=== What is the potential impact?

If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded is compromised. +
Other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection, could also occur if the logged data is feeded to other components in the pipeline.

==== Log Forge

An attacker inserts bogus data to conceal his malicious activities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of a breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to fake application events.

==== Code Execution

Sometimes the logged data is consumed by a different downstream component, which improperly assumes the safety of it as it comes from a trusted service. +
This can lead to code execution as data is left unsanitized and consumed by critical application functionality. A notorious attack, also known as Log4Shell, is an example of such a vector.
