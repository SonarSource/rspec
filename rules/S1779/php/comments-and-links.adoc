I'm removing C, {cpp} and Objective-C from targeted languages since this rule doesn't make sense for me, because:

* Windows users most likely will use CRLF, Linux - LF. That's exactly what we observe in C-Family world.
* Modern version control systems are able to transform code on-the-fly during extraction and commits from/to repository to match OS style of line endings. And Git isn't an exception. Moreover - in such case this rule will generate false-positives.

So what is the source to claim that Git has troubles?


Since origin of rule is PHP - if PHP interpreter has troubles with interpretation of line endings or if there is pitfalls in PHP language, then appropriate description should be done instead of current one.

Alternatively might be better to require consistent line endings of all source files.
