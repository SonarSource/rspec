<p>All developers should use the same end-line character(s) to prevent polluting the history changelog of source files in the SCM engine. Moreover some SCM engines like Git might sometimes badly support use of Windows 'CRLF' end of line characters.</p>

<p>Since origin of rule is PHP - if PHP interpreter has troubles with interpretation of line endings or if there is pitfalls in PHP language, then appropriate description should be done instead of current one.</p>
