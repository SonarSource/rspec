== Why is this an issue?

The PHP 4 method of declaring a variable, using the ``++var++`` keyword, was deprecated in early versions of PHP 5. Even though it's not considered deprecated in the most recent versions, it's nonetheless not best practice to use it. When ``++var++`` does appear, it is interpreted as a synonym for ``++public++`` and treated as such. Therefore ``++public++`` should be used instead.


From the PHP Manual:

____
The PHP 4 method of declaring a variable with the var keyword is still supported for compatibility reasons (as a synonym for the public keyword). In PHP 5 before 5.1.3, its usage would generate an E_STRICT warning.
