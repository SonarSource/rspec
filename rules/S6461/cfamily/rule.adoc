== Why is this an issue?

A _requires-expression_ is used to express constraints on template arguments. 
A basic building block of these constraints is the capability to generate a subexpression whose type depends on a template argument.

The traditional way to write such a subexpression is by using `std::declval<>` (doing something more naive such as `T{}` is not as generic,
for instance, it requires T to be default-constructible). 
This is, however, very verbose and can be error prone: `declval<T>()` yields an expression of type `T&&`, while referencing a variable directly produces an lvalue (`T&`).
This, in many cases, leads to concepts incorrectly requiring only _move-construction_, while copies are made by the implementation.

_Require-expressions_ introduce a more natural way to achieve that. 
When writing a _requires-expression_, it is possible to add a parameter list, similar to function parameters, and these parameters can be used later in the expression.
This syntax is less verbose, more expressive, and less error-prone and should be preferred over calling `std::declval` in requires-expressions.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T>
concept C1 = requires {
  std::declval<T const&>() + // Noncompliant
  std::declval<T const&>(); // Noncompliant
};

template<typename T>
concept C2 = requires {
  std::declval<T const&>() + // Noncompliant
  std::declval<typename T::type const&>(); // Noncompliant
};
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename T>
concept C1 = requires (T const &t) {
  t + t;
};

// Note that if T::type is not a valid expression, no syntax error is
// triggered, the concept will simply not be satisfied
template<typename T>
concept C2 = requires (T const t, typename T::type const u) {
  t + u;
};
