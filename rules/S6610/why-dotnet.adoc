== Why is this an issue?

With `string.StartsWith(char)` and `string.EndsWith(char)`, only the first character of the string is compared to the provided character, making it a faster option. Additionally, it eliminates the need to convert a string parameter to a character array and allocate memory for a new string object, making these operations avoid unnecessary memory allocations. 

These overloads were introduced in `.NET Core 2.0`.
