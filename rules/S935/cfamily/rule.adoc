== Why is this an issue?

When a function does not return an appropriate value, it can cause the program to have an undefined behavior. For example, if a function is supposed to return a value indicating whether a file was successfully opened but does not return any value, the program may continue to execute as if the file was opened successfully, even though it was not. This can lead to data corruption or other issues that are difficult to diagnose.

Functions with a void return type are not expected to return any value. If they do, it may indicate a programming error.

=== Exceptions

The rule does not raise an issue:

* when the `return` statement of a `void` function is a `void` expression.

[source,cpp]
----
void foo() {
  // ...
}

void bar() {
  return foo(); // Compliant by exception
}
----

* for coroutines, introduced in {cpp}20. Coroutines always declare coroutine objects as return types, but the compiler implicitly creates the returned object. The coroutine body never contains a `return` statement, as it is disallowed: if a coroutine returns a value, it will use `co_return`.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int my_func(int a) {
  if (a > 100) {
    return; // Noncompliant
  }

  // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int my_func(int a) {
  if (a > 100) {
    return a;
  }

  if (a > 80) {
    throw new Exception();
  }

  return 0;
}
----
