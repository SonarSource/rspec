== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an exception when the ``++return++`` statement for a ``++void++`` function, is itself a ``++void++`` expression.

----
void foo() {
  // Do stuff ...
}

void bar() {
  return foo();
}
----

Furthermore, the issue is not raised for the coroutines, introduced in {{cpp20}}, that always declare coroutine object as a return type,
but returned object is implicitly created by compiler. The coroutine body itself may never contains `return` statement (the use of it is disallowed),
and `co_return` is used for coroutine that returns a value (define `return_value` in promise-type).
