== Why is this an issue?

When calling the `BeginInvoke` method of a delegate, resources are allocated that are only freed up when `EndInvoke` is called. Failing to pair `BeginInvoke` with `EndInvoke` can lead to resource leaks and incomplete asynchronous calls.

This rule raises an issue in the following scenarios:

* The `BeginInvoke` method is called without any callback, and it is not paired with a call to `EndInvoke` in the same block.
* A callback with a single parameter of type `IAsyncResult` does not contain a call to `EndInvoke` in the same block.
