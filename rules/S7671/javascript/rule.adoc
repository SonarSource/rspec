This rule modifies ESLint's code path analysis and does not report issues itself.

== Why is this an issue?

By default, ESLint's code path analyzer does not treat `process.exit()` calls the same way as `throw` or `return` statements. This means that code appearing after a `process.exit()` call is not marked as unreachable, which can cause other ESLint rules to report false positives.

For example, the `consistent-return` rule might warn about missing return statements in code paths that end with `process.exit()`, even though the process will terminate and never reach the end of the function.

This rule overrides the default code path analyzer to treat `process.exit()` calls as terminating statements, similar to `throw`. When enabled, code after `process.exit()` calls is correctly marked as unreachable, allowing other rules to work as expected.

=== What is the potential impact?

Without this rule, other ESLint rules may produce false positive warnings for code that follows `process.exit()` calls. This can lead to unnecessary code changes or rule suppressions to work around the analyzer's limitations.

=== How to fix?


Enable this rule to modify ESLint's code path analysis. The rule itself does not require any code changes - it automatically treats `process.exit()` calls as terminating statements.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// With this rule disabled, other rules may warn about this code
function foo(condition) {
    if (condition) {
        return 'success';
    } else {
        process.exit(1); // Other rules might not recognize this as terminating
    }
    // ESLint might think this point is reachable
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// With this rule enabled, ESLint correctly understands the control flow
function foo(condition) {
    if (condition) {
        return 'success';
    } else {
        process.exit(1); // Correctly treated as terminating
    }
    // ESLint knows this point is unreachable
}
