You should set a property of type `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` as the primary key of a table only if the date values are guaranteed to be unique.
The rule raises an issue if:
* Entity Framework, or Entity Framework Core dependencies are found; 
* a class contains a `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` property that is either:
** named `Id` or `<type name>Id`.
** decorated by the `[Key]` attribute.
