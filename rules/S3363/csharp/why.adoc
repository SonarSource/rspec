Using a type `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` column as the primary key of a table is slightly risky. Two threads could create new objects in the table close enough in sequence for both to have the same time. 
`DateTime` type is also subject to changes such as daylight saving time (DST) transitions, which can also result in duplicate key exceptions.
