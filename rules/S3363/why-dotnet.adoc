Using the types `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` as the primary key of a table is risky. 
Two threads could create new objects in the table close enough in sequence for both to have the same time.
Moreover, if two entries are added consecutively by the same machine using `.Now` or `.UtcNow` properties, duplicate keys exceptions can occur based on the system clock resolution.
`DateTime` type is also subject to changes such as daylight saving time (DST) transitions, which can also result in duplication.
