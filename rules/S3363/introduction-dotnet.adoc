You should only set a property of type `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` as the primary key of a table if the date values are guaranteed to be unique.
The rule raises an issue if:
* Entity Framework, or Entity Framework Core dependencies are found; 
* a class contains a `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` property that is either named `Id`, `<type name>Id` or decorated by the `[Key]` or `[PrimaryKey]` attribute.
