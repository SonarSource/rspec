== Why is this an issue?

Hard-coding secrets in source code or binaries makes it easy for attackers to extract sensitive information, especially in distributed or open-source applications. This practice exposes credentials and tokens, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

This rule detects strings that look like secrets being hard-coded in the source code.

== How to fix it

Secrets should be stored in a configuration file that is not committed to the code repository, in a database, or managed by your cloud provider's secrets management service. If a secret is exposed in the source code, it must be rotated immediately.


=== Code Examples

==== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,properties,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
api_key=iN1KtmV2xIgdtOs1la7ugo1Pt7gLDjykprJsTELMuULRJQrlBoftwZn92Redve5k // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant Solution

Use placeholders that will be replaced by the actual secret buy the build system or framework, environment variables or a secrets management service in order to not hard-code secrets in the source code.

[source,properties,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
api_key=${MY_API_KEY}
