Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, secrets should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or that are open-source.


In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466[CVE-2019-13466]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389[CVE-2018-15389]

Secrets should be stored outside of the source code in a configuration file or a management service for secrets. 


This rule detects variables/fields having a name matching a list of words (secret, token, api[_.-]?key, credential, auth) being assigned a pseudorandom hard-coded value.
The pseudorandomness of the hard-coded value is based on its entropy. The entropy threshold can be adjusted if needed.
