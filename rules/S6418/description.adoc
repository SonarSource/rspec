Secrets should not be hard-coded in source code, instead be stored outside of the source code in a configuration file or a management service for secrets.

There would be a risk, if any of the following apply to you:

* The secret allows access to a sensitive component like a database, a file storage, an API, or a service.
* The secret is used in a production environment.
* Application re-distribution is required before updating the secret.
