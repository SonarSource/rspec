=== Ask Yourself If

* The secret allows access to a sensitive component like a database, a file storage, an API, or a service.
* The secret is used in a production environment.
* Application re-distribution is required before updating the secret.

There would be a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

=== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Store the secret in a configuration file that is not pushed to the code repository.
* Use your cloud provider's service for managing secrets.
* If a secret has been disclosed through the source code: revoke it and create a new one.
