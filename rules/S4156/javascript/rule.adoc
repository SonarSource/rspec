== Why is this an issue?

Each file is considered an "external" module. The use of the ``++module++`` keyword creates an internal module, and was used before the ECMAScript 2015 addition of ``++namespace++``s for the same purpose. Now that ``++namespace++`` is available, the use of ``++module++`` is deprecated because it does the same thing, and its use could confuse maintainers unaware of the history of the language.
