== Why is this an issue?

Python 3.10 introduced a specific syntax using the "or" operator (`X | Y`) to represent a union of types.
This syntax has the same functionality as `typing.Union`, but it is more concise and easier to read.

Using `typing.Union` is more verbose and less convenient. It can also create inconsistencies when different parts of the codebase use different syntaxes for the same type.

== How to fix it

Replace usages of `typing.Union` with the union type syntax.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
from typing import Union

def foo(arg: Union[int, str]) -> Union[int, str]:
    if isinstance(arg, int):
        return arg + 1
    else:
        return arg.upper()
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
def foo(arg: int | str) -> int | str:
    if isinstance(arg, int):
        return arg + 1
    else:
        return arg.upper()
