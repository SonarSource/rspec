== Why is this an issue?

A synchronized method is a method marked with the `synchronized` keyword, meaning it can
only be accessed by one thread at a time. If multiple threads try to access the synchronized method simultaneously, they
will be blocked until the method is available.

Synchronized methods prevent race conditions and data inconsistencies in multi-threaded environments. Ensuring that only one
thread can access a method at a time, prevents multiple threads from modifying the same data simultaneously, and causing
conflicts.

When one part of a getter/setter pair is `synchronized` the other should be too.
Failure to synchronize both sides may result in inconsistent behavior at runtime as callers access an inconsistent method state.

This rule raises an issue when either the method or the contents of one method in a getter/setter pair are synchronized, but the other is not.

== How to fix it

Synchronize both `get` and `set` methods by marking the method with the `synchronize` keyword or using a `synchronize` block inside them.

=== Code examples
==== Noncompliant code example
[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class Person {
  String name;
  int age; 

  public synchronized void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getName() {  // Noncompliant
    return this.name;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {  // Noncompliant
    this.age = age;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    synchronized (this) {
      return this.age;
    }
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class Person {
  String name;
  int age; 

  public synchronized void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public synchronized String getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    synchronized (this) {
      this.age = age;
   }
  }

  public int getAge() {
    synchronized (this) {
      return this.age;
    }
  }
}
