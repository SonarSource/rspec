Calling methods or fields which are not initialized in constructors or destructors can lead to undefined behavior.


For example:


Calling an overridable member function from a constructor or destructor could result in unexpected behavior when instantiating a subclass which overrides the member function.

* By contract, the subclass class constructor starts by calling the parent class constructor.
* The parent class constructor calls the parent member function and not the one overridden in the child class, which is confusing for child class' developer.
* It can produce an undefined behavior if the member function is pure ``++virtual++`` in the parent class.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class Parent {
  public:
    Parent() {
      method1();
      method2(); // Noncompliant; confusing because Parent::method2() will always been called even if the method is overridden
    }
    Parent(int i):field(i) {}
    virtual ~Parent() {
      method3(); // Noncompliant; undefined behavior (ex: throws a "pure virtual method called" exception)
    }
  protected:
    int field;

    int          method1() { /*...*/ }
    virtual void method2() { /*...*/ }
    virtual void method3() = 0; // pure virtual    
};

class Child : public Parent {
  public:
    Child() { // leads to a call to Parent::method2(), not Child::method2()
    }
    Child() : Parent(field) {} // Noncompliant; "field" is not initialized yet
    Child() : Parent(method1()) {} // Noncompliant; "method1" is not initialized yet
    virtual ~Child() {
      method3(); // Noncompliant; Child::method3() will always be called even if a child class overrides method3
    }
  protected:
    void method2() override { /*...*/ }
    void method3() override { /*...*/ }
};
----

== Compliant Solution

----
class Parent {
  public:
    Parent() {
      method1();
      Parent::method2(); // acceptable but poor design
    }
    virtual ~Parent() {
      // call to pure virtual function removed
    }
  protected:
    void         method1() { /*...*/ }
    virtual void method2() { /*...*/ }
    virtual void method3() = 0;
};

class Child : public Parent {
  public:
    Child() {
    }
    virtual ~Child() {
      method3(); // method3() is now final so this is okay
    }
  protected:
    void method2() override { /*...*/ }
    void method3() final    { /*...*/ } // this virtual function is "final"
};
