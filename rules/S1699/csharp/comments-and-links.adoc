The main difference between C# and Java in this case is that you need to opt in for overridable methods. So you explicitly need to say that ``++DoSomething++`` is ``++virtual++``. So in case of Java you might have just forget to add the ``++final++`` to the method, but in C# you explicitly stated that you are calling and overridable method from the constructor.
