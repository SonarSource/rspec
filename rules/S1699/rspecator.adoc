\[~ann.campbell.2] Other then changing the code sample and removing the "by contract" from the first bullet point, I've added this rule to the SonarQube Way profile. I think this is a really useful rule, which should be enabled by default.


The main difference between C# and Java in this case is that you need to opt in for overridable methods. So you explicitly need to say that ``++DoSomething++`` is ``++virtual++``. So in case of Java you might have just forget to add the ``++final++`` to the method, but in C# you explicitly stated that you are calling and overridable method from the constructor.

During a LaYC sprint, I removed dummy implementations for the following language:

* php
* python
* vbnet

It is not implemented in the corresponding analyzer and there currently are no tickets open in order to do so.
