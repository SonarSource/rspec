== Why is this an issue?

An empty code block may indicate that a piece of code is missing. 

[source,cpp]
----
void foo()
{
  int x;
  if (x == 42)
  // Noncompliant - the following nested block is empty
  {
  }
  else
  {
    doSomething();
  }
}
----

Removing or filling the empty code blocks takes away ambiguity and can improve readability:

[source,cpp]
----
void foo()
{
  int x;
  if (x != 42)  
  {                
    doSomething();
  }
}
----

=== Exceptions

* A code block is not empty when it contains a comment.
* Functions are not nested blocks, so they can be empty.

[source,cpp]
----
void bar()
// Compliant - functions are not nested blocks
{
}
[source,cpp]
