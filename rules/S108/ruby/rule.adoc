== Noncompliant Code Example

----
def compute(a, b)
  sum = a + b
  if  sum > 0 # Noncompliant; empty on purpose or missing piece of code?
  end
  puts "Result: #{sum}"
end
----

== Compliant Solution

----
def compute(a, b)
  sum = a + b
  if  sum > 0
    puts "Positive result"
  end
  puts "Result: #{sum}"
end
----

== Exceptions

When a block contains a comment, this block is not considered to be empty.
``++while++`` and ``++unless++`` loops are also exception to the rule.

----
while @order.process_next; end # Compliant
