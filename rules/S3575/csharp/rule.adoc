== Why is this an issue?

When only a single ``++public++`` parameterless constructor is defined in a class, then that constructor can be removed because the compiler would generate it automatically. Similarly, empty ``++static++`` constructors and empty destructors are also wasted keystrokes.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
class Sample
{ 
  public Sample() { } // Noncompliant
  static Sample() { }  // Noncompliant
  ~Sample() { } // Noncompliant

  ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
class Sample
{ 
  ...
}
----
