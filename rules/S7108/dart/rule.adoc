Variables of type `void` should not be assigned a value.

== Why is this an issue?

Unlike other languages where `void` is the absence of a type (and related value), `void` in Dart is a type, which is not compatible with any other type, since it is conceptually a supertype of `Object`.

Therefore, in Dart it's possible to write the following code:

[source,dart]
----
void x = 3; // A variable of type void can be assigned a value of type int
void f(void x) => x; // A function that takes a void input argument and returns it as output
----

The variable `x` declared above, and the result of `f(x)` are effectively of type `void`. However, while `void` variables can be declared, initialized and even computed, they cannot be used by any function that expects a non-`void` type, by the very definition of `void` type.

[source,dart]
----
print(x); // Error: This expression has type 'void' and can't be used.
print(f(x)); // Error: This expression has type 'void' and can't be used.
----

Therefore, assigning a value to a variable of type `void` is almost certainly the indication of a mistake. 

For example, in the cases where the type is not known, the variable should have not been declared as `void`, but as `dynamic`: 

* `void` variables can be assigned values of any type, but cannot be assigned to any non-`void` variable
* `dynamic`variables, like `void` ones, can be assigned values of any value, and, unlike `void` variables, can be assigned to any non-`dynamic` variable

Notice that, because `void` is a type, it can be used as a valid type parameter for a generic class, and that can lead to indirect or "hidden" `void` assignments:

[source,dart]
----
class Wrapper<T> {
  T value;
  Wrapper(this.value);
}

void main() {
    Wrapper<void> w = Wrapper(3); // This is a "hidden" assignment to void
    w.value = 3; // This is an explicit assignment to a field of type void
}
----

Another example of a "hidden" assignment to `void` is when assigning generic unconstrained type parameters in generic methods:

[source,dart]
----
void f<T>(T x, T y) {
  y = x; // This is a "hidden" assignment to void
  T z;
  z = x; // This too, is a "hidden" assignment to void
}
----

However, such scenarios are not reported by the rule because for any non-`void` type `T`, the assignment is valid. On the other hand, calling the function `f` with anything other than `void` parameters will be reported as an issue:

[source,dart]
----
f(42, 'a string'); // Both 1st and 2nd parameters are non compliant
----

== How to fix it

Identify the scenario leading to the assignment of a value to a variable of type `void` and correct it:

* if the type of the variable is not known, declare it as `dynamic`
* if the type of the variable was mistakenly declared as `void`, replace it with the correct type

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void x; 
x = 3; // Non compliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
dynamic x; // type of x not known
x = 3;
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void x; 
x = 3; // Non compliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
int x; // void mistakenly used instead of the actual type
x = 3;
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Wrapper<void> w = Wrapper(3); // Non compliant
w.value = 3; // Non compliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
Wrapper<int> w = Wrapper(3);
w.value = 3;
----
