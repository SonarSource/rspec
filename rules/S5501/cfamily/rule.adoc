== Why is this an issue?

``++#pragma pack++`` is a non-standard extension that specifies the packing alignment for structure, union, and class members.

It is useful to

* remove padding and decrease the size of objects
* align members to better fit optimal cpu alignment

However, the pragma pack directives need to be correctly defined to work properly.


This rule raises an issue if:

* the specified packing value is incorrect: it can only be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16
* a parameter is ill-formed
* the ``++pop++`` variant of this ``++#pragma++`` is called with both arguments ``++identifier++`` and ``++value++``: such a call is undefined behavior
* a ``++#pragma pack(push...)++`` is performed but there is not corresponding use of ``++#pragma pack(pop...)++``
* a ``++#pragma pack(pop...)++`` is performed but there is not corresponding use of ``++#pragma pack(push...)++``
* a ``++#pragma pack++`` is in effect across several files: this becomes too complex and could easily lead to undefined behavior, the same structure having a different layout when seen from different translation units


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#pragma pack(5) // Noncompliant, value is invalid
#pragma pack(2+2) // Noncompliant, value should be a literal

#pragma pack(4)
#include "myFile.h" // Noncompliant, the specified alignment value will be applied to this file

struct T {
   int i;
   short j;
   double k;
};

#pragma pack(push, r1, 16)
#pragma pack(pop, r1, 4)  // Noncompliant, call to pop with two arguments is undefined

#pragma pack(push, r2, 16) // Noncompliant, call to push with no matching pop
#pragma pack(pop, r3)  // Noncompliant, call to pop with no matching push

#pragma pack(push, 8) // Noncompliant, unmatched push
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#include "myFile.h"

#pragma pack(4)

struct T {
   int i;
   short j;
   double k;
};

#pragma pack(push, r1, 16)
#pragma pack(pop, r1)

#pragma pack(push, r2, 16)
#pragma pack(pop, r2)

#pragma pack(push, 8)
#pragma pack(pop)
