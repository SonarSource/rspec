== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Open the file in an editor that reveals non-ASCII characters and remove all BIDI control characters that are not intended.

If hidden characters are illegitimate, this issue could indicate a potential ongoing attack on the code. Therefore, it would be best to warn your organization's security team about this issue.

Required opening BIDI characters should be explicitly closed with the PDI character.
