== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

This rule detects hard-coded HTTP authentication credentials:

* **URLs with userinfo component**: Credentials embedded in URLs as `http://user:password@host`
* **Basic authentication headers**: Base64-encoded credentials in Authorization headers as `Authorization: Basic <encoded>`

In HTTP requests, basic authentication credentials are encoded by combining the username and password with a colon, then base64-encoding the result. This is sent in the HTTP Authorization header:

[source,text]
----
GET / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=
----

When credentials are hard-coded in source code, they become part of the application's codebase and can be exposed through source code repositories, compiled binaries, or distributed applications.

=== What is the potential impact?

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the authentication credentials.

== How to fix it

// 1. Revoke leaked secrets

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/revoke.adoc[]

// 2. Analyze recent use to identify misuse

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/recent_use.adoc[]

// 3. Use a secret vault in the future

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/vault.adoc[]

// 4. Never hard-code secrets

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
String url = "http://user:password@example.com/api"; // Noncompliant
----

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
conn.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// URL without credentials
String url = "https://example.com/api";
----

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Use token-based authentication from environment
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
String accessToken = System.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN");
conn.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken);
