== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

HTTP URLs may contain a userinfo component that defines credentials (username and optional password) for HTTP authentication. In URLs, this appears as an optional component between the schema and the host, separated by @.

* **URLs with userinfo component**: Credentials embedded in URLs as `http://user:password@host`
* **Basic authentication headers**: Base64-encoded credentials in Authorization headers as `Authorization: Basic <encoded>`

In HTTP requests, basic authentication credentials are encoded by combining the username and password with a colon, then base64-encoding the result. This is sent in the HTTP Authorization header:

[source,text]
----
GET / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=
----

When credentials are hard-coded in source code, they become part of the application's codebase and can be exposed through source code repositories, compiled binaries, or distributed applications.

=== What is the potential impact?

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the {secret_type}.

== How to fix it

// 1. Revoke leaked secrets

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/revoke.adoc[]

// 2. Analyze recent use to identify misuse

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/recent_use.adoc[]

// 3. Use a secret vault in the future

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/vault.adoc[]

// 4. Never hard-code secrets

=== Code examples

The following code examples show hard-coded HTTP authentication credentials that should be avoided.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
String url = "http://user:password@example.com/api"; // Noncompliant
String credentials = "user:password";
String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(credentials.getBytes());
connection.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic " + encoded); // Noncompliant
----

[source,python,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import requests
response = requests.get('http://user:password@example.com/api')  # Noncompliant
response = requests.get(
    'http://example.com/api',
    auth=('user', 'password')  # Noncompliant
)
----

[source,javascript,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const url = 'http://user:password@example.com/api'; // Noncompliant
const credentials = btoa('user:password');
fetch('http://example.com/api', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + credentials  // Noncompliant
  }
});
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
String url = "https://example.com/api";
String accessToken = System.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN");
connection.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken);
----

[source,python,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
import requests
import os

access_token = os.getenv('ACCESS_TOKEN')
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
response = requests.get('https://example.com/api', headers=headers)
----

[source,javascript,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
const accessToken = process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN;
fetch('https://example.com/api', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken
  }
});
