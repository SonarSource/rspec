== Why is this an issue?

Empty implementations of the ``++X509TrustManager++`` interface are often created to allow connection to a host that is not signed by a root certificate authority. Such an implementation will accept any certificate, which leaves the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attacks. The correct solution is to provide an appropriate trust store.


This rule raises an issue when an implementation of ``++X509TrustManager++`` never throws exception.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
class TrustAllManager implements X509TrustManager {

    @Override
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {  // Noncompliant, nothing means trust any client
    }

    @Override
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException { // Noncompliant, this method never throws exception, it means trust any client
        LOG.log(Level.SEVERE, ERROR_MESSAGE);
    }

    @Override
    public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
        return null;
    }
}
