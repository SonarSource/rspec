Program/file names offer only very limited space for indicating program function, which is why you should take advantage of the ability to specify a program ``++TITLE++``. Omitting the ``++TITLE++`` statement will result in a default, uncommunicative ``++TITLE++`` value being printed at the top of each page of the source listing. Instead, you should write an expressive title that gives a clear impression of the program's function. 

This rule raises an issue when a there is no ``++TITLE++`` before the ``++IDENTIFICATION DIVISION++``. Ideally, ``++TITLE++`` will be the first line of a program, but it cannot be placed before compiler options.
