== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default threshold of 3:

----
public def run() {
  prepare("action random1")    // Noncompliant - "action random1" is duplicated 3 times
  execute("action random1")
  release("action random1")
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public def run() {
  val action = "action random1"
  prepare(action)
  execute(action)
  release(action)
}
----

== Exceptions

To prevent generating some false-positives, literals having 5 or less characters are excluded as well as literals containing only letters, digits and '_'.
