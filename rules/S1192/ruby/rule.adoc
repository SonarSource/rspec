== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

To prevent generating some false-positives, literals having 5 or less characters are excluded as well as literals containing only letters, digits and '_'.

== How to fix it

include::../howtofix.adoc[]

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

With the default threshold of 3:

[source,ruby]
----
def foo()
  prepare('action random1')    #Noncompliant - "action random1" is duplicated 3 times
  execute('action random1')
  release('action random1')
end
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby]
----
def foo()
  action1 = 'action random1'
  prepare(action1)
  execute(action1)
  release(action1)
end
----
