include::../howtofix.adoc[]

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

With the default threshold of 3:

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
prepare("a message")  // Noncompliant; duplicated 3 times
execute("a message")
release("a message")
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let message = "a message"

prepare(message)
execute(message)
release(message)
----
