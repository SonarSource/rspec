== Why is this an issue?

You can assign a label to any statement or block of statements. Labels allow you to specify a target location within your code to jump to using the `break` or `continue` statements. However, only `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `switch` statements should be assigned to labels. Using labels can create complex control flow paths, making the code harder to understand. Instead, consider if your code can be refactored so it is clearer and easier to maintain.

[source,javascript]
----
myLabel: if (i % 2 == 0) {  // Noncompliant
  if (i == 12) {
    console.log("12");
    break myLabel;
  }
  console.log("Even number, but not 12");
}
----

Once a label has been defined, it can be used to control the program flow. In the example below, the label is used break out of the loop.

[source,javascript]
----
myLabel: for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {   // Compliant
  console.log("Loop");
  break myLabel;
}
