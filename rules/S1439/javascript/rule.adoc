== Why is this an issue?

You can assign a label to any statement or block of statements. However, only `while`, `do-while`, `for` and `switch` statements should be assigned to labels.  Using labels in any other context it leads to unstructured code that is harder to understand. 

[source,javascript]
----
myLabel: if (i % 2 == 0) {  // Noncompliant
  if (i == 12) {
    console.log("12");
    break myLabel;
  }
  console.log("Even number, but not 12");
}
----

Once a label has been defined, it can be used to control the program flow. In the example below, the label is used break out of the loop.

[source,javascript]
----
myLabel: for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {   // Compliant
  console.log("Loop");
  break myLabel;
}
