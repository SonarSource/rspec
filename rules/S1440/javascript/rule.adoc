=== Exceptions

Even if testing the equality of a variable against null doesn't do exactly what most JavaScript developers believe, usage of ``++==++`` or ``++!=++`` is tolerated in such context. In the following case, if ``++foo++`` hasn't been initialized, its default value is not ``++null++`` but ``++undefined++``. Nevertheless ``++undefined == null++``, so JavaScript developers get the expected behavior.

[source,javascript]

if(foo == null) {...}
