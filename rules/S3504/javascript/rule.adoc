== Why is this an issue?

Variables declared with ``++var++`` are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the entire function in which they are defined. If a variable is declared using ``++var++`` outside of any function, it becomes a global variable and is accessible throughout the entire JavaScript program.


ECMAScript 2015 introduced the ``++let++`` and ``++const++`` keywords for block-scope variable declaration. Using ``++const++`` creates a read-only (constant) variable.


The distinction between the variable types created by ``++var++`` and by ``++let++`` is significant, and a switch to ``++let++`` will help alleviate many of the variable scope issues which have caused confusion in the past. 


Because these new keywords create more precise variable types, they are preferred in environments that support ECMAScript 2015. However, some refactoring may be required by the switch from ``++var++`` to ``++let++``, and you should be aware that they raise ``++SyntaxError++``s in pre-ECMAScript 2015 environments.


This rule raises an issue when ``++var++`` is used instead of ``++const++`` or ``++let++``.

You should declare your variables with either ``++const++`` or ``++let++`` depending on whether you are going to modify them afterwards.

const color = "blue";
let size = 4;

\[~ann.campbell.2] Could you add to the description that ``++let++`` statement declares a *block scope* local variable?

\[~ann.campbell.2] WDYT about "creates a read-only variable" instead of "creates a true, unupdatable constant"?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I would change severity on ``++major++`` and replace ``++confusing++`` on ``++bad-practice++`` or even ``++obsolete++``.

\[~ann.campbell.2] looks good! But IMO code sample in description is excessive, and what you can understand from this code sample is that "let" fails with error but "var" is save and works smoothly :)
