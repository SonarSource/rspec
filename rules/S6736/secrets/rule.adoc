=== Code examples

:example_secret: admin:password
:example_name: amqp-url
:example_env: AMQP_CREDENTIALS 

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("{example_name}", "amqps://{example_secret}@example.com:8080/example")
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("{example_name}", "amqps://"+System.getenv("{example_env}")+"@example.com:8080/example")
