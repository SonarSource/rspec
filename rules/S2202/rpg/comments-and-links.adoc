I think that this rule should also be applied to the following code where the PLIST is implicit:

----
     C                   CALL      'MYPROG'
     C                   PARM                    ZipCode
     C                   PARM                    City
----

In such case, the compliant code would be:

----
     D MYPROG          PR                  ExtPgm('MyProgram')
     D  ZipCode                       5I   Const
     D  City                         20A   Const
     ...
      /free
        MYPROG(ZipCode:City);
      /end-free
----

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] this looks to me like the calling code, rather than the declaration. Once a sub-proc has been specified with a prototype, do you then have the choice of invoking it with a PLIST?

My previous comment was about code calling another program. It seems possible to call a program with a PLIST even if the main procedure of that program is defined with a prototype. I was able to compile and execute something like that.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas], your code samples incorporated (I hope) correctly & minor wording change made in description. See what you think now.


BTW, I 'edited' your comment to be able to copy the code samples, but no actual changes made.

In the second case example code which I provided, the compliant solution has to be understood as a whole: the call to MYPROG in free form uses the prototype which is defined in the D specs. However, in the new version of the rule compliant solution, the comment line "* or in free-format:" seems to indicate that the lines just above and the lines just after are alternatives.


Moreover, in that new version of the compliant solution, the prototype (D specs containing "PR") for "MYPROG" is defined twice.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas], clearly I'm confused. Would you correct the code samples, please?

I think the examples make more sense now.
