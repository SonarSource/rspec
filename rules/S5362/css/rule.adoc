To perform calculations when specifying a CSS property ``++calc()++`` function can be used. This function takes single expression as parameter. When writing this expression some rules must be respected:

* no empty ``++calc()++``
* there should be an operator between the arguments, spacing should be respected
* there should not be any division by zero
* the resolved type should be valid for where the expression is placed

Otherwise ``++calc()++`` function will be invalid and the entire rule using it will be ignored.
