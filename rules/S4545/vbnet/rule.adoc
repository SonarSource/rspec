== Why is this an issue?

The `DebuggerDisplayAttribute` is used to determine how an object is displayed in the debugger window.


The `DebuggerDisplayAttribute` constructor takes a single mandatory argument: the string to be displayed in the value column for instances of the type. Any text within curly braces is evaluated as the name of a field or property, or any complex expression containing method calls and operators.


Naming a non-existent member between curly braces will result in a BC30451 error in the debug window when debugging objects. Although there is no impact on the production code, providing a wrong value can lead to difficulties when debugging the application.


This rule raises an issue when text specified between curly braces refers to members that don't exist in the current context.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
<DebuggerDisplay("Name: {Name}")> ' Noncompliant - Name doesn't exist in this context
Public Class Person

    Public Property FullName As String

End Class
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
<DebuggerDisplay("Name: {FullName}")>
Public Class Person

    Public Property FullName As String

End Class
----
