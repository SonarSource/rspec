== Why is this an issue?

Assigning a value to an imported variable is a poor practice that affects code readability.

Bad practices can cause bugs. When using the reassigned variable, if you are expecting to access the imported value, but are in fact using something else can lead to unexpected behaviour that is hard to debug.

[source,javascript]
----
let { readFile } = require('fs');
readFile = 'hello world!';
----

More importantly, it will cause a runtime error when using ES modules. With TypeScript, it will raise a compilation error.

[source,javascript]
----
import { readFile } from 'fs';
readFile = 'hello world!';   //Noncompliant: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
----

Instead, use constants for `import` and `require`, so that their value is always the same in the scope where they are defined.

[source,javascript]
----
const { readFile } = require('fs');
const text = 'hello world!';
