== Why is this an issue?

A call to the ``++fopen()++``/``++open()++`` function must be matched with a call to ``++fclose()++``/``++close++``. Otherwise, you run the risk of using up all the OS's file handles, which could lock up not just your program but potentially everything on the box.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int fun() {
  FILE *f = fopen("file", "r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    return -1;
  }
  // ...
  return 0; // Noncompliant, file f has not been closed
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int fun() {
  FILE *f = fopen("file", "r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    return -1;
  }
  // ...
  fclose(f);
  return 0;
}
----
