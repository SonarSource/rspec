== Exceptions

Instances of the following classes are ignored by this rule because ``close`` has no effect:

* ``java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream``
* ``java.io.ByteArrayInputStream``
* ``java.io.CharArrayReader``
* ``java.io.CharArrayWriter``
* ``java.io.StringReader``
* ``java.io.StringWriter``

Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement, which implicitly closes ``Closeables``. All resources opened in a try-with-resources statement are ignored by this rule.
