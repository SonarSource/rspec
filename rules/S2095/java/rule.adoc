=== Exceptions

Instances of the following classes are ignored by this rule because ``++close++`` has no effect:

* ``++java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream++``
* ``++java.io.ByteArrayInputStream++``
* ``++java.io.CharArrayReader++``
* ``++java.io.CharArrayWriter++``
* ``++java.io.StringReader++``
* ``++java.io.StringWriter++``

Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement, which implicitly closes ``++Closeables++``. All resources opened in a try-with-resources statement are ignored by this rule.

try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
