== Why is this an issue?

Connections, streams, files, and other classes that implement the ``++Closeable++`` interface or its super-interface, ``++AutoCloseable++``, needs to be closed after use. Further, that ``++close++`` call must be made in a ``++finally++`` block otherwise an exception could keep the call from being made. Preferably, when class implements ``++AutoCloseable++``, resource should be created using "try-with-resources" pattern and will be closed automatically.


Failure to properly close resources will result in a resource leak which could bring first the application and then perhaps the box the application is on to their knees.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
private void readTheFile() throws IOException {
  Path path = Paths.get(this.fileName);
  BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path, this.charset);
  // ...
  reader.close();  // Noncompliant
  // ...
  Files.lines("input.txt").forEach(System.out::println); // Noncompliant: The stream needs to be closed
}

private void doSomething() {
  OutputStream stream = null;
  try {
    for (String property : propertyList) {
      stream = new FileOutputStream("myfile.txt");  // Noncompliant
      // ...
    }
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // ...
  } finally {
    stream.close();  // Multiple streams were opened. Only the last is closed.
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
private void readTheFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
    Path path = Paths.get(fileName);
    try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
      reader.readLine();
      // ... 
    }
    // ..
    try (Stream<String> input = Files.lines("input.txt"))  {
      input.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

private void doSomething() {
  OutputStream stream = null;
  try {
    stream = new FileOutputStream("myfile.txt");
    for (String property : propertyList) {
      // ...
    }
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // ...
  } finally {
    stream.close();
  }
}
----


=== Exceptions

Instances of the following classes are ignored by this rule because ``++close++`` has no effect:

* ``++java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream++``
* ``++java.io.ByteArrayInputStream++``
* ``++java.io.CharArrayReader++``
* ``++java.io.CharArrayWriter++``
* ``++java.io.StringReader++``
* ``++java.io.StringWriter++``

Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement, which implicitly closes ``++Closeables++``. All resources opened in a try-with-resources statement are ignored by this rule. 

[source,java]
----
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
  //...
}
catch ( ... ) {
  //...
}
