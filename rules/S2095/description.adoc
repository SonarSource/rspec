Connections, streams, files, and other classes that implement the `+Closeable+` interface or its super-interface, `+AutoCloseable+`, needs to be closed after use. Further, that `+close+` call must be made in a `+finally+` block otherwise an exception could keep the call from being made. Preferably, when class implements `+AutoCloseable+`, resource should be created using "try-with-resources" pattern and will be closed automatically.

Failure to properly close resources will result in a resource leak which could bring first the application and then perhaps the box the application is on to their knees.
