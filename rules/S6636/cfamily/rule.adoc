== Why is this an issue?

When a regular function throws an exception, stack unwinding occurs.
This applies to exceptions thrown within the function body or from an inner function call.


{cpp}20 introduced coroutines, a stackless method to invoke functions that can be suspended and resumed.
As coroutines have no stack, exceptions behave differently across a coroutine boundary.


The _Promise object_ of any coroutine is required to have an `unhandled_exception` function.
If an exception escapes the coroutine function body, the `unhandled_exception` function is called, and the coroutine reaches the final-suspend point.
Resuming the coroutine after this point is undefined behavior.


The `unhandled_exception` method is used to define such behavior.
The exception can be obtained with `std::current_exception` and can be logged, rethrown, or stored:

- If rethrown, the exception will be received in any thread that resumes the coroutine.
- If stored, it can be propagated through the _Promise object_ to the awaiter.
- If no exceptions were expected from the coroutine, the program can be terminated.

Choosing an approach depends on the coroutine use-case.
Also, keep in mind the following:

- Rethrowing in `unhandled_exception` will cause the coroutine to reach the final-suspend point without calling `final_suspend` first.
- A `noexcept` specified coroutine will only terminate the program if an exception is thrown from the _Promise type_'s construction.
This happens because the coroutine internal mechanisms wrap the coroutine body in a `try-catch` block.
To enforce `noexcept` on a coroutine, the program should be terminated in the promise_type `unhandled_exception` function.

----
struct Task {
  struct promise_type {
    /* ... */
    void unhandled_exception() {}

=== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct Task {
  struct promise_type {
    void unhandled_exception() {
      /* ... */
      except = std::current_exception(); // store exception
    }

    std::exception_ptr except; // awaiter can check and obtain it via promise()
  };
};
