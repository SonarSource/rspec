== Why is this an issue?

In most logging frameworks, it's good practice to set the logger name to match its enclosing type, as enforced by S3416.

Logging frameworks can define or use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/interfaces[Generic interfaces] for the logger, such as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1[`ILogger<TCategoryName>`]. 

The use of a logger of a generic type parameter `A` (e.g. `ILogger<A>`) in a type different than `A`, say `B`, goes against the convention, and can result in the same issues described in S3416.

This happens because the instance of type `A` would log with a logger named after `B`, and log items would appear as if they were logged by `B` instead.

This rule specifically targets the generic logging interface https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1[`ILogger<TCategoryName>` Interface] defined by https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging[Microsoft Extensions Logging].
