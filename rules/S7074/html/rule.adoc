== How to fix it

=== Code examples

To fix the `webSecurity` flag vulnerability in Electron applications, you should not use the `disablewebsecurity` attribute for `webview` tags. The security restrictions on web content loaded by your application are enabled per default.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,html,diff-id=11,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<webview disablewebsecurity src="page.html"></webview><!-- noncompliant -->
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,html,diff-id=11,diff-type=compliant]
----
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
----

=== How does this work?

The compliant example does not disable `websecurity`. The default setting is secure.
