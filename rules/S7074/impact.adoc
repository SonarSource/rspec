=== What is the potential impact?

When the `webSecurity` flag is disabled, it opens the door to various types of attacks that can compromise the integrity and security of the application and its users.

==== Code Execution

When the `webSecurity` flag is off, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application and execute arbitrary code. 
These scripts can steal sensitive information such as user credentials or sessions, personal data, and financial information.
This can lead to identity theft and financial loss for users.

==== Phishing Attacks

With the `webSecurity` flag disabled, attackers can create convincing phishing pages within the application. 
These pages can trick users into providing sensitive information, believing they are interacting with a legitimate part of the application.
