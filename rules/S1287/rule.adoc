A paragraph that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such paragraphs inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller paragraphs which focus on well-defined tasks. Those smaller paragraphs will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
