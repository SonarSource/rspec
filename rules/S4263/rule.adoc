Microsoft's MSVC has a search strategy which differs from other compilers when resolving quoted include directives <code>#include "file.h"</code>. Relying on such a strategy is not portable and may lead to compilation failure when trying to build with a different compiler.

This rule raises an issue whenever the file specified in a <code>#include</code> directive can only be found using the MSVC search strategy.
