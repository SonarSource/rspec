== Why is this an issue?

Microsoft's MSVC has a search strategy which differs from other compilers when resolving quoted include directives ``++#include "file.h"++``. Relying on such a strategy is not portable and may lead to compilation failure when trying to build with a different compiler.


This rule raises an issue whenever the file specified in a ``++#include++`` directive can only be found using the MSVC search strategy.
