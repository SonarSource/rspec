This rule reports an issue when the use of ``++std::move++`` prevents the copy elision optimizations from happening.

== Why is this an issue?

Usually, when copying an object, the source object is unchanged, 
meaning all resources owned by the source objects must be duplicated during the copy operation. 
If the source object is no longer used, this duplication is inefficient. 
Since {cpp}11, a move semantic mechanism has been added to detect such cases and replace the expensive copy with a much cheaper move operation that will transfer resources.

The cornerstone of move semantics is detecting during a "copy" whether the source object will be reused or not. 
This can be done explicit by the user, by invoking a `std::move` (or different cast to rvalue) on the object.
In such case the user promises to the compiler that they won't care for the object's current value any longer.
In addition to that the compile will use move, or skip coping of the object in some situations.

Firstly, the copy will be elided (not performed) or automatically turned into move operation,
when the temporary object of type `T` is used to initialize a parameter or variable of type `T` or `const T`, 
or returned from the function that declares `T` or `const T` as return type:
[source,cpp]
----
class A {/* ... */};
A create();

void asParam(A a);

A returnedFromFunc() {
  // For all below examples, the object will not be copied,
  // and either the no copy or move will be performed (as optimization, that is guaranteed since C++17)
  // or move operation will be used.
  A a = create();
  asParam(createA()); 
  return A();
}
----

Calling `std::move` on such object is not only necessary, but will also prevent compiler from performing (inhibit) copy elision,
and the rule raises issues in that case.
[source,cpp]
----
class A {/* ... */};
A create();

void asParam(A a);

A returnedFromFunc() {
  // Move operations needs to be peformed, and cannot be elided.
  A a = std::move(create()); // Noncomplaint
  asParam(createA());        // Noncomplaint
  return A();                // Noncomplaint
}
----

Secondly, under certain conditions the local variable or function parameter is implicit moved,
if it is directly returned (`return x`) from the function.
In particular, when a variable of type `T` is returned direclty from the function that declares `T` or `const T`
as a return type:
[source,cpp]
----
class A {/* ... */};

A returnedLocalVar() {
  A a = create();
  // Variable a is automatically moved here
  return a;
}
----

This conditions overlaps with the conditions under which copy elision optimization,
refered as Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) can be performed by compiler. 
When this optimization is applied the local variable is returned without any copy or move operation being performed.
In this case adding `std::move` to the return statment will inhibit this optimization,
and the rule raises an issues.
[source,cpp]
----
class A {/* ... */};

A returnedLocalVar() {
  A a = create();
  // Variable a is moved, but NRVO cannot be perforedm
  return std::move(a); // Noncomplaint
}
----


=== What if my class does not have move constructr?

=== What if pass to function accepting rvalue parameters?


=== Why the is is not raised for all redundant moves?

The requirments from performing an implcit move where relaxed in {cpp}20 and {cpp}23 standards,
with some of them being applied retroactively.
As consequence depending on the language and compiler, 
a call to `std::move` may or not redundant in return statment,
and thus required for the code to be portable accross compilers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class A {};
A getA();

A f() {
  A a = std::move(getA()); // Noncompliant, prevents copy elision
  std::vector<A> v;
  v.push_back(std::move(getA())); // Noncompliant
  return std::move(a); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class A {};
A getA();

A f() {
  A a = getA(); // Compliant
  std::vector<A> v;
  v.push_back(getA()); // Compliant
  return a; // Compliant
}
