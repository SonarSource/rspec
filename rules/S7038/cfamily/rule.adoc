Uses of `std::strstream` and `std::ostrstream` should be replaced with:

 * `std::stringstream` and `std::ostringstream` to use dynamically allocated buffer
 * `std::spanstream` and `std::ospanstream` to use preallocated buffer.

Uses of `std::istrstream` should be replaced with `std::ispanstream`.

== Why is this an issue?

The input `std::istrstream`, output `std::ostrstream`, and combined `std::iostream` stream classes
are deprecated since their introduction in the {cpp}98 standard.

Those stream classes support two use cases, and their behavior differs vastly depending
on how the object is constructed:

* When constructed without argument, the stream object manages a dynamically allocated buffer;
* When constructed from ``++char*++`` buffer and size, the stream object uses only the provided buffer.

The above behaviors make the `strstream` classes hard to use correctly.
As illustration the `str()` member function:

* returns a buffer that has unclear ownership;
* does not return the size of readable characters nor guarantees null-termination of the buffer;
* may leak unless `freeze(false)` is called afterwards.
 
With the introduction of the `std::spanstream`, `std::ispanstream` and `std::ospanstream` {cpp}23,
all uses of the `std::strstream`, `std::ostrstream` and `std::ispanstream` classes may be replaced,
with one of the following classes:

* `std::stringstream` and `std::ostringstream` to use managed and growing buffer,
* `std::spanstream`, `std::ospanstream` and `std::ispanstream` to use preallocated buffer with fixed size.


This rule will raise an issue when the new object of `strstream` is created:

[source,cpp]
----
std::string printData(std::string_view entry, int count) {
  std::ostrstream os; // Noncompliant
  os << "The entry '" << entry << "' was repeated " << count << " times." << std::ends;
  char const* content = os.str();
  os.freeze(false);
  return std::string(content);
}

int readInt(std::istrstream);

void process() {
  readInt(std::istrstream("10")); // Noncompliant
}
----

Furthermore, the issue will be raised if a data member of the class is declared with one of `strstream` types:

[source,cpp]
----
class Printer {
  /* .... */
private:
  std::ostrstream os; // Noncompliant
};
----

== How to fix it

To fix the code you should change the type of the highlighted data member, field, or object as follows:

* `std::strstream` to `std::stringstream` or `std::spanstream`
* `std::ostrstream` to `std::ostringstream` or `std::ospanstream`,
* `std::isstrstream` to `std::ispanstream`.


=== Replacing output streams with dynamic buffers

When a `std::strstream` or `std::ostrstream` is using a dynamically allocated growing buffer (i.e., it was constructed without arguments), 
it should be replaced with `std::stringstream` and `std::ostringstream`, respectively.

With this change, the type of the `str()` member function will change from the C-string ``++char const*++`` of unclear size and ownership to a well-managed `std::string`.
Furthermore, when extracting the content is the last operation of the stream,
you may call `std::move` on the stream before calling `str()` to avoid copying and allocating a new buffer.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
std::string printData(std::string_view entry, int count) {
  std::ostrstream os; // Noncompliant
  os << "The entry '" << entry << "' was repeated " << count << " times." << std::ends;
  char const* content = os.str();
  os.freeze(false);
  return std::string(content);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
std::string printData(std::string_view entry, int count) {
  std::ostringstream os; // Compliant
  os << "The entry '" << entry << "' was repeated " << count << " times." << std::ends;
  return std::move(os).str();
}
----


=== Replacing output streams with preallocated buffers

When the `std::strstream` or `std::ostrstream` is used to put a string
into a preallocated buffer, the same behavior can be preserved by using `std::spanstream` and `std::ospanstream`, respectively.

Their constructors accept a `std::span<char>` instead of a pair of pointer and size.
Furthermore, the `str()` member function should be replaced with the `span()` member function, which returns the written range.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
std::string_view formatDateTo(int y, int m, int d, std::span<char> buffer) {
  std::ostrstream os(buffer.data(), buffer.size()); // Noncompliant
  os << y << "/"  << m << "/" << d << std::ends;

  char const* data = os.str();
  // Avoid buffer overflow, if the size of the buffer was not sufficient,
  // by using POSIX 'strnlen(p, n)' function that will return `n` if
  // null-terminator is not found in first `n` bytes of buffer pointed
  // by `p`.
  std::size_t n = strnlen(data, buffer.size());
  return std::string_view(data, n);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
std::string_view formatDateTo(int y, int m, int d, std::span<char> buffer) {
  std::ospanstream os(buffer); // Compliant
  os << y << "/"  << m << "/" << d;
  return std::string_view(os.span());
}
----

We can avoid null-terminating the buffer (using `std::ends`), as `span()` provides both the pointer and the number of written characters.

==== Avoiding truncation of content

With both `std::ostrstream` and `std::ospanstream`, the output is trimmed when the size of the buffer is insufficient for the content. 
If using a preallocated buffer is not strictly necessary for performance reasons, you should consider using a `stringstream`.

[source,cpp]
----
std::string formatDate(int y, int m, int d) {
  std::ostringstream os; // Compliant
  os << y << "/"  << m << "/" << d << std::ends;
  return std::move(os).str();
}
----

=== Replacing input streams

`std::ispanstream` should be used instead of `std::istrstream` to parse the content of a buffer.
This requires converting the input arguments to `std::span<const char>` which can be performed as follows:

  * `std::span(ptr, size)` if `std::istrstream` was constructed from pointer `ptr` and `size`;
  * `std::string_view(cstr)` if `std::istrstream` was constructed from null-terminated C-string `cstr`.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int sum1(char const* buffer, int size) {
  int x, y;
  std::istrstream is(buffer, size); // Noncompliant
  is >> x >> y;
  return x + y;
}

int sum2(char const* cstr) {
  int x, y;
  std::istrstream is(cstr); // Noncompliant
  is >> x >> y;
  return x + y;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
int sum1(char const* buffer, int size) {
  int x, y;
  std::ispanstream is{std::span(buffer, size)}; // Compliant
  is >> x >> y;
  return x + y;
}

int sum2(char const* cstr) {
  int x, y;
  std::ispanstream is{std::string_view(cstr)}; // Compliant
  is >> x >> y;
  return x + y;
}
----


=== Fixing issue incrementally

When the modified object is passed to a function, you may also need to adjust its signature.
This, in turn, may require modifying other call sites of the given function and lead to large refactorings.
In this section, we discuss a few options to mitigate the scale of the changes.

==== Passing reference to base class

When the body of the function does not use any functionality specific to `strstream` type,
the best option may be to change the parameter to the reference to the corresponding base class:

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void print(std::ostrstream& os, int n) {
  os << n;
  /* More streaming operations */
}
----

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
void print(std::ostream& os, int n) {
  os << n;
  /* More streaming operations */
}
----
 
This change allows the above function to be invoked with `stream`, `spanstream`, and `stringstream`.

==== Introducing separate overloads

If the called function uses `strstream` specific functionality  (like calling `str()`),
adding additional overload for corresponding `stringstream` or `spanstream` allows incremental improvements of the code.

To reduce code duplication, extract parts of the function that are not dependent on the `strstream` specific
functionalities into a helper function that accepts a reference to the corresponding base class.

[source,cpp]
----
void finalizeImpl(std::ostream& os) {
  // Part that is not dependent on the type of stream
}
 
std::string finalize(std::ostrstream os) {
  finalizeImpl(os);

  os << std::ends;
  char const* data = os.str();
  os.freeze(false);
  return data;
}

std::string finalize(std::stringstream os) {
  finalizeImpl(os);
  
  return std::move(os).str();
}
----
