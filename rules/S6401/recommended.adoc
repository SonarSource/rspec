== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to rotate keys automatically and regularly. The shorter the key period, the less data can be decrypted by an attacker if a key is compromised. So the key rotation period usually depends on the amount of data encrypted with a key or other requirements such as compliance with security standards. In general, a period of time of 90 days can be used.
