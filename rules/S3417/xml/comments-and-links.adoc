\[~michael.gumowski] it is possible that this should be a rule template (to allow customization of the message per dependency) rather than a rule with parameters. WDYT?

Now, I'm just wondering about the best format of the parameters, and I really wonder what should be the best one to use. Maybe we need to define it a bit more explicitly, as usually, we define dependencies with a groupId and an artifactId (``++groupId:artifactId++``).


For instance you may want to allow all the dependencies from ``++X.Y.Z++``, but absolutely forbid ``++X.Y.Z:A++``, or forbid only a given version of an artifact, or more complex, a range of version!


I would then say that, by default, you are providing as parameter the groupId to forbid, if usage of column (``++:++``), then it's a given artifact, which can follow patterns (``++*:*.log4j++`` ?). For the versions, I have no idea how explicitly mention it however, but I'm pretty sure it's required. Any idea?
