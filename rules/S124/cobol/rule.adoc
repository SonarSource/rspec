This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when a comment matches a given regular expression.

For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression ``++REVIEW++`` to match all comment containing "REVIEW".


Note that, in order to match REVIEW regardless of the case, the ``++(?i)++`` modifier should be prepended to the expression, as in ``++(?i)REVIEW++``.
