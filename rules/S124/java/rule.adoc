This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when the full content of a comment matches a given regular expression. Note that the regular expression should be expressed using the dotall format (where the ``++.++`` character matches any character).


For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression ``++.*REVIEW.*++`` to match all comment containing "REVIEW".


Note that, in order to match REVIEW regardless of the case, the ``++(?i)++`` modifier should be prepended to the expression, as in ``++(?i).*REVIEW.*++``.
