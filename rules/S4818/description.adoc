Using sockets is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1785[CVE-2011-178]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5645[CVE-2017-5645]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6597[CVE-2018-6597]

Sockets are vulnerable in multiple ways:
* They enable a software to interact with the outside world. As this world is full of attackers it is necessary to check that they cannot receive sensitive information or inject dangerous input.
* The number of sockets is limited and can be exhausted. Which makes the application unresponsive to users who need additional sockets.

This rules flags code that creates sockets. It matches only the direct use of sockets, not use through frameworks or high-level APIs such as the use of  http connections.
