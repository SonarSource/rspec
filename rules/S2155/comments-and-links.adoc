Note, no overlap is intended with RSPEC-1196

I don't see the difference with RSPEC-1196 : if you have cycle between classes you will have a cycle between package. 

If both classes are at the same package level, then I don't see why you should not do something like that. This is valid code and I don't see any special issue that won't be covered by 1196.
