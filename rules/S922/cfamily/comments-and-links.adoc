It looks strange for me that

{noformat}

j = sizeof( isPtr(e) );

{noformat}

considered as compliant. And seems that this example comes from MISRA.

\[~massimo.paladin] any thoughts?

I can't find such example in MISRA, the only mentioned exception is:

An expression of the form sizeof ( V ), where V is an lvalue with a volatile qualified type that is not a variable-length array, is permitted.

We should probably update the example, WDYT?

\[~massimo.paladin] yes, I agree that we should update. And maybe even description. Also check that implementation is good. Could you please take care of this? ;)
