== Why is this an issue?

This rule is a strict implementation of a MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) rule. MISRA defines best practices for developing safety-critical software. You can learn more about this rule in the MISRA documents referenced below.


If you are not concerned with MISRA compliance or with safety-critical software, you might consider using rule S3135 instead ; it targets the same kind of issue for general-purpose software.


== Resources

* MISRA C 2004, 12.3 - The sizeof operator shall not be used on expressions that contain side effects.
* MISRA {cpp} 2008, 5-3-4 - Evaluation of the operand to the sizeof operator shall not contain side effects.
* MISRA C 2012, 13.6 - The operand of the sizeof operator shall not contain any expression which has potential side effects

\[~ann.campbell.2] implementation seems more complete (SQALE, description) than this spec.

It looks strange for me that

{noformat}

j = sizeof( isPtr(e) );

{noformat}

considered as compliant. And seems that this example comes from MISRA.

\[~massimo.paladin] any thoughts?

I can't find such example in MISRA, the only mentioned exception is:

____
An expression of the form sizeof ( V ), where V is an lvalue with a volatile qualified type that is not a variable-length array, is permitted.

____

We should probably update the example, WDYT?

\[~massimo.paladin] yes, I agree that we should update. And maybe even description. Also check that implementation is good. Could you please take care of this? ;)

Un-deprecated, because is exactly matches the MISRA specification...
