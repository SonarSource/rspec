Except for templated code, brace initialization should be preferred over {cpp}20's parenthesis initialization for aggregates.

== Why is this an issue?

With {cpp}20, it is now possible to initialize aggregate types using parentheses.
This language feature was introduced to simplify writing generic code and consistently initialize objects, whether they are aggregates or not.

For the sake of simplicity, aggregate types include arrays, unions, and structures without user-declared constructors and with only public non-static data members and public bases.

Initializing objects with parentheses has several downsides compared to braces.

 * Firstly, they allow narrowing conversion of arithmetic types that can result in unexpected program behaviors. See also S5276.

 * Secondly, they can result in the most vexing parse.
   For example, ``++Aggregate a(std::string());++`` declares function, while ``++Aggregate a{std::string()};++`` declares a variable.

 * Furthermore, using braces is idiomatic and consistent with C.

For all these reasons, braces should be preferred for non-generic code when initializing aggregates.
And the fix is often trivial: replace the parentheses `()` with braces `{}`.

Here is a noncompliant example:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct Coordinate {
  int x;
  int y;
};

long readInteger();

auto readCoordinate() {
  // Be aware of the narrowing conversions on the next line.
  return Coordinate(readInteger(), readInteger()); // Noncompliant
}
----

There are multiple ways of handling the narrowing conversion; here is one alternative:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct Coordinate {
  int x;
  int y;
};

long readInteger();

auto readCoordinate() {
  // Explicitly handle the conversion:
  // Here, we saturate, but throwing an exception may also be appropriate.
  auto readInt = []() { return saturate_cast<int>(readInteger()); };
  return Coordinate{readInt(), readInt()}; // Compliant
}
----

=== Can the issue be raised for cast to Aggregate?

When `static_cast` (`static_cast<T>(arg)`) or _c-style_ cast (`(T)arg`) is used to cast value `arg` to some type `T`,
such cast can be resolved to the constructor call in form `T(arg)`.
With {cpp}20 such syntax is well-formed, when `T` is an aggregate and will initialize it's first element from `arg`.
This rule will raise an issue for such cast expression.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
};

auto p1 = Point(1);               // Noncompliant
auto p2 = (Point)1;               // Noncompliant, same as Point(1)
auto p3 = static_cast<Point>(1);  // Noncomplaint, same as Point(1)
----

Such issues can be fixed by replacing the cast expression, with construction of temporary object using braces (`{}`):

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
};

auto p1 = Point{1};  // Compliant
auto p2 = Point{1};  // Compliant
auto p3 = Point{1};  // Complaint 
----

 
=== Exceptions

_Value-initialization_ with `()` (i.e., with no arguments) is unrelated to _aggregate-initialization_ and is accepted.
As such are no arguments, no narrowing conversions are possible in such situation.

// There are also edge cases not worth covering or even mentioning here.
//
// Example: having a member with an explicit default constructor does not compile.
// https://godbolt.org/z/exerMGM9x

[source,cpp]
----
Coordinate function(); // Irrelevant -- this is a function declaration.

auto variable = Coordinate(); // Value-initialization - compliant by exception.

struct Object {
  Coordinate coord;
  Object() : coord() { } // Value-initialization - compliant by exception.
};
----
