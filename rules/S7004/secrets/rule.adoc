=== What is the potential impact?

Application keys and secrets allow applications to authenticate with Huawei
Cloud services. If an application secret is disclosed, an attacker will be able
to call Huawei Cloud resources with the same privileges as the application.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/phishing.adoc[]

==== Financial loss

Cloud providers charge for their services based on their usage. This may be
based on the number of API calls made, bandwidth, or how many server instances
are running.

An attacker can use a disclosed secret to send large numbers of requests to the
cloud provider. This can lead to a large and unexpected increase in cloud
provider costs.

==== Denial of service

The cloud provider may monitor requests to identify unusual usage activity. If
an attacker is able to send enough requests, the cloud provider may flag your
account and take action against it. This could lead to the suspension or
termination of your account, thus causing significant inconvenience and
disruption for your customers or partners.
