== Why is this an issue?

``++emplace++`` enables you to avoid copying or moving the value you are about to insert and, instead, it constructs it in-place with the arguments provided.


Prefer using ``++emplace++``, or ``++emplace_hint++`` if all the conditions hold:

* You are inserting a single value.
* You are constructing a fresh temporary value just to insert it into the set.
* You expect that the key is not in the set.

You should keep the ``++insert++`` in any of the cases below:

* You are inserting multiple values in one shot.
* You are inserting a pre-existing value that is constructed for another purpose.
* You are inserting an object that is cheap to move or to copy (e.g., an integer).
* The key you are inserting is likely to be in the set (in this case by using ``++insert++`` you avoid creating a useless temporary node).

This rule detects calls to ``++insert++`` that lead to the creation of a large temporary object that can be avoided by using the ``++emplace++`` member function.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  int x;
  std::array<std::string, 100> more;// Expensive to copy or move
public:
  A(int x, const std::string& more) : x(x), more({more}) {}
  bool operator<(A const &other) const {
    return x < other.x;
  }
};
std::array<std::string, 3> strs = {"big brown fox", "little kitten", "regular human"};
void f() {
  std::set<A> set;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1'000'000; ++i) {
    set.insert(A{i, strs[i%3]});// Noncompliant
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  int x;
  std::array<std::string, 100> more;// Expensive to copy or move
public:
  A(int x, const std::string& more) : x(x), more({more}) {}
  bool operator<(A const &other) const {
    return x < other.x;
  }
};
std::array<std::string, 3> strs = {"big brown fox", "little kitten", "regular human"};
void f() {
  std::set<A> set;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1'000'000; ++i) {
    set.emplace(i, strs[i%3]);// Compliant
  }
}
----


=== Exceptions

You should keep ``++insert++`` for exception safety if your key type is a smart pointer and the argument is a new expression.
