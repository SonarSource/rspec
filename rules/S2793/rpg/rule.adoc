``++QUALIFIED++`` data structures result in cleaner code because you can't reference the fields without using the qualifying name. They also  allow you to have multiple sub-fields with the same name, meaning subfield names don't have to be convoluted for uniqueness, and can be expressive instead.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
      * Noncompliant
     D Employee        DS
     D  EmpId                         7P 0
     D  EFName                       30A
     D  ELName                       30A
     D  EPhone                       11P 0

      * Noncompliant
     D Contractor      DS
     D  CntId                         7P 0
     D  CFName                       30A
     D  CLName                       30A
     D  CPhone                       11P 0

      /free
        EmpId = '000220';
      /end-free
