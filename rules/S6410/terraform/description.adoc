TLS configuration of Google Cloud load balancers are defined through SSL policies. There are three managed profiles to choose from: COMPATIBLE (default), MODERN and RESTRICTED.
The COMPATIBLE profile enables weak cipher suites and should not be used by applications that enforce the best security standards.

Choosing MODERN or RESTRICTED profile will disable cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. This key exchange is weak because it doesn't provide forward secrecy.
In practice, forward secrecy prevents attackers from decrypting communication that happened in the past if the server's private key is ever compromised.
