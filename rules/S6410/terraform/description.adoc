TLS configuration of Google Cloud load balancers is defined through SSL policies. There are three managed profiles to choose from: ``++COMPATIBLE++`` (default), ``++MODERN++`` and ``++RESTRICTED++``:

* The ``++RESTRICTED++`` profile relies only on secure cipher suites and should be used by applications that require to comply with the highest security standards.  
* The ``++MODERN++`` profile includes additional cipher suites that present security weaknesses like using the ``++SHA1++`` algorithm for signing.
* The ``++COMPATIBLE++`` profile offers the most common cipher suites and thus broader compatibility. Some of these use ``++SHA1++`` or ``++3DES++`` algorithms which are considered weak. Also, this profile includes cipher suites that rely on obsolete key-exchange mechanisms that don't provide forward secrecy[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy] as a feature.
