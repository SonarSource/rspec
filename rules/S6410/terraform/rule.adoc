== Why is this an issue?

TLS configuration of Google Cloud load balancers is defined through SSL policies. There are three managed profiles to choose from: ``++COMPATIBLE++`` (default), ``++MODERN++`` and ``++RESTRICTED++``:

* The ``++RESTRICTED++`` profile relies only on secure cipher suites and should be used by applications that require to comply with the highest security standards.  
* The ``++MODERN++`` profile includes additional cipher suites that present security weaknesses like using the ``++SHA1++`` algorithm for signing.
* The ``++COMPATIBLE++`` profile offers the most common cipher suites and thus broader compatibility. Some of these use ``++SHA1++`` or ``++3DES++`` algorithms which are considered weak. Also, this profile includes cipher suites that rely on obsolete key-exchange mechanisms that don't provide forward secrecy[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy] as a feature.


=== Noncompliant code example
[source,terraform]
----
resource "google_compute_ssl_policy" "example" {
  name            = "example"
  min_tls_version = "TLS_1_2" 
  profile         = "COMPATIBLE" # Noncompliant
}
----

=== Compliant solution
[source,terraform]
----
resource "google_compute_ssl_policy" "example" {
  name            = "example"
  min_tls_version = "TLS_1_2" 
  profile         = "RESTRICTED"
}

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

==== GCP

* If `profile` is specified but has the wrong value
** Change this code to disable support of weak cipher suites.

* If `profile` is not specified at all
** Set profile to disable support of weak cipher suites.


=== Highlighting

For `google_compute_ssl_policy`:

* Highlight `profile` if it is specified but has the wrong value
* Highlight resource if `profile` is not specified at all
