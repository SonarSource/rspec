== How to fix it

In order to improve performance, consider moving the `Regex` constructor call outside of the method scope and ensuring that it is only instantiated once.

Here are some suggestions for optimizing performance when extracting the `Regex`:

* Consider defining a read-only field or property in your class.
* When creating the Regex, consider including the `RegexOptions.Compiled` flag.
* If you are using NET 7.0+, consider using the `[GeneratedRegex]` attribute to generate an optimized implementation of the specified regular expression.

One compliant alternative when unable to extract the Regex is to use the static method `Regex.IsMatch`. Be aware, by default, the last 15 most recently used static regular expression patterns are cached.
