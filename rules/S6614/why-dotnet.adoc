== Why is this an issue?

Generating a new Regex instance for every use can result in costly compilation of complex patterns or large strings, leading to slower execution times and higher memory usage.

Utilizing a single Regex instance can optimize performance and decrease memory usage by avoiding the overhead of compiling the regular expression pattern repeatedly.
