``++GO TO++`` should not be used to transfer control outside the current module, because any implied ``++EXIT++`` points will then be ignored. A module is either a section, a paragraph, or a set of paragraphs called with the ``++PERFORM ... THRU ...++`` statement.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
         PERFORM PARAGRAPH1 THRU PARAGRAPH3.     > code contained between PARAGRAPH1 and PARAGRAPH3 is now considered as a module
         EXIT PROGRAM.

        PARAGRAPH1.
         MOVE A TO B.
         IF SOMETHING
           GO TO PARAGRAPH3     >OK
         END-IF.
         IF SOMETHING-ELSE 
           GO TO PARAGRAPH4     >NOK as we leave the module called with "PERFORM PARGRAPH1 THRU PARAGRAPH3" statement
         END-IF.

        PARAGRAPH2.
         MOVE A TO B.

        PARAGRAPH3.
         EXIT.

        PARAGRAPH4.
