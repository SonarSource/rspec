When S3 buckets versioning is enabled it's possible to add an additional authentication factor before being allowed to delete versions of an object or changing the versioning state of a bucket. It prevents accidental object deletion by forcing the user sending the delete request to prove that he has a valid MFA device and a corresponding valid token.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The S3 bucket stores sensitive information that is required to be preserved on the long term.
* The S3 bucket grants delete permission to many users.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to enable S3 MFA delete, note that:

* MFA delete can only be enabled with the AWS CLI or API and with the root account.
* To delete an object version, the API should be used with the ``++x-amz-mfa++`` header.
* The API request, with the ``++x-amz-mfa++`` header, can only be used in HTTPS.


== Sensitive Code Example

A versioned S3 bucket doesn't have MFA delete enabled:

----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mynoncompliantbucket" { # Sensitive
  bucket = "mynoncompliantbucketname"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

MFA delete is enabled (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/629[it's not possible to set this option] to a new S3 bucket with Terraform but the Terraform template can be updated that way it reflects the state):

----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mycompliantbucket" { # Compliant 
  bucket = "mycompliantbucketname"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
    mfa_delete = true
  }
}
----
