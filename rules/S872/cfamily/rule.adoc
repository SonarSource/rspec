== Why is this an issue?

The use of ``++bool++`` operands with other operators is unlikely to be meaningful (or intended). Best case it will be confusing to maintainers, worst case it will not have the intended effect. Either way, it is highly recommended to stick to boolean operators when dealing with ``++bool++`` operands.

This rule allows the detection of such uses, which often occur because the logical operators (``++&&++``, ``++||++`` and ``++!++``) can be easily confused with the bitwise operators (``++&++``, ``++|++`` and ``++~++``).


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
bool b1 = true;
bool b2 = false;
int8_t s8a;
if ( b1 & b2 ) // Noncompliant
if ( ~b1 ) // Noncompliant
if ( b1 < b2 ) // Noncompliant
if ( b1 ^ b2 ) // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
if ( b1 && b2 )
if ( !b1 )
if ( b1 == false )
if ( b1 == b2 )
if ( b1 != b2 )
s8a = b1 ? 3 : 7;
----


=== Exceptions

Operators ``++|=++`` and ``++&=++`` are ignored when used with ``++bool++`` operands. Operator ``{plus}{plus}`` is also ignored with a ``++bool++`` operand because it is covered by rule S2668.

[source,cpp]
----
void test(bool b1, bool b2, int i1) {
  b1 |= b2; // ignored
  b1++; // ignored here, handled by S2668
  b1 &= b2; // ignored
  b1 &= i1; // Noncompliant; right operand is not a bool
}
----

* I've changed this to reliability & added a 'bug' tag since the description says the usage is likely an error (bug tag) & therefore the code doesn't do what you thought it did (reliability).
* There's no need to explicitly mark code as compliant in the Compliant Solution. By definition, there should be no noncompliant code in there. :-)

I would say they're two sides of the same coin [~evgeny.mandrikov] - a complimentary, opposing pair: "don't use bools with anything but && (&etc.)" versus "don't use non-bools with && (&etc.)"


If we allowed the restating and combination of MISRA rules, then these might be covered together in a single implementation... ;)

It's not currently clear whether this rule is primarily about bugs or code smells. CPP-1816 has been entered to remove some of the current noise. It's possible other passes will be needed.
