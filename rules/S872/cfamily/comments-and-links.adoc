* I've changed this to reliability & added a 'bug' tag since the description says the usage is likely an error (bug tag) & therefore the code doesn't do what you thought it did (reliability).

It's not currently clear whether this rule is primarily about bugs or code smells. CPP-1816 has been entered to remove some of the current noise. It's possible other passes will be needed.
