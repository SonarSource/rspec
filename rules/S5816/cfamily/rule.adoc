In C, a string is just a buffer of characters, normally using the ``++null++`` character as a sentinel for the end of the string. This means that the developer has to be aware of low-level details such as buffer sizes or having an extra character to store the final ``++null++`` character. Doing that correctly and consistently is notoriously difficult and any error can lead to a security vulnerability, for instance, giving access to sensitive data or allowing arbitrary code execution.


The function ``++char *strncpy(char * restrict dest, const char * restrict src, size_t count);++`` copies the first ``++count++`` characters from ``++src++`` to ``++dest++``, stopping at the first ``++null++`` character, and filling extra space with 0. The ``++wcsncpy++`` does the same for wide characters and should be used with the same guidelines.


Both of those functions are designed to work with fixed-length strings and might result in a non-``++null++``-terminated string.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* There is a possibility that either the ``++source++`` or the ``++destination++`` pointer is ``++null++``
* The security of your system can be compromised if the ``++destination++`` is a truncated version of the ``++source++``
* The ``++source++`` buffer can be both non-``++null++``-terminated and smaller than the ``++count++``
* The ``++destination++`` buffer can be smaller than the ``++count++``
* You expect ``++dest++`` to be a ``++null++``-terminated string
* There is an overlap between the ``++source++`` and the ``++destination++``

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* C11 provides, in its annex K, the ``++strncpy_s++`` and the ``++wcsncpy_s++`` that were designed as safer alternatives to ``++strcpy++`` and ``++wcscpy++``. It's not recommended to use them in all circumstances, because they introduce a runtime overhead and require to write more code for error handling, but they perform checks that will limit the consequences of calling the function with bad arguments.
* Even if your compiler does not exactly support annex K, you probably have access to similar functions
* If you are using ``++strncpy++`` and ``++wsncpy++`` as a safer version of ``++strcpy++`` and ``++wcscpy++``, you should instead consider ``++strcpy_s++`` and ``++wcscpy_s++``, because these functions have several shortcomings:
** It's not easy to detect truncation
** Too much work is done to fill the buffer with 0, leading to suboptimal performance
** Unless manually corrected, the ``++dest++`` string might not be ``++null++``-terminated
* If you want to use ``++strcpy++`` and ``++wcscpy++`` functions and detect if the string was truncated, the pattern is the following:
** Set the last character of the buffer to ``++null++``
** Call the function
** Check if the last character of the buffer is still ``++null++``
* If you are writing {cpp} code, using ``++std::string++`` to manipulate strings is much simpler and less error-prone


== Sensitive Code Example

----
int f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest)); // Sensitive: might silently truncate
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
int f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  dest[sizeof dest - 1] = 0;
  strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest)); // Compliant
  if (dest[sizeof dest - 1] != 0) {
    // Handle error
  }
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
