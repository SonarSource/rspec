While C syntax considers array subscripts (`+[]+`) as symmetrical, meaning that `+a[i]+` and `+i[a]+` are equivalent, the convention is to put the index in the brackets rather than the array name. Inverting the index and array name serves no purpose, and is very confusing.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
10[P1] = 0; // Noncompliant
dostuff(i[arr]); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
P1[10] = 0;
dostuff(arr[i]);
----
