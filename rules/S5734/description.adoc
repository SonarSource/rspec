https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/08/26/mitigating-mime-confusion-attacks-in-firefox/[MIME confusion] attacks occur when an attacker successfully tricks a web-browser to interpret a resource as a different type than the one expected. To correctly interpret a resource (script, image, stylesheet ...) web browsers look for the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type[Content-Type header] defined in the HTTP response received from the server, but often this header is not set or is set with an incorrect value. To avoid content-type mismatch and to provide the best user experience, web browsers try to deduce the right content-type, generally by inspecting the content of the resources (the first bytes). This "guess mechanism" is called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_sniffing[MIME type sniffing].

Attackers can take advantage of this feature when a website ("example.com" here) allows to upload arbitrary files. In that case, an attacker can upload a malicious image _fakeimage.png_ (containing malicious JavaScript code or https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/archive/blogs/ieinternals/script-polyglots[a polyglot content] file) such as:

----
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
----

When the victim will visit the website showing the uploaded image, the malicious script embedded into the image will be executed by web browsers performing MIME type sniffing.
