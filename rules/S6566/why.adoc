== Why is this an issue?

You should use `DateTimeOffset` instead of `DateTime` as it provides all the information that the `DateTime` struct has, and additionally, the offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
This way you can avoid potential problems created by the lack of timezone awareness (see the "Pitfalls" section below for more information).

However, it's important to note that although `DateTimeOffset` contains more information than `DateTime` by storing the offset to UTC, it isn't tied to a specific time zone. This information must be stored separately to have a full picture of the moment in time with the use of `TimeZoneInfo`.
