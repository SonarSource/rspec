== How to fix it
In most cases, you can directly replace `DateTime` with `DateTimeOffset`.
When hardcoding dates with local kind keep in mind that the offset is timezone dependent so it should be set according to which timezone that data is representing.
For more information refer to DateTime and DateTimeOffset documentation from Microsoft (see "Resources" section below).
