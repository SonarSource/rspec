=== Pitfalls
Common `DateTime` pitfalls include:
- Working with `DateTime` of kind `Local` consider the time offset of the machine where the program is running. Not storing this information separately can result in meaningless data when retrieved from a different location.  
- When working with `DateTime` of kind `Unknown`, calling `ToUniversalTime()` presumes the `DateTime.Kind` is local and converts to UTC. When calling `ToLocalTime()`, it presumes the `DateTime.Kind` is universal and converts that to local. If you call `ToUniversalTime()`, it converts X hours in one direction, but if you call `ToLocalTime()` on it, it converts X hours in the opposite direction. Neither of these conversions can be considered correct.
- Once a comparison is done between two `DateTimes`, the user needs to ensure they are within the same time zone. `DateTime` doesnâ€™t consider UTC/Local when doing comparisons; it only cares about the number of `Ticks` on the objects.
- Using it with dates that are not timestamps, for example New Year (this happens on Jan 1st at exactly 0:00, but it's not a timestamp because it occurs every year at different moments in each parts of the world), or birthdays, in which case .NET 6 introduced new structs called DateOnly and TimeOnly.
