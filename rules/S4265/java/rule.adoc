Both ``++FixedSizeList++`` from the Commons library, and the list returned from ``++Arrays.asList++`` offer ``++add++`` and ``++remove++`` methods (as required by the ``++List++`` interface they implement), but neither truly supports their use. Both list types have fixed lengths and will throw errors if an ``++add++`` or ``++remove++`` method, or any of their variations, is called.


This rule raises an issue when one of the following methods is invoked on a ``++FixedSizeList++`` instance:

* ``++add++``
* ``++addAll++``
* ``++clear++``
* ``++remove++``
* ``++removeAll++``


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("Hello");
strings.add("world");  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("Hello", "world");
----
