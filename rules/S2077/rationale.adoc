Formatted SQL queries refer to a coding practice where SQL queries are
constructed by concatenating strings together at runtime. This approach is often
used to include variable parts in a SQL query, such as user inputs or other
data-driven elements. The final form of the query is determined based on the
program's execution context and the specific values of the variables at that
moment. This method provides flexibility in creating customized queries based on
specific conditions or user inputs. However, it is important to note that this
practice can potentially introduce significant risks and challenges if not
handled properly and thus its use is discouraged.
