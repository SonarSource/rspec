*Implementation details*:

Note that the first parameter of many function has a ``++string++`` as first parameter. The reason is that we do not want to highlight the instantiation of empty objects such as ``++new OdbcCommand()++`` which have their command set later via their property ``++CommandText++``. The goal is to highlight the exact moment where the SQL string query is provided to the command. That way we highlight the place where the injection can take place.


Note also that no issue should be created if the SQL command has no risk of injection. Thus if the SQL command is a hard-coded string or the concatenation of hard-coded strings, it should not create an issue.

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] [~pierre-loup.tristant] - should this rule be harmonized with the libraries we support for RSPEC-3649 (e.g. Dapper, Petapoco, NHibernate)?
