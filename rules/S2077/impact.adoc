=== What is the potential impact?

Dynamically concatenated SQL query strings can lead to several serious issues,
particularly related to security, performance, and maintainability.

==== SQL Injection

The most significant risk associated with dynamically concatenated SQL queries
is SQL Injection. This is a type of security vulnerability that allows an
attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its
database. When the application does not properly validate or sanitize user
inputs before adding them to the SQL query, an attacker can insert malicious
SQL code.

This can lead to a variety of harmful outcomes:

 * Unauthorized Data Access: An attacker could use injected SQL code to retrieve
   sensitive information from the database, such as personal user data or
   confidential business information. This could lead to serious privacy
   breaches and potential legal issues.
 * Data Manipulation or Deletion: If an attacker successfully injects SQL code
   that alters or deletes data, it can corrupt the database and lead to
   inaccurate or misleading information being stored. This can have serious
   implications for any decisions or actions based on that data.

==== Performance Issues

Dynamically concatenated SQL queries can also lead to performance issues. Since
these queries are constructed at runtime, they cannot be pre-compiled or
optimized by the database management system in the same way as static queries
or parameterized queries. This can result in slower execution times,
particularly for complex queries or large databases, which can negatively impact
the overall performance of the application.

==== Maintainability

From a code quality perspective, dynamically concatenated SQL queries can make
the code harder to read and maintain. The final form of the query is not
immediately clear from the code itself, which can lead to confusion and
mistakes. This can increase the likelihood of bugs and make them harder to track
down and fix.
