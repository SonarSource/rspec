\[~ann.campbell.2] there is a huge difference between the two rules :

* In PL/SQL, when using Literals or Substitution Variables there is absolutely no risk to change the structure of the SQL request to do something which is not expected -> so we absolutely don't care about the content of literal or substitution variables and a so about the fact that those values should be sanitized. The only overlap between the two rules is the remediation action but the purpose is absolutely not the same
