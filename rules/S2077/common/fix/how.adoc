Instead of building a SQL query by concatenating strings, it is best to use
prepared statements. Prepared statements offer a more secure and efficient way
to execute SQL commands. They work by pre-compiling the SQL statement, which can
then be executed multiple times with different parameters. This separation of
data from the command ensures that malicious code cannot be injected into the
query, thereby preventing SQL injection attacks. Additionally, since the
database only needs to parse, compile, and optimize the SQL statement once,
prepared statements can lead to significant performance improvements,
particularly when executing complex queries or running the same query multiple
times with different parameters.
