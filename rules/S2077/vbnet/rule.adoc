    command = New SqlCommand(sensitiveQuery) ' Sensitive

    command.CommandText = sensitiveQuery ' Sensitive

    Dim adapter As SqlDataAdapter
    adapter = New SqlDataAdapter(sensitiveQuery, connection) ' Sensitive
End Sub

Public Sub Foo(ByVal context As DbContext, ByVal query As String, ByVal param As String)
    Dim sensitiveQuery As String = String.Concat(query, param)
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(sensitiveQuery) ' Sensitive

    context.Query(Of User)().FromSql(sensitiveQuery) ' Sensitive
