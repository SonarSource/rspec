Formatted SQL queries can be difficult to maintain, debug and can increase the risk of SQL injection when concatenating untrusted values into the query. However, this rule doesn't detect SQL injections, the goal is only to highlight complex/formatted queries.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
Public Sub SqlCommands(ByVal connection As SqlConnection, ByVal query As String, ByVal param As String)
    Dim sensitiveQuery As String = String.Concat(query, param)
    command = New SqlCommand(sensitiveQuery) ' Sensitive

    command.CommandText = sensitiveQuery ' Sensitive

    Dim adapter As SqlDataAdapter
    adapter = New SqlDataAdapter(sensitiveQuery, connection) ' Sensitive
End Sub

Public Sub Foo(ByVal context As DbContext, ByVal query As String, ByVal param As String)
    Dim sensitiveQuery As String = String.Concat(query, param)
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(sensitiveQuery) ' Sensitive

    context.Query(Of User)().FromSql(sensitiveQuery) ' Sensitive
End Sub
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Public Sub Foo(ByVal context As DbContext, ByVal value As String)
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE mycol=@p0", value) ' Compliant, the query is parameterized
End Sub
