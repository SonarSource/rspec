Formatting strings used as SQL queries is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9019[CVE-2018-9019]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7318[CVE-2018-7318]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5611[CVE-2017-5611]

SQL queries often need to use a hardcoded SQL string with a dynamic parameter coming from a user request. Formatting a string to add those parameters to the request is a bad practice as it can result in an https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection[SQL injection]. The safe way to add parameters to a SQL query is to use SQL binding mechanisms.


This rule flags the execution of SQL queries which are built using formatting of strings, even if there is no injection. This rule does not detect SQL injections. The goal is to guide security code reviews and to prevent a common bad practice.


The following functions are detected as SQL query execution:

* ``++mysql_query++``
* ``++mysql_db_query++``
* ``++mysql_unbuffered_query++``
* ``++pg_query++``
* ``++pg_send_query++``
* ``++mssql_query++``
* ``++mysqli_query++`` and ``++mysqli::query++``
* ``++mysqli_real_query++`` and ``++mysqli::real_query++``
* ``++mysqli_multi_query++`` and ``++mysqli::multi_query++``
* ``++mysqli_send_query++`` and ``++mysqli::send_query++``
* ``++PDO::query++``
* ``++PDO::exec++``
* ``++PDO::prepare++``

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Avoid building queries manually using formatting technics. If you do it anyway, do not include user input in this building process.
* Use https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet[parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures] whenever possible.
* PHP Data Objects (PDO) prepared statement with bound parameters should be preferred to native database functions.
* Avoid executing SQL queries containing unsafe input in stored procedures or functions.
* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet[Sanitize] every unsafe input.

You can also reduce the impact of an attack by using a database account with low privileges.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
$id = $_GET['id'];
mysql_connect('localhost', $username, $password) or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
mysql_select_db('myDatabase') or die('Could not select database');

$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE id = " . $id);  // Sensitive, could be susceptible to SQL injection

while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)) {
    echo $row->name;
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
$id = $_GET['id'];
try {
    $conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=myDatabase', $username, $password);
    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);    

    $stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE id = :id');
    $stmt->execute(array('id' => $id));

    while($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_OBJ)) {
        echo $row->name;
    }
} catch(PDOException $e) {
    echo 'ERROR: ' . $e->getMessage();
}
----

== Exceptions

No issue will be raised if one of the functions is called with hard-coded string (no concatenation) and this string does not contain a "$" sign.

----
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE id = 42") or die('Query failed: ' . mysql_error());  // Compliant
----

The current implementation does not follow variables. It will only detect SQL queries which are concatenated or contain a ``++$++`` sign directly in the function call.

----
$query = "SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE id = " . $id;
$result = mysql_query($query);  // No issue will be raised even if it is Sensitive
----
