Updating the value of a column that is part of a partitioning index could force the database to move a row from one partition to another. The move operation itself might be costly, but even worse without regularly updating the DB statistics, many updates like this might impact the performance of subsequent SQL requests that use the partitioning index.


*Note* This rule raises issues only when a database catalog is provided during the SonarQube analysis.
