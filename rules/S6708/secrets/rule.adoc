=== What is the potential impact?

In the case of Discord, a webhook URL allows access to a channel and the
consequences depend on what is specified in the `Bot Permissions`.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Identity spoofing

Using the webhook URL, attackers can impersonate you or your bot, send messages
on your behalf or perform other actions that could disrupt the integrity of
your server.

==== Phishing

An attacker can use this webhook to offer users links to a malicious
domain controlled by the attacker. From here, an attacker can intercept the
user’s credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), and take over the
user’s account on the trusted site.

==== Malware distribution

In addition, malware can be stored and distributed, both to Discord users and
other potential targets, as Discord is often used for storage. +
It is important to note that this leak can lead
to full system compromises in the worst-case scenario.
