=== What is the potential impact?

The Discord Webhook URL contains secrets and should be treated as a confidential key that can be used to access Discord channels and, by extension, user data.
Should this secret fall into the wrong hands, two immediate concerns arise:
* Unauthorized Access: If the webhook URL falls into the wrong hands, malicious actors can gain unauthorized access to your Discord server. They can potentially impersonate you or your bot, send messages on your behalf, or perform other actions that may disrupt your server's integrity.
* Malicious Content: Attackers may use the leaked webhook URL to send malicious content, such as phishing links, malware, or viruses, to your server members. This can compromise their security and privacy, leading to potential data breaches or other harmful consequences.
