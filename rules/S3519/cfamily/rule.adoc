Array overruns and buffer overflows happen when memory access accidentally goes beyond the boundary of the allocated array or buffer. These overreaching accesses cause some of the most damaging, and hard to track defects.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int array[10];
array[10] = 0; // Noncompliant: index should be between 0 & 9

char *buffer1 = (char *) malloc(100);
char *buffer2 = (char *) malloc(50);
memcpy(buffer2, buffer1, 100); // Noncompliant: buffer2 will overflow.
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int array[10];
array[9] = 0;

char *buffer1 = (char *) malloc(100);
char *buffer2 = (char *) malloc(50);
memcpy(buffer2, buffer1, 50);
----
