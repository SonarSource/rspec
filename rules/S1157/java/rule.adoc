== Why is this an issue?

Using `toLowerCase()` or `toUpperCase()` to make case insensitive comparisons is inefficient because it requires the creation of temporary, intermediate `String` objects.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
private void compareStrings(String foo, String bar){
    boolean result1 = foo.toUpperCase().equals(bar);               // Noncompliant
    boolean result2 = foo.equals(bar.toUpperCase());               // Noncompliant
    boolean result3 = foo.toLowerCase().equals(bar.toLowerCase()); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
private void compareStrings(String foo, String bar){
    boolean result = foo.equalsIgnoreCase(bar);                    // Compliant
}
----


=== Exceptions

No issue will be raised when a locale is specified because the result could be different from `equalsIgnoreCase()`. (e.g.: using the Turkish locale)

[source,java]
----
private void compareStrings(String foo, String bar, java.util.Locale locale){
    boolean result1 = foo.toUpperCase(locale).equals(bar);         // Compliant
}
----

Dinesh went a lot of rounds on this one. It'll probably kill him that I still made a change.

Not at all Ann ;-) I didn't yet commit the implementation, so your change did not take any additional effort to apply! Thanks!
