== Why is this an issue?

cf attached code snippet.


The reason for making a member private or protected is to limit access to it. So it doesn’t make a lot of sense to write functions that give the ability to freely access restricted members.

This rule doesn’t apply for singleton design pattern.

Note : Rule checker tool ({cpp}Test) generates violations also for singleton design patterns.
