\[~tamas.vajk] I noticed you overrode the SQALE remediation cost. Is this truly a language-specific difference, or do you think it's wrong in the main task?

\[~ann.campbell.2] In Java you can write call a utility method through an instance, like ``++(new StringUtils()).Concatenate("a", "b")++``, so if you change the visibility of the constructor, then you'll need to change all these calls to ``++StringUtils.Concatenate(...)++``. However, in C# you can't use a static method through an instance, so changing the visibility of the constructor won't affect the code as much as in Java.


But thinking about it a bit, the 2 minutes is a bit too short, I'll modify it to 10mn, because you might have useless ``++new StringUtils()++`` calls in the code.
