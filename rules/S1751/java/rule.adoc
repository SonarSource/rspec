== Why is this an issue?

A `loop` statement with at most one iteration is equivalent to an `If` statement; the following block is executed only once.

If the initial intention was to conditionally execute the block only once, an `If` statement should be used instead.
If that was not the initial intention, the loop block should be fixed so the block is executed multiple times.

A loop statement with at most one iteration can happen when a statement unconditionally transfers control, such as a jump or throw statement, is misplaced inside the loop block.

This rule arises when the following statements are misplaced:

* `break`
* `return`
* `throw`

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Noncompliant; loop only executes once
  printf("i is %d", i);
  break;
}
----

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Noncompliant; loop only executes once
  if (i == x) {
    break;
  } else {
    printf("i is %d", i);
    return;
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("i is %d", i);
}
----

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == x) {
    break;
  } else {
    printf("i is %d", i);
  }
}
----
