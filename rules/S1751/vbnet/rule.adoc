== Why is this an issue?

A https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/control-flow/loop-structures[loop] statement with at most one iteration is equivalent to an `If` statement; the following block is executed only once.

If the initial intention was to conditionally execute the block only once, an `If` statement should be used instead. If that was not the initial intention, the block of the loop should be fixed so the block is executed multiple times.

A loop statement with at most one iteration can happen when a statement unconditionally transfers control, such as a jump statement or a throw statement, is misplaced inside the loop block.

This rule raises when the following statements are misplaced:

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/continue-statement[`Continue`]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement[`Return`]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/throw-statement[`Throw`]

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Function Method(items As IEnumerable(Of Object)) As Object
    For i As Integer = 0 To 9
        Console.WriteLine(i)
        Exit For ' Noncompliant: loop only executes once
    Next

    For Each item As Object In items
        Return item ' Noncompliant: loop only executes once
    Next
    Return Nothing
End Function
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Function Method(items As IEnumerable(Of Object)) As Object
    For i As Integer = 0 To 9
        Console.WriteLine(i)
    Next

    Dim item = items.FirstOrDefault()
    If item IsNot Nothing Then
        Return item
    End If
    Return Nothing
End Function
----
