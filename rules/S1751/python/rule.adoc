== Why is this an issue?

A loop with at most one iteration is equivalent to the use of an ``++if++`` statement to conditionally execute one piece of code. No developer expects to find such a use of a loop statement. If the initial intention of the author was really to conditionally execute one piece of code, an ``++if++`` statement should be used instead.


At worst that was not the initial intention of the author and so the body of the loop should be fixed to use the nested ``++return++``, ``++break++`` or ``++raise++`` statements in a more appropriate way.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
while node is not None:
  node = node.parent()
  print(node)
  break
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
while node is not None:
  node = node.parent()
  print(node)
