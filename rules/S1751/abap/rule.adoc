== Why is this an issue?

A loop with at most one iteration is equivalent to the use of an ``++IF++`` statement to conditionally execute one piece of code. No developer expects to find such usage of a loop statement. If the initial intention of the author was really to conditionally execute one piece of code, an ``++IF++`` statement should be used in place. 

At worst that was not the initial intention of the author and so the body of the loop should be fixed to use the nested ``++STOP++``, ``++RETURN++`` or ``++EXIT++`` statements in a more appropriate way.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
DATA remainder TYPE i. 
DO 20 TIMES. 
  remainder = sy-index MOD 2. 
  cl_demo_output=>write_text(). 
  EXIT.  " noncompliant, loop only executes once
ENDDO. 
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,abap]
----
DATA remainder TYPE i. 
DO 20 TIMES. 
  remainder = sy-index MOD 2. 
  cl_demo_output=>write_text(). 
ENDDO.
