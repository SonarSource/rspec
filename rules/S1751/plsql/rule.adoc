== Why is this an issue?

A loop with at most one iteration is equivalent to the use of an ``++IF++`` statement to conditionally execute one piece of code. No developer expects to find such usage of a loop statement. If the initial intention of the author was really to conditionally execute one piece of code, an ``++IF++`` statement should be used in place. 

At worst that was not the initial intention of the author and so the body of the loop should be fixed to use the nested ``++RETURN++``, ``++EXIT++``, ``++RAISE++`` or ``++GOTO++`` statements in a more appropriate way.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
LOOP
  counter := counter + 1;
  dbms_output.put_line(counter);
  EXIT;   -- Noncompliant
END LOOP;
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
LOOP
  counter := counter + 1;
  IF counter > 10 THEN
    EXIT;
  ELSE 
    dbms_output.put_line(counter);
  END IF;
END LOOP;
