== Why is this an issue?

A loop with at most one iteration is equivalent to the use of an ``++if++`` statement to conditionally execute one piece of code. If the initial intention of the author was really to conditionally execute one piece of code, an ``++if++`` statement should be used instead. If that was not the initial intention of the author, the body of the loop should be fixed to use the nested ``++return++``, ``++break++`` or ``++throw++`` statements in a more appropriate way.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    break;  // Noncompliant, loop only executes once
}
...
foreach (var item in items)
{
    return item;  // Noncompliant, loop only executes once
}
...
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
...
var item = items.FirstOrDefault();
if (item != null)
{
    return item;
}
...
