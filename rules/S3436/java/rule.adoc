== Why is this an issue?

According to the documentation,

____
A program may produce unpredictable results if it attempts to distinguish two references to equal values of a value-based class, whether directly via reference equality or indirectly via an appeal to synchronization...
____


This is because value-based classes are intended to be wrappers for value types, which will be primitive-like collections of data (similar to ``++struct++``s in other languages) that will come in future versions of Java.


____
Instances of a value-based class ... 

* do not have accessible constructors, but are instead instantiated through factory methods which make no commitment as to the identity of returned instances;
____

This means that you can't be sure you're the only one trying to lock on any given instance of a value-based class, opening your code up to contention and deadlock issues.


Under Java 8 breaking this rule may not actually break your code, but there are no guarantees of the behavior beyond that.


This rule raises an issue when a known value-based class is used for synchronization. That includes all the classes in the ``++java.time++`` package except ``++Clock++``; the date classes for alternate calendars, ``++HijrahDate++``, ``++JapaneseDate++``, ``++MinguoDate++``, ``++ThaiBuddhistDate++``; and the optional classes: ``++Optional++``, ``++OptionalDouble++``, ``++OptionalLong++``, ``++OptionalInt++``.


*Note* that this rule is automatically disabled when the project's ``++sonar.java.source++`` is lower than ``++8++``.

=== Message

Synchronize on a non-value-based object; synchronizing on a "xxx" could lead to contention.
