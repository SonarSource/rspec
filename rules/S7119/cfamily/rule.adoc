This rule raises an issue if initializer of the variable with static storage duration (global or static),
refers to variable that may not yet be initialized. 

== Why is this an issue?

{cpp} allows variables with static storage duration, 
such as global or static variables inside of class of funciton,
to have arbitrally complex initializers.

Such variables are zero-initialized at the start of the program,
and further initialization is performed at runtime,
in the process reffered as dynamic initialization.

The dynamic such variables is performed in the order of they defintions in the source file.
However, the order of initialization of variables defined in different source files is not specified.
In case when the global variable refers to variable defined in different source file,
the behavior of the program is not guaranteed:

[source,cpp]
----
extern int global1;
// Defined in different source file as:
// int global1 = 20;

int const global2 = global1 + 10; // Noncomplaint 
----

Depending on the ordering of the initialization of `global1` and `global2` variables,
the `global2` may be set to:

* `30` if `global1` is initialized before `global2`
* `10` if `global2` is initialized before `global1`, as `global1` will have value `0`.

This rule raises issue if the initializer of the global or static variable,
directly refers to the other global variable, that may not yet be initialized.
In other words, refering to a variable is not required to be initialized before given variable.

This is subset of issues related to initialization of global variables,
commonly reffered as static initialization order fiasco.

=== What is the potential impact?

The bahavior of any program that is prone to static initialization order fiasco issue,
is very fragile. 
The order of initialization may change with modification of source files, 
that does not contain impacted variable, or even differ between the builds of same source.
As such any such issues are hard to reproduce and debug.

Furthermore, the impact of this issues are vast and varied.
It is not only limited to observing different values of variables betwen builds,
as presented in example of `global1` and `global2`.

For the class types, invoking any member functions of object that was zero-initialized,
but for which constructor was not run, may cause undefined behavior and crash the program:

[source,cpp]
----
extern std::string const string1;
std::string const string2 = string1; // Noncompliant: undefined behavior
----

And even, in case when particular implementation supports using zero-initialized object,
the program may still encounter undefined-behavior even:

[source,cpp]
----
extern std::vector<std::string> const list;
// Defined in different source file as:
// std::vector<std::string> const list{"entry1", "entry2"};

std::string const firstElem = list[0]; // Noncompliant: undefined behavior
----

=== Static variable in template classes and variable templates are also impacted

TODO

== How to fix it

This section present few general approaches to resolving issues related to order of initialization,
covering various scenarios and uses of the code.

=== Define depedendent variable in one source file.

 

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
FIXME

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
FIXME
----


* defining in samne file
* making in constant
* static variable in function
* inline variable

* pitfall: const implies static - may need inline
