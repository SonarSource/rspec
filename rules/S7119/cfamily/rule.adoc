This rule raises an issue if the initializer of a global variable `a`,
refers to another global variable `b`, when there is no guarantee that `b` is initialized before `a`.

== Why is this an issue?

{cpp} allows global variables to have arbitrally complex initializers.

Such variables are zero-initialized statically,
and further initialization is performed at runtime,
in the process referred to as dynamic initialization.

Within a single source file, the dynamic initialization of such variables is performed in the order of their definitions.
However, the order of initialization of variables defined in different source files is not specified.
Therefore, when a global variable refers to a variable defined in a different source file,
the behavior of the program is not guaranteed:

[source,cpp]
----
extern int global1;
// Defined in different source file as:
// int global1 = 20;

int const global2 = global1 + 10; // Noncompliant
----

Depending on the order of initialization of `global1` and `global2`, `global2` may be set to:

* `30` if `global1` is initialized before `global2`
* `10` if `global2` is initialized before `global1`, as `global1` will only be zero-initialized to `0`.

This rule raises an issue if the initializer of a global variable `a`,
directly refers to another global variable `b`, when there is no guarantee that `b` is initialized before `a`.

This is a subset of the issues related to initialization of global variables,
commonly referred to as a static initialization order fiasco.

=== What is the potential impact?

The behavior of any program that is prone to static initialization order fiasco issues,
is very fragile.
The order of initialization may change at any time, for instance, when performing unrelated changes to the source code, or even differ between the builds of the same source.
Such issues are very hard to reproduce and debug.

Furthermore, the impact is not only limited to observing fluctuating values of global variables, as presented in the previous example.

For class types, invoking any member functions of an object that is only zero-initialized and 
for which the constructor has not run, may cause undefined behavior and crash the program:

[source,cpp]
----
extern std::string const string1;
std::string const string2 = string1; // Noncompliant: undefined behavior
----

Even if, for a particular implementation, zero-initialized objects are equivalent to default-initialized objects,
the program may still encounter undefined behavior:

[source,cpp]
----
extern std::vector<std::string> const list;
// Defined in different source file as:
// std::vector<std::string> const list{"entry1", "entry2"};

std::string const firstElem = list[0]; // Noncompliant: undefined behavior
----

=== Static class data members also use dynamic initialization

Static data members of classes are dynamically initialized if their initializers are not constant expressions.
Therefore, this rule will consider static data members of classes as if they were global variables.

[source,cpp]
----
// Clazz.hpp
extern int global;
class Clazz {
  static int staticMem;
};

// Clazz.cpp
#include "Clazz.hpp"

int Clazz::staticMem = global + 10; // Noncompliant: `global` may not yet be fully initialized

// Source.cpp
#include "Clazz.hpp"

int global = 10;
int otherGlobal = Clazz::staticMem; // Noncompliant: `Clazz::staticMem` may not yet be fully initalized
----

=== Initialization of instantiated variable is unordered

If a globali variable instantiated from the template requires a dynamic initialization (because initialization is non-constant),
there is no guarantee for the ordering of such initialization.
It may be performed before the initializer of the global variable that was declared before it.
As a consequence, such variables should not refer to any global variable in their initializers, 
or be referred from the initializer of any variable with dynamic initialization.

An instantiated variable may be produced direclty from instantiation of variable template (introduced {cpp}14),
when such template is used with template arguments.

[source,cpp]
----
int global1 = runtimeFunc();

template<typename T>
T varTempl = global1; // Noncompliant: `global1` may be initializer later

int global2 = varTempl<long>; // Noncompliant: `varTempl` may be initializer later
----

Similarly, static data member of class template instantiation behave as instantiated global variables,
they initialization are unordered.

[source,cpp]
----
int global1 = runtimeFunc();

template<typename T>
struct Clazz {
  static T staticMem;
};

template<typename T>
T Clazz<T>::staticMem = global1; // Noncompliant: `global1` may be initializer later

int global2 = Clazz<long>::staticMem; // Noncompliant: `Clazz<long>::staticMem` may be initializer later
----


== How to fix it

This section presents few general approaches to resolving issues related to the order of initialization,
covering various scenarios and uses of the code.

An important consideration is that if you are having trouble with the initialization order fiasco,
this may be a sign that you are using too much global state in your code.

=== Define related variables in a single source file.

As the order of initialization is defined by the standard for variables defined in the same file,
defining all dependent variables in a single source file addressed the issue.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// header.h
extern std::string s1;
extern std::string s2;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s1 = "Some string";

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s2 = s1 + " in other file"; // Noncompliant: `s1` may be initialized after `s2`
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// header.h
extern std::string s1;
extern std::string s2;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s1 = "Some string";
std::string s2 = s1 + " in other file"; // Complaint: `s1` is initialized before `s2`

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
----

=== Force constant initialization of referred variable.

Order of initialization issues are limited to variables that are initialized at runtime (via dynamic initialization),
and do not affect variables that are initialized at compile time, via constant initialization.

A variable, even dynamically initialized, can safely use in its initializer data available at compile-time: literals or variables with constant initialization.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// header.h
extern int const count;
extern std::vector<int> entries;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"
int const count = 20;

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::vector<int> entries(count); // Noncompliant: `count` may not initialized before `entries`
----

==== Compliant solution

If the project uses {cpp}11 or later standard, you may define the variable as `constexpr` to force constant initialization.
In case when the initialization cannot be performed at compile time, the program will be ill-formed.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
// header.h
constexpr int count = 20;
extern std::vector<int> entries;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::vector<int> entries(count); // Compliant: `count` is initialized at compile time to 20
----

If the project is limited to {cpp}98/{cpp}03, constant initialization is only supported for variables of integral types
that are defined as `const` and only use literals or other constants in their initializers.

[source,cpp]
----
// header.h
int const count = 20;
extern std::vector<int> entries;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::vector<int> entries(count); // Compliant: `count` is initialized at compile time to 20
----

==== Handling class static data members

If a static data member is constant, its value may be defined in its class:
[source,cpp]
----
struct Clazz {
  static int const constMem = 10;
  static constexpr int constexprMem = 10;
};
----

However, in the case of `const` members and `constexpr` static data members before {cpp}17,
the definition of the variable needs to be provided when its address is taken or a reference to it is created.

Such a definition should not repeat the initializer, and can be placed in a source file (not in the header):
[source,cpp]
----
int const Clazz::constMem;
// separate `Clazz::constexprMem` definition is only required before C++17
int const Clazz::constexprMem; //  const is implied by `constexpr`
----

Or when using {cpp}17 or later in the header file with `inline` keyword.
[source,cpp]
----
inline int const Clazz::constMem;
// separate `Clazz::constexprMem` definition is not required in C++17 or later
----

==== Using `inline` to avoid multiple definitions.

In {cpp} variables declares as `const`, which also covers `constexpr`, has internal linkage.
This means that they are not visible outside of the translation unit.
As a consequence, multiple files can define constants with the same name, and each such file will contain an independent occurrence of the variable.

This also applies when the `const` variable is defined in a header file which is included from multiple files.
In the following example, each `source1.cpp` and `source2.cpp` file contains independent copies of variable `count`.

[source,cpp]
----
// header.h
constexpr int count = 20;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"

void print1() {
  std::cout << &count << std::endl;
}

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"

void print2() {
  std::cout << &count << std::endl;
}
----

As each of copy of `count` is constant initialized, issues related to order of initialization are addressed.
However, the address of such a variable is different when observed from different files  (i.e., `print1` and `print2` will produce different outputs),
and this solution may not be viable if the original code depends on `count` being unique.

This limitation may be addressed when using {cpp}17 or later, by marking by marking such variable as `inline`.

=== Replace global variable with static function variable

A static variable defined in the function body is initialized when the function is called for the first time,
so it is not possible to read its value before the initialization.
In consequence, replacing a global variable with a function that declares a static variable and returns a reference to it eliminates the order of initialization issues.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// header.h
extern std::string s1;
extern std::string s2;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s1 = "Some string";

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s2 = s1 + " in other file"; // Noncompliant: `s1` may be initialized after `s2`
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
// header.h
std::string& getS1();
extern std::string s2;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string& getS1() {
  static std::string s1 = "Some string";
  return s1;
}

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"

std::string s2 = getS1() + " in other file"; // Compliant: `s1` is initialized as part of `getS1()` call
----

While the above is sufficient to fix the issue,
replacing `s2` with a `getS2` function defined in a similar way would prevent future problems.

This solution is also applicable to the variable templates and static data members of class templates.

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename CharT>
std::basic_string<CharT> const basicBuildID = /* runtime initializer */;

std::string const buildID = basicBuildID<char>(); // Noncompliant: `basicBuildID<char>` may not be initialized
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename CharT>
std::basic_string<CharT> const& getBuildID() {
  static std:basic_stirng<CharT> basicBuildID =  /* runtime initializer */;
  return basicBuildID;
}

std::string const buildID = getBuildID<char>(); // Compliant: `basicBuildID` is initialized as part of `getBuildID<char>()` call
----

==== Constant initialization mitigates initialization overhead

As the static function variable is initialized when the funciton is first called,
additional boolean flag need to be stored to indicate that variable is already initialized.
Furthermore, if the function is called from multiple thread, such initalization needs to synchronize until the initialization of variable is finished.

As consequence using static variable have a performance impact related to checks if initialization is required,
however they are not necessary if it is analyzed by compile-time and have constant initialization.

For constant initialized variable, you can force constant initialization, by using:

* `constexpr` (since {cpp}11) if variable is not mutated and have constant destructor,
* `continit` (since {cpp}20) otherwise

=== Define variables as inline in the header

With the introduction of `inline` variables in {cpp}17, non-local variables can now be defined in the header without causing double-definition errors.
Dynamic initialization of any such `inline` variables is performed before any variable that is defined consistently after it in all source files.
This is generally true for variables defined in the same headers or in sources that always include a given header.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// header.h
extern std::string s1;
extern std::string s2;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s1 = "Some string";

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s2 = s1 + " in other file"; // Noncompliant: `s1` may be initialized after `s2`
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
// header.h
inline std::string s1 = "Some string";
extern std::string s2;

// source1.cpp
#include "header.h"

// source2.cpp
#include "header.h"
std::string s2 = s1 + " in other file"; // Compliant: `s1` may be initialized after `s2`
----

Again, declaring `s1` in the header file is sufficient for addressing the issue,
however, changing `s2` to also be declared in the header file will prevent initialization order issues related to it.

==== Use `constinit` for constant initilization

As mentioned in the previous section, combining `inline` and `constexpr` will prevent variable from being defined multiple times,
in different source files. 
Furthermore, since {cpp}20 you can use `constinit` to enforce constant initialization of global variables,
that needs to be mutated.

==== Templates are implicitly `inline`

Instantiations of variable templates and static data members of class template instantiation, are implicitly `inline`.
As a consequence, marking them as `inline` does not impact the order of initialization and does not prevent the issue from occurring.
