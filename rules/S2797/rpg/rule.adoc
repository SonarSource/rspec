== Why is this an issue?

The use of positional notation to describe the overlapping of one field on another can quickly become confusing, particularly in large, or complicated data structures. Instead, the ``++OVERLAY++`` keyword should be used to make such overlaps more readily identifiable.

     D Message         DS                  QUALIFIED
     D   Id                           7
      * Noncompliant
     D   Type                  1      3

     D Message         DS                  QUALIFIED
     D   Id                           7
     D   Type                         3    OVERLAY(Id)
