What about extending RSPEC-1724 [~ann.campbell.2] ? Thanks

\[~freddy.mallet] IIRC, I specifically asked [~nicolas.peru] about that & he saw it as a separate rule. @Nico, am I mis-remembering?

\[~ann.campbell.2]You remember well. 

\[~freddy.mallet] You can have a method that is deprecated but not its enclosing class and therefore you should avoid override this method but not necessarily drop the usage of the class all together (this is not the deprecation path @SonarSource but it is still a valid one) 

And for simplicity and customization matters I would keep that as a separate rule.

Ok fine for me and that means that in following case, I'll get two issues [~ann.campbell.2] and [~nicolas.peru] :

----
@Deprecated
public class Foo {
  public void doSomething(){...}
}

public class Bar extends Foo{    //<- one on the class : RSPEC-1724
  @Override
  public void DoSomething(){...}  //<- one on the rule: this RSPEC
}
