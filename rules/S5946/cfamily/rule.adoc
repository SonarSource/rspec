== Why is this an issue?

When injecting ``++std::endl++`` into an output stream, two things happen:

* An end of line character ``++'\n'++`` is added to the stream
* The stream is flushed

In many situations, you don't need the stream to be flushed: It takes some time, and additionally, the stream is also flushed automatically in several circumstances:

* When the stream is closed
* In the case of ``++std::cout++``, each time an input is read on ``++std::cin++`` or an output is written on ``++std::cerr++``
* In the case of ``++std::cerr++``, each output is immediately written, the is no need to flush

Therefore, if your only goal is to add an end of line, ``++'\n'++`` is usually more efficient than ``++std::endl++``. If you do want to flush, you can be explicit and inject ``++std::flush++`` into the stream, or call the ``++flush++`` member function on the stream.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  cout << "Hello world!" << endl << endl << "How are you?" << endl; // Noncompliant, 3 useless flushes
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  cout << "Starting long operation now..." << endl; // Noncompliant, flushing is useful, but not explicit enough
  longOperation();
  cout << "Long operation is done" << endl; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  cout << R"(Hello world!

How are you?
)" << endl;
  // Or
  cout << "Hello world!\n\nHow are you?\n";
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  cout << "Starting long operation now...\n" << flush;
  longOperation();
  cout << "Long operation is done\n";
}
