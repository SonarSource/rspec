We expect this rule to be quite verbose, for a limited value. But we believe it is still worth having it for its educational value.

We thought about having a rule trying to only detect uses of endl where we are confident that flushing is not needed (``++std::cout << "Hello" << endl << endl;++``) or several consecutive lines using endl without any function call in-between:

----
std::cout << "Hello" << endl;
std::cout << "Hello" << endl;
std::cout << "Hello" << endl;

But we believe it would be another rule (maybe part of SonarWay?), but still not much more valuable. So for now, we decided to stick to the simple rule.


Another option would be to flag only the cases where ``++\n++`` is more succinct than ``++endl++``:


----
std::cout << "Hello" << endl; // Noncompliant because...
std::cout << "Hello\n"; // ...alternative is shorter
std::cout << "Value:" << i << endl; // Compliant because...
std::cout << "Value:" << i << '\n'; // ...alternative is just as complex
----
But it is still favoring performances rather than correctness, which is usually not a great pattern...
