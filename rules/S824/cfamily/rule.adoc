== Why is this an issue?

A function declared at block scope will refer to a member of the enclosing namespace, and so the declaration should be explicitly placed at the namespace level.


Additionally, where a declaration statement could either declare a function or an object, the compiler will choose to declare the function. To avoid potential developer confusion over the meaning of a declaration, functions should not be declared at block scope.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class A {
};

void fun() {
  void nestedFun();  // Noncompliant; declares a function in block scope

  A a();      // Noncompliant; declares a function at block scope, not an object
}
----
