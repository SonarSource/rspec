== Why is this an issue?

For C compatibility, it is possible in {cpp} for a name to refer to both a type and object or a type and function. This can lead to confusion.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct vector {
  // ...
} vector; // Noncompliant, 'vector' is both a tag name and a typedef name.

struct vector {
  // ...
} vector; // Noncompliant, 'vector' is both a tag name and a variable.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct vector {
  // ...
} vector_t; // Compliant

vector_t vector; // Compliant
----

Also, WDYT about switching SQALE to reliability? If the user misunderstands what the identifier refers to, there could be misuse leading to bugs...?
