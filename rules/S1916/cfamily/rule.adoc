== Why is this an issue?

The standard mentions that the line continuation character (``++\++``) should be immediately followed by a newline or be the very last character of the file in order for the lines to be joined.


Several compilers relax this requirement by allowing whitespace after the ``++\++`` character, but this is not portable because other compilers may not do the same.


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
// There should be no whitespace after the '\'
#define FOO BAR \
            BAZ
