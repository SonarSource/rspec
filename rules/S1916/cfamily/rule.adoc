== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/cfamily/line_splicing.adoc[]

Several compilers have a looser implementation of _line-splicing_ and allow whitespace after the `\` character.
While this practice was non-portable until {cpp}23, it remains non-portable in C.
Furthermore, readers can easily be confused about the meaning of these whitespaces.

Therefore, for portability and clarity, `\` should be immediately followed by a newline character, as in the following example.

[source,cpp]
----
// Compliant: there are no whitespaces after the '\'
#define FOO BAR \
            BAZ
----
