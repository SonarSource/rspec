``++java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor++``'s pool is sized with ``++corePoolSize++``, so setting ``++corePoolSize++`` to zero means the executor will have no threads and run nothing.


This rule detects instances where ``++corePoolSize++`` is set to zero, via either its setter or the object constructor.
