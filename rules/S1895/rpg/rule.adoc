== Why is this an issue?

Turning on the ``++*srcstmt++`` header option means that any line numbers cited in error statements will actually correspond correctly to the code. Otherwise, object line numbers will be shown, making errors difficult to debug.


The ``++*srcstmt++`` option is also recommended for accurate line numbers during debugging, particularly in combination with ``++*nodebugio++``, (``++H option(*srcstmt:*nodebugio)++``) which prevents debug operations from stopping on I/O.
