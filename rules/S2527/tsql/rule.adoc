== Why is this an issue?

In a Zen-like manner, "NULL" is never equal to anything, even itself. Therefore comparisons using equality operators will always return ``++False++``, even when the value actually ``++IS NULL++``.


For that reason, comparison operators should never be used to make comparisons with ``++NULL++``; ``++IS NULL++`` and ``++IS NOT NULL++`` should be used instead.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE books
SET title = 'unknown'
WHERE title = NULL -- Noncompliant

=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE books
SET title = 'unknown'
WHERE title IS NULL
