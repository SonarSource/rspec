== Why is this an issue?

To ensure proper testing, it is important to include test methods in a test class. If a test class does not have any test methods, it can give the wrong impression that the class being tested has been thoroughly tested, when in reality, it has not.

This rule will raise an issue when any of these conditions are met:

* For `NUnit`, a class is marked with `TestFixture` but does not contain any method marked with `Test`, `TestCase`, `TestCaseSource`, or `Theory`.
* For `MSTest`, a class is marked with `TestClass` but does not contain any method marked with `TestMethod` or `DataTestMethod`.

It does not apply to `xUnit` since `xUnit` does not provide a https://xunit.net/docs/comparisons#attributes[test class attribute].

=== Exceptions

* `abstract` classes
* derived classes that inherit from a base class that does have test methods
* in `MSTest`, classes that contain methods marked with either `AssemblyInitialize` or `AssemblyCleanup`.
