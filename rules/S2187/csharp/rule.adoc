There's no point in having a test class without any test methods.This could lead a maintainer to assume a class is covered by tests even though it is not.


Supported test frameworks are ``++NUnit++`` and ``++MSTest++`` (not applicable to ``++xUnit++``).

This rule will raise an issue when any of these conditions are met:

* For *NUnit*, a class is marked with ``++TestFixture++`` but does not contain any method marked with ``++Test++``, ``++TestCase++``, ``++TestCaseSource++`` or ``++Theory++``.
* For *MSTest*, a class is marked with ``++TestClass++`` but does not contain any method marked with ``++TestMethod++`` or ``++DataTestMethod++``.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
[TestFixture]
public class SomeClassTest { } // Noncompliant - no test

[TestClass]
public class SomeOtherClassTest { } // Noncompliant - no test
----

== Compliant Solution

----
[TestFixture]
public class SomeClassTest
{
    [Test]
    public void SomeMethodShouldReturnTrue() { }
}

[TestClass]
public class SomeOtherClassTest
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void SomeMethodShouldReturnTrue() { }
}
----

== Exceptions

* abstract classes
* derived classes that inherit from a base class that does have test methods
* in *MSTest*, classes that contain methods marked with either ``++AssemblyInitialize++`` or ``++AssemblyCleanup++``.
