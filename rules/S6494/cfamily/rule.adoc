== Why is this an issue?

In contrast to C printf-like functions, {cpp} provides safer and more robust interfaces for performing text formatting:

* The `std::format` interface family ({cpp}20) allows formatting text into a string.
* The `std::print` interface family ({cpp}23) allows printing formatted text.

{cpp} formatting facilities perform validation of the format string against the type of the formatted argument. If the validation fails, it is reported as a compilation error for the calls of `std::print` and `std::format`. When the format string is not available at compile-time, `std::vformat`, `std::vprint_unicode`, and `std::vprint_nonunicode` can be used. They will report failures at runtime by throwing an instance of `std::format_error`.

Secondly, the relation between the type and format specifier is more abstract.
In particular, `{:d}` can be used to format any integer type, regardless of its size and signedness.
Similarly, `{:f}` works for any floating point type.
Furthermore, `{}` can be used for any type with default format spec, which makes it usable in the generic context.

Finally, the text formatting API was designed with adaptability in mind:

* Formatting of user-defined types is possible with the dedicated format specification via `std::formatter` specializations.

* The string formatting API provides functions for:
  - receiving the formatted text by return - `std::format`.
  - writing the formatted text to an output iterator - `std::format_to`.

* The `std::print` API provides function overloads for:
  - printing implicitly to the standard output.
  - printing to a ``++FILE*++`` handle.
  - printing to a `std::ostream&` object.

This rule raises issues for calls of the `printf`, `fprintf`, `sprintf` and `snprintf` functions that can be replaced by the {cpp} formatting functions.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void printTextIntoBuffer(char* out) {
  // Assumes the buffer pointed-to by out is large enough
  sprintf(out, "%u %s", 10u, "text"); // Noncompliant
}

void printTextIntoSizedBuffer(char* out, size_t n) {
  std::snprintf(out, n, "%i %% %LG", 10, 10.0L); // Noncompliant
}

void printToFile(FILE* f) {
  printf("%i", 10); // Noncompliant since C++23
  std::fprintf(f, "%f", 10.0); // Noncompliant since C++23
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void printTextIntoBuffer(char* out) {
  // Assumes the buffer pointed-to by out is large enough
  std::format_to(out, "{} {}", 10u, "text"); // Compliant
}
// The function can also be redesigned to deal with memory allocation
// and return a string:
std::string getText() {
  return std::format("{} {}", 10u, "text"); // Compliant
}

void printTextIntoSizedBuffer(char* out, size_t n) {
  std::format_to_n(out, n, "{} % {:G}", 10, 10.0L); // Compliant
}

void printToFile(FILE* f) {
  std::print("{}", 10);  // Compliant
  std::print(f, "{}", 10.0);  // Compliant
}
----

=== Exceptions

The rule does not raise an issue if the format string passed to a printf-like function is computed dynamically instead of being spelled in the source code:

[source,cpp]
----
char const* localizedFormatString(unsigned id);
/* â€¦. */
snprintf(buffer, localizedFormatString(123), 10, 20)
----

While `std::vformat` may be used in such cases, it requires changing the format string, which may not be actionable.
