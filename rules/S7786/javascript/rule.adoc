This rule raises an issue when a generic `Error` is thrown immediately after an if-statement that performs type checking operations.

== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript provides specific error types for different kinds of problems. When you're checking types and throwing errors based on those checks, using a generic `Error` is less precise than using `TypeError`.

`TypeError` is the standard JavaScript error type specifically designed for situations where a value is not of the expected type. Using the correct error type makes your code more semantically accurate and helps other developers (and tools) understand what went wrong.

When you use `TypeError` instead of `Error` for type-related issues, you provide better context about the nature of the problem. This makes debugging easier and follows JavaScript best practices for error handling.

The rule recognizes common type checking patterns including:

* `typeof` operator checks
* `instanceof` operator checks  
* Built-in type checking methods like `Array.isArray()`, `Number.isNaN()`, `Number.isInteger()`
* Type checking methods from popular libraries like Underscore, Lodash, and jQuery

=== What is the potential impact?

Using generic `Error` instead of `TypeError` for type-related issues reduces code clarity and makes debugging more difficult. It also goes against JavaScript conventions and best practices for error handling.

=== How to fix?


Replace `Error` with `TypeError` when throwing after type checking conditions. The error message can remain the same.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (Array.isArray(foo) === false) {
	throw new Error('Array expected'); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (Array.isArray(foo) === false) {
	throw new TypeError('Array expected');
}
----
