== Sensitive Code Example

If you create a security-sensitive cookie in your Kotlin code:

----
val c4 = Cookie("admin", "secret")
c4.setSecure(false)  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag set to false
----

By default the https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setSecure(boolean)[``++secure++``] flag is set to _false:_

----
val c5 = Cookie("admin", "secret")  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag not defined (by default set to false)
----

== Compliant Solution

----
val c6 = Cookie("admin", "secret")
c6.setSecure(true) // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag set to true
----
