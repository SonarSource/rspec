== Sensitive Code Example

In _php.ini_ you can specify the flags for the session cookie which is security-sensitive:

----
session.cookie_secure = 0; // Sensitive: this security-sensitive session cookie is created with the secure flag set to false (cookie_secure = 0)
----

Same thing in PHP code:

----
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, false);  
// Sensitive: this security-sensitive session cookie is created with the secure flag (the fourth argument) set to _false_
----

If you create a custom security-sensitive cookie in your PHP code:

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, false);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag  (the sixth argument) set to _false_ 
----

By default https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php[``++setcookie++``] and https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setrawcookie.php[``++setrawcookie++``] functions set the sixth argument / ``++secure++`` flag to _false:_

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag (the sixth argument) not defined (by default to false)
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag (the sixth argument) not defined (by default to false)
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,php]
----
session.cookie_secure = 1; // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to cookie_secure property set to 1
----

[source,php]
----
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (the fouth argument) set to true
----

[source,php]
----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (the sixth  argument) set to true
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true);// Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (the sixth argument) set to true
