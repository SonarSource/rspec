== Sensitive Code Example

In _php.ini_ you can specify the flags for the session cookie which is security-sensitive:

----
session.cookie_secure = 0; // Sensitive: this security-sensitive session cookie is created with the secure flag set to false (cookie_secure = 0)
----

Same thing in PHP code:

----
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, false);  
// Sensitive: this security-sensitive session cookie is created with the secure flag (the fourth argument) set to _false_
----

If you create a custom security-sensitive cookie in your PHP code:

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, false);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag  (the sixth argument) set to _false_ 
----

By default https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php[``++setcookie++``] and https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setrawcookie.php[``++setrawcookie++``] functions set the sixth argument / ``++secure++`` flag to _false:_

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag (the sixth argument) not defined (by default to false)
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag (the sixth argument) not defined (by default to false)
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,php]
----
session.cookie_secure = 1; // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to cookie_secure property set to 1
----

[source,php]
----
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (the fouth argument) set to true
----

[source,php]
----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (the sixth  argument) set to true
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true);// Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (the sixth argument) set to true

By default, cookies are not secured. It seems that there are several ways to have an impact on that behavior:

* through a php.ini configuration: http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.cookie-secure[session.cookie_secure]
* by changing the configuration inside PHP code with http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-cookie-params.php[session_set_cookie_params]
* when creating a cookie in PHP code: http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php[setcookie ]

Looks fine [~pierre-yves.nicolas], but wouldn't a variable named $cookie_security be clearer & allow shorter comments?

Sorry [~ann.campbell.2], I don't see how that variable would be used.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] like so:


----
; php.ini
session.cookie_secure = 0 ; Noncompliant

$session_cookie_secure = false;
// in PHP code
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, $session_cookie_secure); // Noncompliant

setcookie ($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, $session_cookie_secure); // Noncompliant

I'm trying to make the code itself more self-explanatory

I now understand [~ann.campbell.2]. Of course, it's harder to implement, and requires symbolic execution for the most general case.

Ah. And now _I_ understand.
