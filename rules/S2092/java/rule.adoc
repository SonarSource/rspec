== Sensitive Code Example

If you create a security-sensitive cookie in your JAVA code:

----
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setSecure(false);  // Sensitive: a security-ensitive cookie is created with the secure flag set to false 
----

By default the https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setSecure(boolean)[``++secure++``] flag is set to _false:_

----
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag not defined (by default set to false)
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,java]
----
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setSecure(true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag set to true
----
