This rule requires that any reliance on undefined and unspecified behaviour, which is not specifically addressed by other rules, shall be avoided. Where a specific behaviour is explicitly covered in another rule, only that specific rule needs to be deviated if required. See ISO 9899:1990 Appendix G for a complete list of these issues.
