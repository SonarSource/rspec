.NET 6 introduced two new structs, `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly`. Before the existence of these types, if users wanted to represent only a date, they had to use the `DateTime` struct, set only the date-related properties and leave the time-related properties with the default values. The `DateTime` structure is pointing by default to midnight of the provided date and observing such an instance of `DateTime` creates confusion about its intention.
The same applies to the case of time-only usage, with the only difference being that there is no constructor that takes only time-related properties so in most cases developers set the date to January the first of year 1.

This rule will raise only if the `DateTime` object is not modified later in the same code block, as this scenario can be valid if some other types are converted to `DateTime` by aritmetic operations.
