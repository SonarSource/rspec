With .NET 6 two new types were introduced the `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly` structs. Before this introduction, if users wanted to represent dates they had to use the `DateTime` struct and set only the date-related properties.
This left the time-related properties with the default values and so, the `DateTime` structure was overall pointing to midnight of the provided date, and one could not tell by just looking at the object if it was "date only" or not.
The same applies to the case of time-only usage, with the only difference being that there is no constructor that takes only time-related properties so in most cases developers set the date to January the first of year 1.
