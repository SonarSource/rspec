Creating date-only or time-only `DateTime` instances may create confusion as the object will point to a time and a date anyway. At later consumption of the instance, one will not be able to tell if the intention was to use only the date, only the time or both.
Additionally the `DateTime` structure may roll into the previous or next day if it's offset by a time zone. `DateOnly` can't be offset by a time zone, and it always represents the date that was set.
