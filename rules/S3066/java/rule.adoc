== Why is this an issue?

``++enum++``s are generally thought of as constant, but an ``++enum++`` with a ``++public++`` field or ``++public++`` setter is non-constant. Ideally fields in an ``++enum++`` are ``++private++`` and set in the constructor, but if that's not possible, their visibility should be reduced as much as possible.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public enum Continent {

  NORTH_AMERICA (23, 24709000),
  // ...
  EUROPE (50, 39310000);

  public int countryCount;  // Noncompliant
  private int landMass;

  Continent(int countryCount, int landMass) { 
    // ...
  }

  public void setLandMass(int landMass) {  // Noncompliant
    this.landMass = landMass;
  }
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public enum Continent {

  NORTH_AMERICA (23, 24709000),
  // ...
  EUROPE (50, 39310000);

  private int countryCount; 
  private int landMass;

  Continent(int countryCount, int landMass) { 
    // ...
  }
