Deprecated instructions should be replaced by other suggested instructions.

== Why is this an issue?

Languages and technologies evolve, which leads to deprecation of some features.
At some day they may be removed.
It is important to use up-to-date constructs to avoid issues by migration to newer version of technology.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
MAINTAINER bob
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="bob"
----

=== How does this work?

The `LABEL` instruction is much more flexible than `MAINTAINER` and should be used instead.
