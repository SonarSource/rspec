== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

Attackers with access to an Artifactory API key will be able to use this API
with all the permissions the corresponding user has been granted with.

=== What is the potential impact?

The consequences vary depending on the compromised account entitlement but can
range from proprietary information leaks to severe supply chain attacks.

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/data_compromise.adoc[]

In the case of Artifactory repositories, if they contain private code or
software, attackers will be able to steal those. They could use this software
for their own use, to look for further exploitable vulnerability, or disclose it
publicly, with or without asking for a ransom.
