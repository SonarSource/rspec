This rule raises an issue when published files contain `import` declarations that reference unpublished files or `devDependencies`.

== Why is this an issue?

When you publish a Node.js package with `npm publish`, only certain files are included in the published package. Files are considered published if they are included in the `"files"` field of `package.json` or not excluded by `.npmignore`.

If published code imports unpublished files or development dependencies (`devDependencies`), users who install your package will encounter "Module Not Found" errors because these dependencies are not available in the published package.

This commonly happens when:

* Development tools or testing libraries are imported in production code
* Internal files that aren't meant to be published are referenced by published code

The rule helps prevent these runtime errors by catching these problematic imports during development.

=== What is the potential impact?

Applications using the published package will fail at runtime with "Module Not Found" errors when trying to import the missing dependencies. This can cause complete application failures and poor user experience.

=== How to fix?


Remove the import of the unpublished module or move the importing file to an unpublished location.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// In a published file
import testHelper from './test/helper.js'; // Noncompliant - test files are typically unpublished
import devTool from 'some-dev-dependency'; // Noncompliant - devDependency not available after publish
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Remove the problematic imports
// import testHelper from './test/helper.js'; 
// import devTool from 'some-dev-dependency';

// Or move this file to an unpublished location like test/ folder
----
