Unlike class and instance methods, static methods don't receive an implicit first argument. Nonetheless naming the first argument ``++self++`` or ``++cls++`` guarantees confusion - either on the part of the original author, who may never understand why the arguments don't hold the values he expected, or on that of future maintainers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyClass:
  @staticmethod
  def s_meth(self, arg1, arg2):  #Noncompliant
    # ...
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class MyClass:
  @staticmethod
  def s_meth(arg1, arg2):  #Noncompliant
    # ...
