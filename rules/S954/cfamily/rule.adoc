== Why is this an issue?

To aid code readability, all the ``++#include++`` directives in a particular code file should be grouped together near the top of the file. The only items which may precede an ``++#include++`` in a file are other preprocessor directives or comments.

Additionally, an `#include` may appear within an `extern "C"` block, this can be used for instance to include a C file from a C++ file.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <h1.h> /* Compliant */
int32_t i;
#include <f2.h> /* Noncompliant */
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#include <h1.h>
#include <f2.h>
extern "C" {
#include <f3.h>    
}

int32_t i;
----
