Mounting sensitive file system paths can lead to information disclosure and compromise of the host systems.

System paths can contain sensitive information like configuration files or cache files.
Those might be used by attackers to expand permissions or to collect information for further attacks.
System paths can also contain binaries and scripts that might be executed by the host system periodically.
A compromised or rogue container with access to sensitive files could endanger the integrity of the whole Kubernetes cluster.
