== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}14 adds the ability to write numbers with digit separators for better readability. Splitting a number that has more than 4 consecutive digits improves readability.


This rule verifies that numbers are written using digit separators when they have more than 4 consecutive digits.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
long decimal_int_value     = 5543124;            // Noncompliant; insert ' between groups of 3 digits.
double decimal_float_value = 7918714.3456;       // Noncompliant; insert ' between groups of 3 digits.
long hexadecimal_value     = 0x83A32486E2;       // Noncompliant; insert ' between groups of 2 or 4 digits.
long octal_value           = 04420343313726;     // Noncompliant; insert ' between groups of 2, 3 or 4 digits.
long binary_value          = 0b0101011011101010; // Noncompliant; insert ' between groups of 2, 3 or 4 digits.

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
long decimal_int_value     = 5'543'124;
double decimal_float_value = 7'918'714.3456;
long hexadecimal_value     = 0x83'A324'86E2;
long octal_value           = 04'4203'4331'3726;
long binary_value          = 0b0101'0110'1110'1010;
----


=== Exceptions

No issue is raised on the fractional or exponent part of floating point numbers, only the integral part should comply.

But regarding hexadecimal/octal/binary, the opposite was the truth. I've never seen groups from 3 digits.

Usually, for hexadecimal and octal it's 2 or 4 digits. And for binary it's 4 or 8 digits (but with 8 it is difficult to read, we should enforce a maximum of 4).

long hexadecimal_value = 0x83'A324'86E2;
long octal_value       = 04'4203'4331'3726;
long binary_value      = 0b0101'0110'1110'1010;

I'm changing the message and description accordingly.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I have changed this RSPEC and the RSPEC-3543 to split them differently:

* RSPEC-3542 Digit separators should be used
  Minor, promote good practice, doesn't ensure any grouping size just propose to use digit separators, not active by default because require {cpp}14 and could raises a lot of issues

* RSPEC-3543 Only standard grouping should be used with digit separators
  Critical, bug, active by default because only raises issue when digit separators are badly used, so implicitly only {cpp}14 projects will have issues. And it's not anymore "homogeneous grouping" but more generally "standard grouping".
