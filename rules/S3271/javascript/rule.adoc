== Why is this an issue?

Session storage and local storage are HTML 5 features which allow developers to easily store megabytes of data client-side, as opposed to the 4Kb cookies can accommodate. While useful to speed applications up on the client side, it can be dangerous to store sensitive information this way because the data is not encrypted by default and any script on the page may access it.


This rule raises an issue when the ``++localStorage++`` and ``++sessionStorage++`` API's are used.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
localStorage.setItem("login", login); // Noncompliant
sessionStorage.setItem("sessionId", sessionId); // Noncompliant
----

\[~linda.martin] please take note of SQALE as you review. From a practical standpoint I'm imagining one issue per file (on first use?) with cost incremented per use of the API. Usually we use linear-with-offset for things related to size, but fixing this will require a large initial investment in design and implementation of a different approach, and then incremental effort to address each use of the API. 


Do you agree that this is appropriate? Or should we just assess one high cost per file?

Should be deprecated because:

* No compliant solution to propose
* Could be noisy, localStorage / sessionStorage use is very common
