== Why is this an issue?

Generating random floating point values to cast them to integers is inefficient.
A random bounded integer value can be generated with a single proper method call.
Use `nextInt` to make the code more efficient and the intent clearer.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
Random r = new Random();
int rand = (int) (r.nextDouble() * 50);  // Noncompliant way to get a pseudo-random value between 0 and 50
int rand2 = (int) r.nextFloat(); // Noncompliant; will always be 0;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
Random r = new Random();
int rand = r.nextInt(50);  // returns pseudo-random value between 0 and 50
----
