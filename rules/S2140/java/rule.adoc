== Why is this an issue?

There is no need to multiply the output of ``++Random++``'s ``++nextDouble++`` method to get a random integer. Use the ``++nextInt++`` method instead.


This rule raises an issue when the return value of any of ``++Random++``'s methods that return a floating point value is converted to an integer.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
Random r = new Random();
int rand = (int)r.nextDouble() * 50;  // Noncompliant way to get a pseudo-random value between 0 and 50
int rand2 = (int)r.nextFloat(); // Noncompliant; will always be 0;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
Random r = new Random();
int rand = r.nextInt(50);  // returns pseudo-random value between 0 and 50
----
