== Why is this an issue?

An inherited member function can be hidden in a derived class and that creates a class that behaves differently depending on which interface is used to manipulate it.


Overriding happens when the inherited method is virtual and a method declared in the derived class uses the same identifier as well as the same signature (the return types can be different, as long as they are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)[covariant]). However, if the inherited method is non-virtual or if the two declarations of the method do not share the same signature, the method of the base class will be hidden.


Such a class increases the inheritance complexity and confuses consumers with its non-polymorphic behavior, which can lead to errors.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class Base {
public:
  void shutdown();
  virtual void log(int a);
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  void shutdown(); //Noncompliant
  void log(float a); //Noncompliant
};

void stopServer(Base *obj, Derived *obj2) {
  obj->shutdown(); // always calls Base::shutdown even if the given object's type is Derived
  obj->log(2); // calls Base::log(int) even if the given object's type is Derived
  obj2->shutdown(); // calls Derived::shutdown
  obj2->log(2); // calls Derived::log(float), even if this requires a conversion int->float.
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class Base {
public:
  void shutdown();
  virtual void log(int a);
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  void shutdownAndUpdate(); // Define a method with a different name
  void log(int a) override; // Or make the method a proper override
};

void stopServer(Base *obj) {
  obj->shutdown(); // calls Base::shutdown and there is no confusion
  obj->log(2); // calls Derived::log(int) if the given object's type is Derived
}
----

== How to fix it
The first step is to determine what is the expected behavior. Let us see two common situations.

////
- You want the derived class function to override a base class function instead of hiding it. In that case, mark the function as `virtual` in the base class and as `override` in the derived class.
- You want the derived class to extend the overload set for the function in the base class. To do so, add a using declaration to import the base class functions in the derived class and avoid hiding.
////
=== Function that should have been virtual

In the following example, the intent for the `draw` function was to be virtual, but the keyword was forgotten.
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Shape {
  void draw();
}

class Rectangle : public Shape {
  void draw(); // Noncompliant
}
----

As a consequence, the following code will not behave as expected:
[source,cpp]
----
Rectangle r;
Shape &s = r;
s.draw(); // Calls Shape::draw, not Rectangle::draw
----

This code can be rewritten:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Shape {
  virtual void draw(); // Should probably be virtual void draw() = 0
}

class Rectangle : public Shape {
  void draw() override;
}
----

=== Creating an overload set
For the following example, the intent is to add an overload to a nonvirtual function in the derived class:

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Vehicle {
  void drive(double targetSpeed);
};

class MedicalVehicle {
  void drive(double targetSpeed, double maxAcceleration);
}
----

Here, the goal is that a user of the derived class should be able to choose between two overloads for `drive`. However, this is not how it works: `MedicalVehicle::drive` hides the base class function `Vehicle::drive`.

[source,cpp]
----
MedicalVehicle mv;
mv.drive(50); // Compiler error
----

The best way to build the right overload set in this case is to import the base class' functions through a using declaration:
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Vehicle {
  void drive(double targetSpeed);
};

class MedicalVehicle {
  using Vehicle::drive;
  void drive(double targetSpeed, double maxAcceleration);
}
----

Now, the call `mv.drive(50)` compiles and calls `Vehicle::drive`.

Rename this member function so that it doesn't hide an inherited non-virtual function, or make it virtual in the base class "XXX".

"XXX" hides overloaded virtual functions
