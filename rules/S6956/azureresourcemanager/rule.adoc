== Why is this an issue?

According to the best practices defined by Azure, a consistent order of properties and elements in a templates is recommended.
This makes it easier to read and understand the template.

Not following this convention has no technical impact,
but will reduce the template's readability because most developers are used to the standard order.

Sorting the resources according to deployment order is recommended as well, as this will convey the intent of the orchestration.

== How to fix it in ARM Templates

*Recommended order of the top-level template properties*:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/...",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "metadata": {},
  "apiProfile": "...",
  "parameters": {},
  "functions": {},
  "variables": {},
  "resources": [],
  "outputs": {}
}
----

*Recommended order of the resource properties*:

[source,json]
----
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "comments": "if any",
      "condition": true,
      "scope": "% parent scope %",
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
      "apiVersion": "2023-09-01",
      "name": "resourceName",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "zones": [],
      "sku": {},
      "kind": "",
      "scale": "",
      "plan": {},
      "identity": {},
      "copy": {},
      "dependsOn": [],
      "tags": {},
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}
----

Any other properties or elements not listed here should be placed before the `properties` object for the resource.

== How to fix it in Bicep

*Recommended order of the top-level template properties*:

[source,bicep]
----
targetScope ...
metadata ...
param ...
func ...
var ...
resource ... // (existing resources collected together)
resource ... // (new resources)
module ...
output ...
----

*Recommended order of the resource properties and decorators*:

[source,bicep]
----
@description
@batchSize
resource resourceName
  parent
  scope
  name
  location/extendedLocation
  zones
  sku
  kind
  scale
  plan
  identity
  dependsOn
  tags
  properties
----

Any other decorated not listed here should be placed before the `resource` object and after the other decorators.
Any other properties or elements not listed here should be placed before the `properties` object for the resource.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

In case of wrong order of top-level and resource elements: 

* Reorder the elements to match the recommended order.

In case of wrong order in decorators:

Reorder the decorators to match the recommended order.

=== Highlighting

In general, we want to highlight all the keys of elements that are in the wrong order.

For wrong order in top-level elements:

* The first wrongly ordered key should be highlighted as primary issue and the others as secondary locations.

For wrong order in a resource:

* The name of the resource / key of the resource should be highlighted as a primary issues.
All the wrongly ordered key should be highlighted as secondary locations.
