== Why is this an issue?

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public void doSomething(File file, Lock lock) {
  file.delete();  // Noncompliant
  // ...
  lock.tryLock(); // Noncompliant
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public void doSomething(File file, Lock lock) {
  if (!lock.tryLock()) {
    // lock failed; take appropriate action
  }
  if (!file.delete()) {
    // file delete failed; take appropriate action
  }
}

Hi @Ann, I let you specify this one and would only track call to File.delete() for the time being. Thanks

Updated to add case of ``++Lock.tryLock()++``.

``++File.mkdirs++`` excluded because Javadoc says: "true if and only if the directory was created, along with all necessary parent directories; false otherwise." Meaning that it will return ``++true++`` if it had to create the dir and ``++false++`` if the dir already existed. Either way, I have my dir.
