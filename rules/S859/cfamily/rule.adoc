Using ``++const++`` in your code improves reliability and maintenance. When passing a ``++const++`` value, developers assume that its value won't be changed. But using ``++const_cast<>()++`` to cast away a ``++const++`` qualifier, destroys developer assumptions and code reliability. It is a bad practice and reveals a flaw in the design. Furthermore, it may have an undefined behavior.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
User& func(const int& value, const User& user) {
  const_cast<int&>(value) = 2; // Noncompliant and undefined behavior
  return const_cast<User&>(user); // Noncompliant
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
User& func(int& value, User& user) {
  value = 2;
  return user;
}
----
