== Why is this an issue?

Objects should be initialized as soon as they are declared. It will be implicitly the case if they have a default constructor, as this latter will be called, but otherwise the initialization must be explicit. Even when an object has a default constructor, it may be interesting to use another more relevant constructor to directly give the the object its right value.


Such direct initialization increases the readability of the code:

* seeing the initial value of a variable is usually a good indicator of its purpose,
* waiting until we know a good initial value before declaring a variable can lead to a reduced variable scope,
* it makes reasoning on the source code simpler: we remove the burden of having to know if a variable is initialized at a specific point in the code,
* it is a first step that can lead to the possibility of declaring the variable ``++const++``, which further simplifies reasoning,
* it is also a first step toward declaring it ``++auto++``, which could increase readability by shifting the focus away from the exact type.

Please note that the intent of the rule is not to initialize any variable with some semi-random value, but with the value that is meaningful for this variable.


This rule raises an issue when a local variable of a built-in or pointer type is declared without an initial value.


The related rule S836 detects situations when a variable is actually read before being initialized, while this rule promotes the good practice of systematically initializing the variable.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
double init1();
double init2();
double init3();
double init4();

void f(bool b) {
  int i; // Noncompliant
  string s; // Compliant: default constructor will be called, but we could probably find a better value

  double d1; // Noncompliant
  double d2; // Noncompliant
  if (b) {
    d1 = init1();
    d2 = init2();
  } else {
    d1 = init3();
    d2 = init4();
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
double init1();
double init2();
double init3();
double init4();

std::pair<double, double> init(bool b) {
    return b ? std::make_pair(init1(), init2()) : std::make_pair(init3(), init4());
}

void f(bool b) {
  int i = 0;
  string s;

  auto [d1, d2] = init(b);  
}

// Or:
void f(bool b) {
  auto [d1, d2] = [b](){
    if (b) {
      return std::make_pair(init1(), init2());
    } else {
      return std::make_pair(init3(), init4());
    }
  }();
}
----


=== Exceptions

Buffers can be left uninitialized as long as they are written into immediately after their declarations.

[source,cpp]
----
  int buf[10]; // allowed but it should be initialized right after the declaration  
----
