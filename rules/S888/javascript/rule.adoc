== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 1; i != 10; i += 2)  // Noncompliant. Infinite; i goes from 9 straight to 11.
{
  //...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2)  // Compliant
{
  //...
}
----

=== Exceptions

Equality operators are ignored if the loop counter is not modified within the body of the loop and either:

* starts below the ending value and is incremented by 1 on each iteration.
* starts above the ending value and is decremented by 1 on each iteration.

Equality operators are also ignored when the test is against ``++null++``.

[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; arr[i] != null; i++) {
  // ...
}

for (var i = 0; (item = arr[i]) != null; i++) {
  // ...
}
----
