== Why is this an issue?

This rule is a strict implementation of a MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) rule. MISRA defines best practices for developing safety-critical software. You can learn more about this rule in the MISRA documents referenced below.


If you are not concerned with MISRA compliance or with safety-critical software, you might consider using rule S1003 instead ; it targets the same kind of issue for general-purpose software.
