=== Exceptions

Equality operators are ignored if the loop counter is not modified within the body of the loop and either:

* starts below the ending value and is incremented by 1 on each iteration.
* starts above the ending value and is decremented by 1 on each iteration.

Equality operators are also ignored when the test is against ``++null++``.
