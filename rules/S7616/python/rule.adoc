This rule raises an issue when `torch.log(1 + x)` is used instead of the numerically stable `torch.log1p(x)` function.

== Why is this an issue?

When computing the logarithm of `1 + x`, using `torch.log(1 + x)` can lead to numerical precision problems, especially when `x` is close to zero.

In floating-point arithmetic, adding a small number to 1 can result in precision loss due to the limited number of significant digits that can be represented. For example, if `x` is very small (like `1e-15`), the computation `1 + x` might not accurately represent the true mathematical result due to rounding errors.

The `torch.log1p(x)` function is specifically designed to compute `log(1 + x)` accurately for small values of `x`. It uses specialized algorithms that avoid the intermediate step of computing `1 + x` explicitly, thereby preserving numerical precision.

This precision difference can be critical in machine learning applications where:

* Small numerical errors can accumulate over many iterations
* Gradient computations depend on accurate function evaluations
* Loss functions often involve logarithmic terms that are sensitive to precision

Using the numerically stable alternative ensures more reliable and accurate computations, particularly in scenarios involving small values or when high precision is required.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `torch.log(1 + x)` instead of `torch.log1p(x)` can lead to numerical instability and reduced precision in computations. This can result in:

* Inaccurate gradient calculations during training
* Convergence issues in optimization algorithms
* Reduced model performance due to accumulated numerical errors
* Inconsistent results across different hardware or precision settings

=== How to fix?


Replace `torch.log(1 + x)` with `torch.log1p(x)` to use the numerically stable logarithm function. The `log1p` function computes `log(1 + x)` accurately even when `x` is very small.
