== Why is this an issue?

A `CATCH` clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the `CATCH` altogether and letting it bubble up automatically.

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 1/0;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH -- Noncompliant
    THROW;
END CATCH;
----

Such clauses should either be removed or populated with the appropriate logic.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 1/0;
----

or

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 1/0;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    EXECUTE usp_GetErrorInfo; 
    THROW;
END CATCH;
