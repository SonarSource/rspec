A ``++catch++`` clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the ``++catch++`` altogether and letting it bubble up automatically, but with more code and the additional detriment of leaving maintainers scratching their heads. 


Such clauses should either be eliminated or populated with the appropriate logic.
