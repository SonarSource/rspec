An ``++EXCEPTION WHEN ... THEN++`` clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the ``++EXCEPTION++`` clause altogether and letting it bubble up automatically, but with more code and the additional detriment of leaving maintainers scratching their heads. 


Such clauses should either be eliminated or populated with the appropriate logic.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
BEGIN
  SELECT 1/0;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN
    RAISE; -- Noncompliant
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE; -- Noncompliant
END; 
----

== Compliant Solution

----
BEGIN
  SELECT 1/0;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN  -- Compliant: handles 'division by zero' error
    -- do something to manage the division by zero
    COMMIT;

  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    ROLLBACK;
END;
