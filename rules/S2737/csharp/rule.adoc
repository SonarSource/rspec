== Exceptions

This rule will not generate issues for ``++catch++`` blocks with just ``++throw++`` inside if they are followed by a ``++catch++`` block for a more general exception type that does more than just rethrowing the exception.

var s = ""
try

    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName);

catch (IOException) // Compliant, if removed will change the logic
{
    throw;

catch (Exception)  // Compliant, does more than just rethrow
{
    logger.LogError(e);
    throw;
