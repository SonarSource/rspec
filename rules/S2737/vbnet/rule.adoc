== Why is this an issue?

A `Catch` clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the `Catch` altogether and letting it bubble up automatically. 

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As Exception
    Throw
End Try
----

Such clauses should either be removed or populated with the appropriate logic.

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
----

or

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As Exception
    logger.LogError(e)
    Throw
End Try
----

=== Exceptions

This rule will not generate issues for `Catch` blocks if they are followed by a `Catch` block for a more general exception type that does more than just rethrowing the exception.


[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As IOException 'Compliant by exception: removing it would change the logic
    Throw
Catch e As Exception 'Compliant: does more than just rethrow
    logger.LogError(e)
    Throw
End Try
