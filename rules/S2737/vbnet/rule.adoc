== Why is this an issue?

A ``++Catch++`` clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the ``++Catch++`` altogether and letting it bubble up automatically, but with more code and the additional detriment of leaving maintainers scratching their heads. 


Such clauses should either be eliminated or populated with the appropriate logic.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As Exception
    Throw
End Try
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As Exception
    logger.LogError(e)
    Throw
End Try
----
or

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
----

=== Exceptions

This rule will not generate issues for ``++Catch++`` blocks with just ``++Throw++`` inside if they are followed by a ``++Catch++`` block for a more general exception type that does more than just rethrowing the exception.


[source,vbnet]
----
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As IOException 'Compliant, if removed will change the logic
    Throw
Catch e As Exception 'Compliant, does more than just rethrow
    logger.LogError(e)
    Throw
End Try
