== Why is this an issue?

Logical AND (`&&`) operator is sometimes used to conditionally render in React (aka short-circuit evaluation). For example, `myCondition && <MyElement />` will return `<MyElement />` if `myCondition` is `true` and `false` otherwise. 

React considers `false` as a 'hole' in the JSX tree, just like `null` or `undefined`, and doesn't render anything in its place. But if the condition has a `falsy` non-boolean value (e.g. `0`), that value will leak into the rendered result.

This rule will report when the condition has type `number` or `bigint`.

In the case of React Native, the type `string` will also raise an error, as your render method will crash if you render `0`, `''`, or `NaN`.

[source,javascript]
----
function Profile(props) {
  return <div>
    <h1>{ props.username }</h1>
    { props.orders && <Orders /> } { /* Noncompliant: 0 will be rendered if no orders available */ }
  </div>
}
----

Instead, make the left-hand side a boolean to avoid accidental renderings. 

[source,javascript]
----
function Profile(props) {
  return <div>
    <h1>{ props.username }</h1>
    { props.orders > 0 && <Orders /> }
  </div>;
}
----

Another alternative to achieve conditional rendering is using the ternary operator (`myCondition ? <MyElement /> : null`), which is less error-prone in this case as both return values are explicit.

[source,javascript]
----
function Profile(props) {
  return <div>
    <h1>{ props.username }</h1>
    { props.orders ? <Orders /> : null }
  </div>;
}
