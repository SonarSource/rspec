This rule raises an issue when `torch.save()` is called with a method reference instead of a method call, such as `model.state_dict` instead of `model.state_dict()`.

== Why is this an issue?

When you save a PyTorch model's state, you need to save the actual state dictionary, not a reference to the method that returns it.

In Python, `model.state_dict` without parentheses refers to the method object itself, while `model.state_dict()` with parentheses calls the method and returns the state dictionary.

If you save the method reference, PyTorch will serialize a function object instead of the model's parameters and buffers. When you later try to load this saved file, PyTorch expects a dictionary but receives a function object, causing an `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'copy'`.

This error typically occurs during model loading when PyTorch tries to call `.copy()` on what it expects to be a state dictionary but is actually a function object.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue causes runtime errors when loading saved models, leading to:

* Application crashes during model loading
* Failed deployments in production environments  
* Interrupted training workflows
* Loss of training progress if the error is discovered late

=== Code examples 

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Saves method reference instead of state dictionary
torch.save(model.state_dict, 'model.pth')  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Calls method to get and save the state dictionary
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
----
