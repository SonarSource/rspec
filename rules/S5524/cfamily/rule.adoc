== Why is this an issue?

_Mutexes_ are synchronization primitives that allow to manage concurrency. It is a common situation to have to lock multiple _mutexes_ simultaneously to get access to several resources at the same time.


If this is not done properly, it can lead to deadlocks or crashes. If one thread acquires A then tries to acquire B, while another thread acquires B then tries to acquire A, both threads will wait for each other forever.


In such a case, a commonly accepted good practice is to define an order on the _mutexes_ and to lock them in that order and unlock them in the reverse order. However, such an order is not always clearly defined or easy to ensure across a whole program.


{cpp} provides facilities to lock multiple _mutexes_ in one go, with a dedicated deadlock prevention algorithm. They should be used instead. Before {cpp}17, you should use ``++std::lock++``, and since {cpp}17 you can use a variadic constructor of ``++std::scoped_lock++``. See the examples for more details.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void g();

std::mutex m1;
std::mutex m2;

void f() {
  // The example would be the same with std::lock_guard if C++17 std::scoped_lock is not available
  std::scoped_lock<std::mutex> lck1(m1); // Compliant: first mutex acquired
  std::scoped_lock<std::mutex> lck2(m2); // Noncompliant: acquiring several mutexes
  g();
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void g();

std::mutex m1;
std::mutex m2;

void f() { // Compliant: C++11 solution
  std::lock(m1, m2);
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lck1(m1, std::adopt_lock);
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lck2(m2, std::adopt_lock);
  g();
}

void f() { // Compliant: C++17 solution
  std::scoped_lock<std::mutex, std::mutex> lck1(m1, m2);
  g();
}
