SSH keys stored and managed in a project's metadata can be used to access GCP VM instances. By default, GCP automatically deploys project-level SSH keys to VM instances when they are created on the corresponding project. 

This can lead to unauthorized access because:

* This feature doesn't allow a fine-grained access control at the VM level, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[the principle of least privilege] is not guaranteed.
* It can be difficult to manually manage these keys depending on the management of users and permissions. For example, if a user leaves a project, its SSH key should be removed from metadata. 
* If a project-level SSH key is compromised, all VM instances may be compromised.
