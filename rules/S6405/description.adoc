SSH keys stored and managed in a project's metadata can be used to access GCP VM instances. By default, GCP automatically deploys project-level SSH keys to VM instances.


Project-level SSH keys can lead to unauthorized access because:

* Their use prevents fine-grained VM-level access control and makes it difficult to follow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[the principle of least privilege].
* Unlike managed access control with https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access[OS Login], manual cryptographic key management is error-prone and requires careful attention. For example, if a user leaves a project, their SSH keys should be removed from the metadata to prevent unwanted access.
* If a project-level SSH key is compromised, all VM instances may be compromised.
