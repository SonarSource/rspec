== Why is this an issue?

While ``++null++`` is technically a valid ``++Boolean++`` value, that fact, and the distinction between ``++Boolean++`` and ``++boolean++`` is easy to forget. So returning ``++null++`` from a ``++Boolean++`` method is likely to cause problems with callers' code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public Boolean isUsable() {
  // ...
  return null;  // Noncompliant
}
----
