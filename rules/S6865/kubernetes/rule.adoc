== Why is this an issue?

Service account tokens are Kubernetes secrets to authenticate applications
running inside pods to the API server. If a pod is compromised, an attacker
could use this token to gain access to other resources in the cluster.

For example, they could create new pods, modify existing ones, or even delete
critical system pods, depending on the permissions associated with the service
account.

=== What is the potential impact?

==== Unauthorized Access
If a pod with a mounted service account gets compromised, an attacker could potentially use the token to interact with the Kubernetes API, possibly leading to unauthorized access to other resources in the cluster.

==== Privilege Escalation
Service account tokens are often bound with roles that have extensive permissions. If these tokens are exposed, it could lead to privilege escalation where an attacker gains higher-level permissions than intended.

==== Data Breach
Service account tokens can be used to access sensitive data stored in the Kubernetes cluster. If these tokens are compromised, it could lead to a data breach.

==== Denial of Service
An attacker with access to a service account token could potentially overload the Kubernetes API server by sending a large number of requests, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.


== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

In this example, the service account token is mounted in the pod `example-pod`
by default, but is unnecessary for the pod and its service(s) to function
correctly.

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec: # Noncompliant
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
----

In this example, the service account token is mounted in the pod `example-pod`
and is necessary, for example because it allows a third-party service to
authenticate with the Kubernetes API. However, no specific permissions are
granted to the service account:

[source,yaml,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: example-sa # Noncompliant
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
----

In the following example, Role bindings are created, but Cluster Role Bindings
would be more appropriate if the service account is intended to be used across
multiple namespaces:

[source,yaml,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: example-sa
  namespace: default
  
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: example-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["list"]

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: example-role-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: example-sa
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: example-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: example-sa
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
----

=== How does this work?

The essential part of the solution is to make sure that permissions within the
cluster are constructed in a way that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

To do so, it follows a least-privilege approach.

1. If the service account token is unnecessary for the pod to function, disable automounting.
2. If the service account token is required, ensure that the service account has
   the least amount of permissions necessary to perform its function.

Additionally, service account token automounting can be disabled directly from
the service account specification file.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

* If the Service Account specification is available or if `serviceAccountName` is available in the Base resource:
** Bind this Service Account to RBAC or disable `automountServiceAccountToken`.
* Bind this resource's automounted service account to RBAC or disable automounting.

=== Highlighting

* If the Service Account specification is available: Highlight its `name` field.
* Else if `serviceAccountName` is available in the Base resource: Highlight the `serviceAccountName` field.
* Else: Highlight the `containers` property
