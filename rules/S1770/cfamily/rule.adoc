== Why is this an issue?

The use of C headers and therefore C functions in a {cpp} program, is sometimes necessary, but should be avoided in favor of {cpp} headers and functions.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <string.h>
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
