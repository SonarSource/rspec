== Why is this an issue?

``++IF++`` blocks that contain too many lines are difficult to read and understand. 


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the contents of the ``++IF++`` block into multiple, well-named subroutines or subfunctions, each of which focuses on a well-defined task. Those smaller subroutines will not only be easier to understand, but probably also easier to test.
