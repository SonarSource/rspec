== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++pytest.raises++`` or ``++unittest.TestCase.assertRaises++`` will assert that an exception is raised in the following block. Ending such block in an assertion means that the test can succeed with that last assertion never being executed.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
import pytest
def foo(): return 1 / 0
def bar(): return 42
def test_something():
  with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
    foo()
    assert bar() == 42  # Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
import pytest
def foo(): return 1 / 0
def bar(): return 42
def test_something():
  with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
    foo()
  assert bar() == 42
