When using nested deployments in Azure, template expressions can be evaluated within the scope of the parent template or the scope of the nested template. If such a template expression evaluates a secure value of the parent template, it is possible to expose this value in the deployment history.

== Why is this an issue?

Parameters with the type `securestring` and `secureObject` are designed to pass sensitive data to the resources being deployed. Secure parameters cannot be accessed after the deployment is completed: they can neither be logged nor used as an output.

When used in nested deployments, however, it is possible to embed secure parameters in such a way they can be visible afterward. 

=== What is the potential impact?

If the nested deployment contains a secure parameter in this way, then the value of this parameter may be readable in the deployment history. This can lead to important credentials being leaked to unauthorized accounts.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message
==== Primary Message
Change this code to not use an outer expression evaluation scope in nested templates.

==== Secondary Message
This secure parameter is leaked through the deployment history.

=== Highlighting
==== Primary Highlight
If `properties.expressionEvaluationOptions.scope` is set to an incorrect value, then highlight the `properties.expressionEvaluationOptions.scope` property.

If `properties.expressionEvaluationOptions.scope` or `properties.expressionEvaluationOptions` is not set at all, then highlight `properties` entirely (of the `"Microsoft.Resources/deployments"` resource where it should be set.)

==== Secondary Highlight
Highlight the secure parameter in the nested template that is at risk here.
