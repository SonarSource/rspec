== Why is this an issue?

Moving a large string into a small field will result in data truncation with data lost from the right side of the string.

[source,cobol]
----
01 ALPHA   PIC X(4).
*> ...

    MOVE "Now is the time" TO ALPHA *> Noncompliant. Becomes "Now "

----
01 ALPHA   PIC X(15).
*> ...

    MOVE "Now is the time" TO ALPHA
