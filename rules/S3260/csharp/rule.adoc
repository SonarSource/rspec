== Why is this an issue?

``++private++`` classes and records aren't visible outside of their assemblies anyway, so if they're not extended inside the assemblies, they should be made explicitly non-extensible with the addition of the ``++sealed++`` keyword.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
private class MyClass  // Noncompliant
{
  // ...
}

private record MyRecord  // Noncompliant
{
  // ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
private sealed class MyClass
{
  // ...
}

private sealed record MyRecord
{
  // ...
}
----
