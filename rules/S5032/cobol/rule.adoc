== Why is this an issue?

Using recursion with paragraphs is not a problem in itself but it potentially exposes the software to endless loop. This is the case when there is no condition to end the recursion or when this condition is always false.


This rule raises an issue when a paragraph contains a ``++PERFORM++`` to itself to warn the developer that there is a risk of endless loop. This rule can also be used to fully prevent recursion to be used.
