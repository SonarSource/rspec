When the equality operator '==' is unexpectedly used in place of the assignment operator '=', this leads to execute a useless condition expression and to not do the expected assignment.


By default, clang compiler for instance generates a warning in such case but doesn't fail the build.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
a == 4;    //noncompliant
...
for( a == 0; a < 10; a++){  //noncompliant
 ...
}
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
a = 4;  
...
for( a = 0; a < 10; a++){
 ...
}
