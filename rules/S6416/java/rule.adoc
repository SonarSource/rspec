It's common for methods to check the value of their parameters and throw an `IllegalArgumentException`
when one of them doesn't match a given condition.
Those conditions are usually mentioned in the javadoc of the method.

This rule raises an issue when it detects that a method call has an argument which will trigger an `IllegalArgumentException`.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,java]
----
  private void addFirst(Collection<String> collection, String element) {
    if (collection instanceof List) {
      ((List<String>) collection).add(0, element);
    } else {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
  }

  public void caller() {
    // Noncompliant: triggers an IllegalArgumentException because HashSet doesn't implement List
    addFirst(new HashSet<>(), "hello");
  }
