<p>Labeled blocks are useful to help maintainers match-up the beginning and ending of each section of code, especially when that code is badly indented. However, if used, those labels must appear on the same line as the "END" keyword in order to avoid confusion. Otherwise, the label might be misread by maintainers as a procedure call.</p>

<p>\[~ann.campbell.2] The noncompliant <code>foo;</code> can be seen as a <code>foo</code> procedure call. However, it actually is the label of the previous <code>BEGIN .. END</code> block, because the <code>END</code> was not terminated by a semicolon.</p>

<p>Make a suggestion [~ann.campbell.2] - i think the title could be something like <code>Block "END" and semicolon ";" should be on the same line</code></p>
