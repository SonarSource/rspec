== Why is this an issue?

Websphere, Tomcat, and JBoss web servers allow the definition of role-based access to servlets. It may not be granular enough for your purposes, but it's a start, and should be used at least as a base.


This rule raises an issue when a _web.xml_ file has no ``++<security-constraint>++`` elements.
