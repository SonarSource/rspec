This rule raises an issue when a blank import (using `import _ "package"`) is not accompanied by a comment explaining its purpose.

== Why is this an issue?

Blank imports in Go are used to import packages purely for their side effects, such as package initialization or registration of handlers. While sometimes necessary, they make dependencies less explicit and can lead to confusion about why a package is being imported.

When a blank import appears without documentation, it creates several problems:

* **Reduced code clarity**: Other developers cannot easily understand why the package is imported
* **Maintenance difficulties**: It becomes harder to determine if the import is still needed during refactoring
* **Unexpected behavior**: The side effects of the imported package may not be obvious, leading to surprising runtime behavior

Blank imports are commonly used for legitimate purposes like registering image decoders, database drivers, or plugins. However, without proper documentation, these imports become a source of confusion rather than clarity.

=== What is the potential impact?

Undocumented blank imports reduce code maintainability and can lead to confusion during development and maintenance. While not a security issue, they make the codebase harder to understand and modify safely.

== How to fix it

Add a comment above or on the same line as the blank import to explain why it's needed. The comment should clearly state what side effect the import provides.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
package main

import (
    "image"
    _ "image/png"     // Noncompliant
    _ "image/jpeg"    // Noncompliant
    _ "some/package"  // Noncompliant
)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
package main

import (
    "image"
    // Import for PNG decoder registration
    _ "image/png"
    // Import for JPEG decoder registration  
    _ "image/jpeg"
    // Import for custom initialization
    _ "some/package"
)
