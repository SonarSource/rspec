This rule raises an issue when a function call that returns an error as one of its return values has that error ignored or not properly handled.

== Why is this an issue?

Go uses explicit error handling as a core language feature. When you call a function that returns an error, that error represents a potential failure condition that your code should address.

Ignoring errors can lead to several problems:

* *Silent failures*: Operations may fail without any indication, making your program behave unpredictably
* *Difficult debugging*: When something goes wrong later in your program, you won't know which operation actually failed
* *Cascading failures*: If an early operation fails but you continue as if it succeeded, subsequent operations may fail in confusing ways
* *Resource leaks*: Failed operations might leave resources in an inconsistent state

Go's philosophy is that errors are values and should be handled explicitly. The language makes it easy to check and handle errors at each step, allowing you to build robust programs that fail gracefully and provide clear feedback when things go wrong.

=== What is the potential impact?

Ignoring errors can lead to unpredictable program behavior, silent failures, and difficult-to-debug issues. In critical systems, unhandled errors might cause data corruption, resource leaks, or system instability.

== How to fix it

Check the error return value and handle it appropriately. You can return the error to the caller, log it, or take corrective action based on your program's needs.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
func resetInterface(iface string) {
    setLinkDown(iface)  // Noncompliant: error ignored
    setLinkUp(iface)    // Noncompliant: error ignored
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
func resetInterface(iface string) error {
    if err := setLinkDown(iface); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to set link down: %w", err)
    }
    if err := setLinkUp(iface); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to set link up: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
