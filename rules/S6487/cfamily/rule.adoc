== Why is this an issue?

`std::format` takes as an argument a format string that contains replacement fields (surrounded with `{}`)
and a set of extra arguments that will be formatted inside the replacement fields. 
Even if the format string is checked at compile-time, it is possible to have a mismatch between the format string and the arguments. For example, when:

* The format string contains fewer replacement fields than the number of extra arguments:
  `std::format("{} {}", 1, 2, 3);`
* The format string uses indexes for the replacement fields, but one index is missing:
  `std::format("{0} {0} {2}", 1, 2, 3);`

In these cases, the extra arguments are silently ignored. In the best-case scenario, it leads to dead code.
Otherwise, it is a typo, and the output will not be intended.

This rule raises an issue when an unused argument comes from a complex expression, for instance, a function call. Also, when there is a combination of numbered replacement fields, a missing index, and a repeated index.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << std::format("{} {}", 1, 2, sqrt(2)); // Noncompliant
std::cout << std::format("{0} {0} {2}", 1, 2, 3); // Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution
[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << std::format("{} {} {}", 1, 2, sqrt(2)); // Compliant
std::cout << std::format("{0} {0} {2} {1}", 1, 2, 3); // Compliant
