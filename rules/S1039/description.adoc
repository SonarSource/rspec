An empty ``++throw++`` re-throws the temporary object that represents the exception being processed. It is intended to allow partially handling an exception at some level in the call stack (for instance, logging an issue) but then forwarding it to a higher level where it will be fully handled.


However, syntactically, there is nothing to prevent ``++throw;++`` being used outside a catch handler, where there might be no exception object to re-throw. In such a case, the program would call ``++std::terminate++``, which is probably not the expected behavior.
