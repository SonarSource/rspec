== Why is this an issue?

Catch blocks define how to deal with exceptions. It is possible to partially handle an exception before passing it on to a higher level for complete handling with the empty throw statement `throw;`.

However, when an empty throw is called outside of a catch clause, and there is no exception object to re-throw, the program will call `std::terminate`. This will cause the program to end, which is unlikely to be the expected behavior.

== How to fix it

The rule raises an issue when an empty throw expression is used outside of a catch clause.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  throw;   // Noncompliant: it will call std::terminate() if f1 is called while no exception is active
}

void g() {
  try {
    f();
    throw; // Noncompliant
  } catch (...) {
    doSomething();
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  try {
    throw(42);
  } catch (int i) { // The catch block handles partially the int exception
    if (i > 0) {
      throw; // And passes control to the next exception handler
    }
  }
}

void g() noexcept {
  try {
    f();
  } catch (...) {
    // The catch block handles the re-throw from f
    doSomething();
  }
}
----
