While exceptions are a common feature of modern languages, there are several reasons to potentially avoid them:

* They make the control flow of a program difficult to understand, because they introduce additional exit points.
* The use of exceptions in new code can make that code difficult to integrate with existing, non-exception-safe code. 
* They add to the size of each binary produced, thereby increasing both compile time and final executable size.
* They may incur a small performance penalty.
* The time required to handle an exception is not easy to assess, which makes them difficult to use for hard real-time applications. 

This rule raises an issue when: 

* an exception is ``++throw++``n
* a ``++try++``-``++catch++`` block is used
* an exception specification (``++throw(xxx)++``) is present.


== Noncompliant Code Example

This {cpp} code example also applies to Objective-C.

----
double myfunction(char param) throw (int); // Noncompliant
void f {
  try // Noncompliant
  {
    do_something();
    throw 1; // Noncompliant
  }
  catch (...)
  {
    // handle exception
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
double myfunction(char param) noexcept;
bool f {
  if (!do_something()); {
    // Handle the situation
    return false;
  }
  // Rest of the code
  return true;
}
----


== Exceptions

``++noexcept++`` specifications are ignored, because even if you choose not to use exceptions in your code, it's important to decorate as ``++noexcept++`` certain functions (for instance, move constructors that do not ``++throw++``). This decoration can be detected by type traits, and some meta-programming techniques rely on this information.
