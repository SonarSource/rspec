When accessing files on the local filesystem, PHP can enforce security checks to
defend against some attacks. For that purpose, the `open_basedir` setting in the
main PHP configuration should define a root directory from which files are
allowed to be accessed.

== Why is this an issue?

When this configuration is not set, or set to a dangerous value, any file of the
filesystem can be accessed by PHP applications.

=== What is the potential impact?

While deactivating the `open_basedir` setting does not pose a direct threat to
the application's security, it can make the exploitation of other
vulnerabilities easier and more severe.

More precisely, exploiting a path traversal issue in that case will allow
attackers to access any file on the filesystem without additional restrictions
to those applied by the operating system permission checks. This includes
system-critical or otherwise sensitive files.

== How to fix it

The main PHP configuration should define the `open_basedir` setting. Moreover,
this setting should not include overly large directories, such as the root
directory of the filesystem.

Additionally, adding the current directory, noted ".", to the `open_basedir`
configuration is also dangerous. Indeed, it is possible to change the current
directories from PHP scripts with `chdir()`, making the hardening configuration
useless.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
; php.ini
open_basedir="/:${USER}/scripts/data"  ; Noncompliant; root directory in the list
----

[source,php,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
; php.ini
; open_basedir= ; Noncompliant; setting commented out
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
; php.ini
open_basedir="${USER}/scripts/data"
----

[source,php,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
; php.ini try 1
open_basedir="/var/www/myapp/data"
----

@Ann actually I just realised that comment in the php.ini file are defined as the following: "any text on a line after an unquoted semicolon (; ) is ignored" from documentation: see \http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php.

So shall we update the code snippet or not (for readability)? 


Otherwise LGTM!

I've made an update just now. Double-check it?
