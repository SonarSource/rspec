Chaining list(s) to a list literal via https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-core/List/addAll.html[`List<E>.addAll`] should be replaced by a literal with the https://dart.dev/language/operators#spread-operators[spread operator] (`...`).

== Why is this an issue?

Chaining list(s) to a list literal via `addAll`, e.g. `[42]..addAll(l1)..addAll(l1);`, is both less efficient and less verbose than using a list literal with the spread operator: `[42, ...l1, ...l1]`.

* `addAll` chains can be less efficient because each `addAll` call is treated as a separate method call, resulting in unnecessary invocations and allocations, when the goal is to build a single list with all the items provided as arguments 
* `addAll` chains are generally more verbose and less clear because spreading a list can be done via dedicate syntax (`...`) which is closer to natural language

The rule also applies when the chained list is a https://dart.dev/language/operators#conditional-expressions[conditional expression], because the spread operator can be applied conditionally:

[source,dart]
----
[42]..addAll(i1 == i2 ? [43, 44] : []); // Noncompliant
[42, if (i1 == i2) ...[43, 44]];        // Compliant
----

=== Exceptions

The rule doesn't apply when the list chained is a literal, because S7089 already covers this case.

[source,dart]
----
[]..addAll([42]); // Not applicable
----

The rule doesn't cover https://dart.dev/language/collections#control-flow-operators[if and for collections] either, for the same reason (S7089 covers it).

[source,dart]
----
[42]..addAll([if (i1 == 42) 43, 44]);             // Not applicable
[42]..addAll([for (final i in [1, 2, 3]) i * i]); // Not applicable
----

The rule doesn't apply when the `addAll` is not called via cascade operator, but via standard dereference (`.`):

[source,dart]
----
[].addAll(l1);  // Not applicable
[]..addAll(l1); // Noncompliant
----

== How to fix it

Take advantage of the spread operator and, if needed, of its capacity to be applied conditionally.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
[42]..addAll(aList)..addAll(anotherList);
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
[42, ...aList, ...anotherList];
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
[42]..addAll(i1 == i2 ? [43, 44] : []);
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
[42, if (i1 == i2) ...[43, 44]];
----
