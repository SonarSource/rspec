\[~ann.campbell.2] this rule talks about both lists and strings, but the error message explicitly mentions strings. Also, the rule seems to only check for ``++>0++``, but the message says ``++n++``.

During a LaYC sprint, I removed dummy implementations for the following languages:

* cfamily
* flex

They are not implemented in the corresponding analyzer and there currently are no tickets open in order to do so.
