== Why is this an issue?

Most checks against an `indexOf` value compare it with -1 because 0 is a valid index. Checking against >0 ignores the first element, which is likely a bug.

[source,java]
----
String name = "ishmael";

if (name.indexOf("ish") > 0) { // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
----

Moreover, if the intent is merely to check the inclusion of a value in a `String` or a `List`, consider using the `contains` method instead.

[source,java]
----
String name = "ishmael";

if (name.contains("ish") {
  // ...
}
----

If the intent was really to skip the first element,
comparing with `>=1` will make it clearer.

[source,java]
----
String name = "ishmael";

if (name.indexOf("ish") >= 1) {
  // ...
}
----

This rule raises an issue when an `indexOf` value retrieved either from a `String` or a `List` is tested against `>0`.
