Most checks against an `+indexOf+` value compare it with -1 because 0 is a valid index. Any checks which look for values >0 ignore the first element, which is likely a bug. If the intent is merely to check inclusion of a value in a `+String+` or a `+List+`, consider using the `+contains+` method instead.

This rule raises an issue when an `+indexOf+` value retrieved either from a `+String+` or a `+List+` is tested against `+>0+`.
