``++break++`` and ``++continue++`` are unstructured control flow statements which make code harder to read. Additionally, more recent versions of Python raise a SyntaxError when modules containing ``++break++`` or ``++continue++`` outside of a loop are imported.


Therefore, these statements should not be used outside of loops. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
narg=len(sys.argv)
if narg == 1:
        print('@Usage: input_filename nelements nintervals')
        break

== Compliant Solution

----
if narg == 1:
        print('@Usage: input_filename nelements nintervals')
        sys.exit()
