=== How does this work?

Built-in framework methods should be preferred as these often provide additional security mechanisms. Usually, these built-in methods are engineered for internal page redirections. Thus, they might not solve the reader's use case.

In case the application strictly requires external redirections based on user-controllable data, the following should be done instead:

1. Validating the `authority` part of the URL against a statically defined value (see Pitfalls.)
2. Using an allowlist approach in case the destination URLs are multiple but limited.
3. Adding a customized page to which users are redirected, warning about the imminent action and requiring manual authorization to proceed.
