Open redirection occurs when an application uses user-controllable data to build URLs used during redirects.

An attacker with malicious intent could manipulate a user to browse into a specially crafted URL, such as ``++https://trusted.example.com/redirect?url=evil.com++``, to redirect the victim to their evil domain.

Open redirection is most often used to trick users into browsing to a malicious domain that they believe is safe. As such, attackers commonly use open redirect exploits in mass phishing campaigns.
