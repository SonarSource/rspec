== Why is this an issue?

With the creation of the HTML5 specification, many elements were deprecated, including ``++frame++``, ``++frameset++``, and ``++noframes++``. 


While many of the other deprecations were motivated by a desire to clean up the specification, the ``++frame*++`` elements were deprecated because: 

____
using them damages usability and accessibility

____

Therefore frames should be avoided.
