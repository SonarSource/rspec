The address of an automatic object should not be persisted beyond the object's lifetime.

== Why is this an issue?

An automatic object is an object whose lifetime is automatically managed.
The storage for an automatic object, e.g. a local variable, is allocated at the beginning of the enclosing code block and is deallocated at the end.
This is commonly referred to as "allocated on the stack".

If the address of an automatic object is assigned to another automatic object of larger scope, a static or extern object, or if it is returned from a function (using `return` or an output parameter), then there will be a point where the address will point to an object that ceased to exist.
In that case, the address becomes invalid, and attempts to dereference the invalid address -- trying to access the object that ceased to exist -- result in undefined behavior.

[source,cpp]
----
int *global = nullptr;

int* bar(int **out) {
  int local = 42;
  int *ptr;
  global = &local; // Noncompliant: assigning the address of an object allocated on the stack to a global variable
  {
    int i = 9001;
    ptr = &i; // Noncompliant: assigning the address of a stack-allocated object to an object that outlives it
  }
  *out = &local; // Noncompliant: returning the address of an object allocated on the stack (via output parameter)
  return &local; // Noncompliant: returning the address of an object allocated on the stack
}
----


== What is the potential impact?

Persisting addresses of objects with automatic storage past their lifetime is dangerous as it creates invalid addresses.
Attempts to access objects that no longer exist through such invalid addresses result in undefined behavior.

For programs that exercise undefined behavior, the compiler is no longer bound by the language specification.
The application may crash or, even worse, the application may appear to execute correctly while losing data or producing incorrect results.


== How to fix it

There are multiple approaches to avoid persisting addresses of objects with automatic storage after their lifetime ended:

* Make a full copy of the object instead of using its address.
* Allocate the object on the heap (free-store) and deallocate it once done.
* Create the automatic object in a larger scope where it outlives all accesses through its address.
* Reduce the scope of objects that store the address of the original automatic object.

==== Noncompliant code example

----
int* bar(void) {
  int local_auto = 42;
  return &local_auto; // Noncompliant: returns the address of a stack-allocated object
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int foo() {
  int local_auto = 42;
  return local_auto; // Compliant: returns a value rather than an address
}
----

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int* foo() {
  int *local_auto = new int(42);

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
