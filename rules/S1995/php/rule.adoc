== Why is this an issue?

Byte-order marks indicate the endian-ness of 16-bit characters. Their presence in a web page can cause display problems, extra blank lines and even "Headers already sent" errors. When present, a BOM was probably added by the text editor used to modify the file, and should be removed either by re-editing the file with corrected settings or removed manually via a script.
