=== How to fix it in Boto3 DynamoDB

The following code is vulnerable to NoSQL injection because untrusted data is
concatenated to the `FilterExpression` value. This expression determines which items within
the results should be returned.

A malicious HTTP request containing the following
query parameter values `username=admin&password=size(password) or
size(password)=size(password)` would allow an attacker to manipulate the returned data and bypass authentication.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@app.route('/login')
def login():
    dynamodb = AWS_SESSION.client('dynamodb')
    
    username = request.args["username"]
    password = request.args["password"]

    dynamodb.scan(
        FilterExpression= "username = " + username + " and password = " + password,
        TableName="users",
        ProjectionExpression="username"
    ) # Noncompliant

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@app.route('/login')
def login():
    dynamodb = AWS_SESSION.client('dynamodb')
    
    username = request.args["username"]
    password = request.args["password"]

    dynamodb.query(
        KeyConditionExpression= "username = :u",
        FilterExpression= "password = :p",
        ExpressionAttributeValues={
            ":u": { 'S': username },
            ":p": { 'S': password }
        },
        TableName="users",
        ProjectionExpression="username"
    )

=== How does this work?

As a rule of thumb, the approach to protect against injection vulnerabilities
is to ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of the initially intended
logic.  

When using DynamoDB with Boto3, the best way to do so is by using the
expression placeholders (`:placeholder`) which take the value defined in
`ExpressionAttributeValues`, as seen in the compliant solution above.  

When possible, using the method
`query` over `scan` optimizes speed, costs and reduces the attack surface; for
example, in case an injection occurs in `KeyConditionExpression`, the operator `OR` is
disallowed.  

This logic applies both when using the Client and the Resource class, though
the syntax differs for the latter, and the `ExpressionAttributeValues` would look
like the following:

[source,python]
----
ExpressionAttributeValues={
    ":u": username,
    ":p": password
}
----

Although injection can occur on all the query or scan `Expression` attributes,
its most severe impact occurs in the `FilterExpression`.  **Note:** Do not use the
