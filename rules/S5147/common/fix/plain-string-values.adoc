==== Use only plain string values 

With MongoDB, NoSQL injection can arise when attackers are able to inject objects in the query instead of plain string values. For example, using the object `{ $ne: "" }` in a field of a `find` query, will return every entries where the field is not empty.

Some JavaScript applicative web servers enable "extended" syntax that serializes url query parameters into JavaScript objects or arrays. This is allow attacker to control all the fileds of an object.
In express.js, this "extended" syntax https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.urlencoded[is enabled by default].

Before using any untrusted value in a MongoDB query, make sure it is a plain string and not JavaScript objects or arrays.

In some cases, this will not be enough to protect against all attacks and strict validation needs to be applied (see the "Pitfalls" section)
