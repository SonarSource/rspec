==== Pre-approved list

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protect against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of the initially
intended logic.

For NoSQL injections, the cleanest way to do so is to validate the input before
using it in a query.

Create a list of authorized and secure strings that you want the application to
be able to use in a query. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.

The list can be either a regex string, an array, or validators on specific
ranges of characters. If you use regexes, choose simple regexes to avoid ReDOS
attacks.

*Important note*: The application must do validation on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
