==== Operators are to be classified as dangerous

Because these operators run JavaScript, restrict the use of dangerous operators
and functions in both untrusted input and internal code, such as:

* `$where`
* `$function`
* `$accumulator`
* `mapReduce`

Depending on your use case, you should first try all the ways to use regular
API calls before using any of these operators. +
For example, using a `$where` operator is unnecessarily complex when only a simple search is
required. It also leads to performance problems.

**Note**: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/where/#javascript-enablement[Server-side scripting can be disabled].

Regular operators can also lead to data leaks. +
If no operators are needed, you should generally reject user input containing
them. If some operators are necessary, you should restrict their use.
