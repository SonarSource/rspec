==== Use safe builder patterns

Generally, database queries also accept builder patterns to build queries. This
is a safe way to build queries as it ensures that the query is built correctly
and is safe from injection attacks because it does not require you to ensure
that the query is built correctly.

For example, using a `.where()` function instead of a string and `$where` will
help avoid an injection attack.
