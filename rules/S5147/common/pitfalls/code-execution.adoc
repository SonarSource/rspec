==== Code execution

When untrusted data are used within query operators such as `$where`, `$accumulator` or `$function` it usually results in JavaScript code execution vulnerabilities.

Therefore, untrusted values should not be used inside these query operators unless they are validated against a whitelist.

For more information about MongoDB code execution vulnerabilities, see rule S5334.
