User-provided data such as URL parameters, POST body-content should always be considered untrusted and tainted.

Applications that perform NoSQL operations based on tainted data can be
exploited similarly to regular SQL injection bugs.
Depending on the code, the same risks apply: The attacker aims to access
sensitive information or compromise data integrity. To achieve this, the
attacks may involve the misuse of query operators, JavaScript code, or simple
string operations.

This problem can be mitigated by using an Object Document Mapper (ODM) library
or by validating user-supplied data based on its size or allowable characters.
