User-provided data such as URL parameters, POST body-content should always be considered untrusted and tainted.

Applications that perform NoSQL operations based on tainted data can be
exploited similarly to regular SQL injection bugs.
Depending on the code, the same risks exist as with SQL injections: The attacker
aims to access sensitive information or compromise data integrity. The
attacks may involve the injection of query operators, JavaScript code, or
string operations.

This problem can be mitigated by using an Object Document Mapper (ODM) library
or by validating user-supplied data based on its size or allowed characters.
