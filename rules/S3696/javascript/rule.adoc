It is a bad practice to ``++throw++`` something that's not derived at some level from ``++Error++``. If you can't find an existing ``++Error++`` type that suitably conveys what you need to convey, then you should extend ``++Error++`` to create one.


Specifically, part of the point of throwing ``++Error++``s is to communicate about the conditions of the error, but literals have far less ability to communicate meaningfully than ``++Error++``s because they don't include stacktraces.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
throw 404;                              // Noncompliant
throw "Invalid negative index.";        // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
throw new Error("Status: " + 404);
throw new Error("Invalid negative index.");{code}
----
