== Why is this an issue?

It is a well-established convention to name each logger after its enclosing type. This rule raises an issue when the convention is not respected.

include::{language}/why-code-example.adoc[]

Not following such a convention can result in confusion and logging misconfiguration. 

For example, the person configuring the log may attempt to change the logging behavior for the `MyNamespace.EnclosingType` type, by overriding defaults for the logger named after that type.

[source,json]
----
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Error",
            "MyNamespace.EnclosingType": "Debug"
        }
    }
}
----

However, if the convention is not in place, the override would not affect logs from `MyNamespace.EnclosingType`, since they are made via a logger with a different name.

Moreover, using the same logger name for multiple types prevents the granular configuration of each type's logger, since there is no way to distinguish them in configuration.

The rule targets the following logging frameworks:

* https://logging.apache.org/log4net/[Apache log4net]
* https://nlog-project.org/[NLog]

=== Exceptions

The rule doesn't raise issues when custom handling of logging names is in place, and the logger name is not derived from a `Type`.
