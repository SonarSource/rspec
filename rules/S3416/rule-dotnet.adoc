== Why is this an issue?

It is a well-established convention to name each logger after its enclosing type. This rule raises an issue when the convention is not respected.

Not following such a convention can result in confusion and logging misconfiguration. 

For example, the person configuring the log may attempt to change the logging behavior for the `MyNamespace.EnclosingType` type, by overriding defaults for the logger named after that type.

[source,json]
----
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Error",
            "MyNamespace.EnclosingType": "Debug"
        }
    }
}
----

However, if the convention is not in place, the override would not affect logs from `MyNamespace.EnclosingType`, since they are made via a logger with a different name.

Moreover, using the same logger name for multiple types prevents the granular configuration of each type's logger, since there is no way to distinguish them in configuration.

=== Exceptions

The rule doesn't raise issues when custom handling of logging names is in place, and the logger name is not derived from a `Type`.
