Granting file access to WebViews, particularly through the `file://` scheme, introduces a risk of local file inclusion
vulnerabilities. The severity of this risk depends heavily on the specific settings configured for the WebView.  Overly permissive
settings can allow malicious scripts to access a wide range of local files, potentially exposing sensitive data such as
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or private application data, leading to data breaches and other security
compromises.
