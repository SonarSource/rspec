== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Avoid opening `file://` URLs from external sources in WebView components. If your application accepts arbitrary URLs
from external sources, do not enable this functionality.

On Android, it is recommended to use `androidx.webkit.WebViewAssetLoader` to access files, including assets and resources, via a custom, controllable scheme.

On iOS, it is recommended to use Bundles to access local files, keeping access limited a controlled subset using the `allowingReadAccessTo` parameter of the `loadFileURL` method.
If `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` and `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` are not enabled, it is not possible to access files outside the intended directory.
It is also possible to create a custom scheme to access local files, but this is more complex and might lead to unintended security issues.

For enhanced security, ensure that the options to load `file://` URLs are explicitly set to false.
