@Ann, when discovering this rule it was not obvious for me to understand if there was or not a difference between self:: or static:: prefixes to access static functions of fields. 


If my understanding is correct, there is no difference but obviously it's better to use static:: to prevent any misunderstanding. 


If this is the case, I would associate this rule to the SQALE characteristic Maintainability > Understandability and to the tag pitfal

\[~freddy.mallet] I disagree about SQALE - the point of the rule is that when you use ``++self::++`` you're going to get the superclass' version, not the override - i.e. you won't get what you think you will.
