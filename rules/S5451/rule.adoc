This rule is a strict implementation of a MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) rule. MISRA defines best practices for developing safety-critical software. You can learn more about this rule in the MISRA documents referenced below.

If you are not concerned with MISRA compliance or with safety-critical software, you might consider using rule S853 instead ; it targets the same kind of issue for general-purpose software.

* MISRA C 2004, 10.5 - If the bitwise operators ~ and << are applied to an operand of _underlying type_ unsigned char or unsigned short, the result shall be immediately cast to the _underlying type_ of the operand. 
* MISRA C++ 2008, 5-0-10 - If the bitwise operators ~ and << are applied to an operand with an _underlying type_ of unsigned char or unsigned short, the result shall be immediately cast to the _underlying type_ of the operand.
