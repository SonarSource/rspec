== Why is this an issue?

Declaring a parameter without specifying its data type leaves the compiler to assign the type that seems the most appropriate - whether it's what you need or not. Therefore you should always specify the data type.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vb6]
----
Sub SubComputeArea(Length, TheWidth)
  [. . .]
End Sub

=== Compliant solution

[source,vb6]
----
Sub SubComputeArea(Length As Integer, TheWidth As Integer)
  [. . .]
End Sub
