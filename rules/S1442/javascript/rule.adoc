== Why is this an issue?

``++alert(...)++`` as well as ``++confirm(...)++`` and ``++prompt(...)++`` can be useful for debugging during development, but in production mode this kind of pop-up could expose sensitive information to attackers, and should never be displayed.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
if(unexpectedCondition) {
  alert("Unexpected Condition");
}
----
