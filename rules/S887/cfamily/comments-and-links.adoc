MISRA C 2004 : The controlling expression of a for statement shall not contain any objects of floating type.

-> controlling expression : possibly multiple variables involved


MISRA {cpp} 2008 : A for loop shall contain a single loop-counter which shall not have floating type.

-> single variable. Description and example are misleading.


MISRA C 2012 : A loop counter shall not have essentially floating type

-> probably a single variable


Strictly speaking the definition of 2004 does not match those of 2008 and 2012.

\[~samuel.mercier] for a message, I would prefer something like: "xxx" is a "type" and should not be used as a loop counter.
