== Why is this an issue?

When using a floating-point loop counter, accumulation of rounding errors may result in a mismatch between the expected and actual number of iterations. This can happen when a loop step that is not a power of the floating-point radix is rounded to a value that can be represented.


Even if a loop with a floating-point loop counter appears to behave correctly on one implementation, it may give a different number of iterations on another implementation.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
uint32_t counter = 0u;
for ( float32_t f = 0.0f; f < 1.0f; f += 0.001f ) // Noncompliant, floating type used as loop counter
{
  ++counter;
}

float32_t f = 0.0f;
while ( f < 1.0f ) // Noncompliant, floating type used as loop counter
{
  f += 0.001f;
}

float32_t f;
for ( uint32_t counter = 0u; counter < 1000u; ++counter ) // Compliant
{
  f = ( float32_t ) counter * 0.001f;
}

float32_t f = read_float32 ( );
uint32_t u32a;
do
{
  u32a = read_u32 ( );
} while ( ( ( float32_t ) u32a - f ) > 10.0f ); // Compliant, f does not change in the loop so cannot be a loop counter

-> controlling expression : possibly multiple variables involved


MISRA {cpp} 2008 : A for loop shall contain a single loop-counter which shall not have floating type.

-> single variable. Description and example are misleading.


MISRA C 2012 : A loop counter shall not have essentially floating type

-> probably a single variable


Strictly speaking the definition of 2004 does not match those of 2008 and 2012.

\[~samuel.mercier] for a message, I would prefer something like: "xxx" is a "type" and should not be used as a loop counter.
