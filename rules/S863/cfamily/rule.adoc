== Why is this an issue?

Floating-point arithmetic has a range of problems associated with it. Some of these can be overcome by using an implementation that conforms to a recognized standard. An example of an appropriate standard is ANSI/IEEE Std 754.


The definition of the floating-point types, in accordance with Rule 3-9-2, provides an opportunity for noting the floating-point standard in use.


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
// IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point 
typedef float float32_t;
----
