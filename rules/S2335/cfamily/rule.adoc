== Why is this an issue?

There is potential for confusion if an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence is immediately followed by other characters. Instead, such sequences shall be terminated by either:

* The start of another escape sequence.
* The end of the character constant or the end of a string literal.

Note that, since {cpp}23, a syntax with delimiters allows writing escape sequences without confusion and should be preferred; see S7040.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
const char *s1 = "\x41g";  // Noncompliant
int c1 = '\141t'; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
const char *s2 = "\x41" "g"; // Compliant - terminated by end of literal
const char *s3 = "\x41\x67"; // Compliant - terminated by another escape
int c2 = '\141\t'; // Compliant - terminated by another escape
----


== Resources

=== External coding guidelines

* MISRA C:2012, 4.1 - Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences shall be terminated

=== Related rules

* S7040 - Escape sequences should use the delimited form (\\u{}, \\o{}, \\x{})
