== Why is this an issue?

When using escape sequences in a string or character literal, the rules that determine the end of the sequence are slightly complex:

* A hexadecimal sequence (`\x45`) ends on the first character that is not a hexadecimal digit.
* An octal sequence (`\123`) ends on a character that is not an octal digit or after 3 digits.

There is potential for confusion if an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence is immediately followed by other characters. Instead, such sequences shall be terminated by either:

* The start of another escape sequence, or
* The end of the character constant or the end of a string literal, or
* Any character that obviously cannot be part of the sequence, like a space, a `[`, any punctuation...


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
const char *s1 = "\x41g";  // Noncompliant
int c1 = '\141t'; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
const char *s2 = "\x41" "g"; // Compliant - terminated by end of literal
const char *s3 = "\x41\x67"; // Compliant - terminated by another escape
int c2 = '\141\t'; // Compliant (with a different value) - terminated by another escape
----
