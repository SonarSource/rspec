== Why is this an issue?

There is potential for confusion if an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence is immediately followed by other characters. Instead, such sequences should be terminated by either:

* The start of another escape sequence.
* The end of the string.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
String hasHex = "\x41g";  // Noncompliant
String hasOct = '\141t'; // Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
String hasHex = "\x41" + "g"; // Compliant - terminated by end of literal
String hasOct = "\x41\x67"; // Compliant - terminated by another escape
----
