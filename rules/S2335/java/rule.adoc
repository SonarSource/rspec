There is potential for confusion if an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence is immediately followed by other characters. Instead, such sequences should be terminated by either:

* The start of another escape sequence.
* The end of the string.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
String hasHex = "\x41g";  // Noncompliant
String hasOct = '\141t'; // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
String hasHex = "\x41" + "g"; // Compliant - terminated by end of literal
String hasOct = "\x41\x67"; // Compliant - terminated by another escape
----
