== Why is this an issue?

include::../common/why-is-this-an-issue.adoc[]

In Dart, the convention is that constant identifier names should be in camel case and start with a lowercase.

=== What is the potential impact?

include::../common/what-is-the-potential-impact.adoc[]

== How to fix it

Update the name of the constant to match the convention (lowerCamelCase), as well as all usages of the name.
For many IDEs, you can use built-in renaming and refactoring features to update all usages of a constant at once.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass {
  const PI = 3.14159; // Noncompliant
  const MY_CONSTANT = 42; // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass {
  const pi = 3.14159;
  const myConstant = 42;
}
