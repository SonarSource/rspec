Constants are variables whose value does not change during the runtime of a
program after initialization.
Oftentimes, constants are used in multiple locations across different
subroutines.

It is important that the names of constants follow a consistent and easily
recognizable pattern.
This way, readers immediately understand that the referenced value does not
change, which simplifies debugging.
