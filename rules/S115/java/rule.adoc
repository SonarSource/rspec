Constants should be named consistently to communicate intent and improve
maintainability.
To fix this issue, rename your constants to follow your project's naming
convention.

== Why is this an issue?

Constants are variables whose value does not change after initialization during
the runtime of a program.
Oftentimes, constants are used in multiple locations across different
subroutines or even source files.

It is important that the names of constants follow a consistent and easily
recognizable pattern, e.g. using only fully capitalized names.
This way, observing any usage of a constant name will immediately communicate
the particular properties of constants to a reader.
For instance, they can be assured that the constant will not change which
simplifies debugging, or in the case of primitive constants, that accessing them
is thread safe.

This rule checks that all constant names match a given regular expression.

=== What is the potential impact?

Applying a consistent naming scheme to constants improves the readability of
code and makes it easier to understand, which will also boost
team collaboration.

Conversely, to forego a naming convention will negatively impact the
overall maintainability of an application.

== How to fix it

First, familiarize yourself with the particular naming convention of the project
in question.
Then, update the name of the constant to match the convention, as well as all
usages of the name.
For many IDEs, you can make use of built-in renaming and refactoring features to
update all usages of a constant at once.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

With the default regular expression ``++^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*(_[A-Z0-9]+)*$++``:

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyClass {
  public static final float pi = 3.14159; // Noncompliant: Constant is not capitalized

  void myMethod() {
    System.out.println(pi);
  }
}

public enum MyEnum {
  optionOne, // Noncompliant
  optionTwo; // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyClass {
  public static final float PI = 3.14159; 

  void myMethod() {
    System.out.println(PI);
  }
}

public enum MyEnum {
  OPTION_ONE,
  OPTION_TWO;
}
----
