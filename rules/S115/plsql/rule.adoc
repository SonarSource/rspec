==== Noncompliant code example

The following example assumes that constant names should match the default
regular expression ``++[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?++``:

[source,sql,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
DECLARE
  constant_ CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 42; -- Noncompliant
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,sql,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
DECLARE
  constant CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 42; -- Compliant
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
