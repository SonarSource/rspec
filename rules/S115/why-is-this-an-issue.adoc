Constants are variables whose value does not change during the runtime of a
program after initialization.
Oftentimes, constants are used in multiple locations across different
subroutines.

It is important that the names of constants follow a consistent and easily
recognizable pattern.
This way, the unique properties of constants are immediately communicated to
the reader when observing any usage of a constant.
For instance, they can be assured that the constant will not change, which
simplifies debugging.
