Constants are variables whose value does not change after initialization during
the runtime of a program.
Oftentimes, constants are used in multiple locations across different
subroutines.

It is important that the names of constants follow a consistent and easily
recognizable pattern.
This way, observing any usage of a constant name will immediately communicate
the particular properties of constants to a reader.
For instance, they can be assured that the constant will not change which
simplifies debugging.
