==== Noncompliant code example

The following example assumes that constant names should match the default
regular expression ``++^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*(_[A-Z0-9]+)*$++``:

[source,vb6,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Global Const WdgtStatusOk = 0
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vb6,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Global Const WDGT_STATUS_OK = 0
----
