== Exceptions

No issue will be created if one of the methods above is called with a hard-coded type/method/field/property/interface/module name. There can be no injection in this specific scenario.

Example:

----
assembly.GetType("MyHardcodedType")
----

No issue will be created if one of the methods is called on an instance of _Type_ created using _GetType_ operator. There can be no injection in this specific scenario.

Example:

----
typeof(CustomType).GetMethods();
