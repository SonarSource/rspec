FYI [~freddy.mallet] I think that the remdiation cost of this should be fairly high, because it will usually force you to redesign your program.

\[~nicolas.peru] I need some help narrowing how this rule should apply to ABAP. It looks like we should flag instances of:

``++GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL++``

``++INSERT REPORT ... FROM ...++``

``++READ REPORT ... INTO ...++``

``++GENERATE REPORT++``

``++GENERATE DYNPRO++``

{empty}...?

Java, C#, VB.NET, Kotlin, Ruby should be in the list of Targeted Languages. I did no check for all of them, but I believe that all modern languages can call compiler API at runtime.

\[~alexandre.gigleux] I added Ruby as it has the ``++eval++`` function. I am open to discussion of course but I wouldn't include compiled language for now as they are rarely used to execute dynamic code. The value of this rule in this context would be probably low compared to its implementation time. The https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Runtime_evaluation#Java[way to do it in java] is so complex that I am not even sure what should be checked, the compilation or the class loading? There would be case where the code is compiled without being loaded, which would then be false positives.
