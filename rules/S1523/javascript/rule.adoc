Executing code dynamically is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9807[CVE-2017-9807]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9802[CVE-2017-9802]

Some APIs enable the execution of dynamic code by providing it as strings at runtime. These APIs might be useful in some very specific meta-programming use-cases. However most of the time their use is frowned upon as they also increase the risk of https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection[Injected Code]. Such attacks can either run on the server or in the client (exemple: XSS attack) and have a huge impact on an application's security.


This rule raises issues on calls to ``++eval++`` and ``++Function++`` constructor. This rule does not detect code injections. It only highlights the use of APIs which should be used sparingly and very carefully. The goal is to guide security code reviews.

The rule also flags string literals starting with ``++javascript:++`` as the code passed in ``++javascript:++`` URLs is evaluated the same way as calls to ``++eval++`` or ``++Function++`` constructor.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
let value = eval('obj.' + propName); // Sensitive
let func = Function('obj' + propName); // Sensitive
location.href = 'javascript:void(0)'; // Sensitive
----

== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue when the argument of the ``++eval++`` or ``++Function++`` is a literal string as it is reasonably safe.
