Executing code dynamically is security sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9807[CVE-2017-9807]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9802[CVE-2017-9802]

Some APIs enable the execution of dynamic code by providing it as strings at runtime. These APIs might be useful in some very specific meta-programming use-cases. However most of the time their use is frowned upon as they also increase the risk of https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection[Injected Code]. Such attacks can either run on the server or in the client (exemple: XSS attack) and have a huge impact on an application's security.


This rule raises an issue when the following commands are used with values concatenated from other tables or use input:

* ``++GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL++``
* ``++GENERATE DYNPRO++``
* ``++GENERATE REPORT++``
* ``++INSERT REPORT ... FROM ...++``
* ``++READ REPORT ... INTO ...++``

This rule does not detect code injections. It only highlights the use of APIs which should be used sparingly and very carefully. The goal is to guide security code reviews.
