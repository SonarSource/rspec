== Why is this an issue?

Copy/Paste from Wikipedia. [~ann.campbell.2] could you adjust ?

A common assumption made by novice programmers is that all variables are set to a known value, such as zero, when they are declared. While this is true for many languages, it is not true for all of them, and so the potential for error is there. Languages such as C use stack space for variables, and the collection of variables allocated for a subroutine is known as a stack frame. While the computer will set aside the appropriate amount of space for the stack frame, it usually does so simply by adjusting the value of the stack pointer, and does not set the memory itself to any new state (typically out of efficiency concerns). Therefore, whatever contents of that memory at the time will appear as initial values of the variables which occupy those addresses.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int a;
int b = a +1; //What's the value of 'a' and so what's the value of 'b' ?
