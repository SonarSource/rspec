I believe that this rule is actually a subset of https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/TSM03-J.+Do+not+publish+partially+initialized+objects[TSM03-J]. Do we have a rule targeting that? Do we want to implement both?


This rule can be implemented on semantic level, however it will catch only simple cases of this. To do this properly we need to do full escape analysis and implement equivalent of  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/TSM03-J.+Do+not+publish+partially+initialized+objects[TSM03-J]

\[~tibor.blenessy] I considered adding that mapping to this rule, but really see it as tangential to the rule as currently described. Let me know if you disagree.
