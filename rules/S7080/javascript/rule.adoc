The Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard that serves as
an additional layer of protection against various types of attacks.

== Why is this an issue?

The Content Security Policy (CSP) helps protect against various types of attacks, 
including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It provides a set of standard
procedures for loading resources by user agents, which can help to mitigate the
risk of content injection vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that CSP is not a primary line of defense, but
rather a safety net that catches attempts to exploit vulnerabilities that exist
in the application despite other protective measures. An insecure CSP does not
automatically imply that the website is vulnerable, but it does mean that this
additional layer of protection is weakened.

A CSP can be considered insecure if it allows potentially harmful practices,
such as inline scripts or loading resources from arbitrary domains. These
practices can increase the risk of content injection attacks.

=== What is the potential impact?

An insecure Content Security Policy (CSP) can increase the potential severity of
other vulnerabilities in the application. For instance, if an attacker manages to
exploit a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, an insecure CSP might not
provide the intended additional protection.

==== Code Execution

XSS can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user without their
consent, such as changing their email address or password, or making
transactions. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential loss of control
over user accounts.

==== Phishing Attacks

Attackers can create convincing phishing pages within the application. 
These pages can trick users into providing sensitive information, believing 
they are interacting with a legitimate part of the application.

==== Data leakage

XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into webviews. These scripts can
then be used to steal sensitive information like session cookies, personal data,
or credit card details, leading to identity theft or financial fraud.

In addition, an insecure CSP that allows loading resources from arbitrary
domains could potentially expose sensitive user data to untrusted sources. This
could lead to data breaches, which can have serious legal and reputational
consequences.

== How to fix it in Electron

CSP's preferred delivery mechanism is an HTTP header. However, if is not possible
(like when loading a resource using the `+file://+` protocol), it is possible to set
a policy of a page directly in the markup using a `+<meta>+` tag.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow()
})
----

[source,html,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>An example</title>
  </head> <!-- Noncompliant -->
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  session.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived((details, callback) => {
    callback({responseHeaders: {
      ...details.responseHeaders,
      'Content-Security-Policy': ['default-src \'self\'; script-src \'self\' https://demo.demo1.org']
    }})
  })
  createWindow()
})
----

[source,html,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
        http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
        content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://demo.demo1.org"
    />
    <title>An example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>

=== How does this work?

Content Security Policy (CSP) can either be enabled in HTML code with a `+<meta>+`
tag or in the Javascript code of the Electron application by declaring a `+onHeadersReceived()+`
handler. When loading a resource using the `+file://+` protocol, the CSP has to be
set using a `+<meta>+` tag.

CSP should adhere to the  principle of least privilege. This principle states
that an application should be given
the minimum levels of access necessary to complete its tasks. In the context
of CSP, this means restricting the sources from which content can be loaded to
the minimum necessary.

Here are some steps to secure your CSP:

* Avoid 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval': These settings allow inline scripts
and script evaluation, which can open the door for executing malicious scripts.
Instead, use script hashes, nonces, or strict dynamic scripting if scripts must
be used.
* Specify exact sources: Rather than using a wildcard (*) which allows any domain,
specify the exact domains from which resources can be loaded. This reduces the
risk of loading resources from potentially malicious sources.
* Use 'self' cautiously: While 'self' is safer than a wildcard, it can still lead
to vulnerabilities if your own site has been compromised or hosts user-uploaded
content. Be sure to validate and sanitize all user content.
