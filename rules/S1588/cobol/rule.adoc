== Why is this an issue?

The ``++PROGRAM-ID++`` declaration at the top of a program must exactly match the filename of the program. If these do not match, functions like ``++CANCEL++`` may not be able to cancel the program, leaving it resident in memory. Debugging can also be affected because program breakpoints may not match the program name.
