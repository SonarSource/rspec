== Why is this an issue?

Visual Basic .NET offers a non-short-circuit conditional function, ``++IIf()++``, which returns either its second or third parameter based on the expression in the first parameter. Using it is slower than using ``++If()++`` because each parameter is unconditionally evaluated. Further, its use can lead to runtime exceptions because ``++IIf++`` always evaluates all three of its arguments. 


The newer version, ``++If()++``, should be used instead because it short-circuits the evaluation of its parameters.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Public Class Foo
    Public Sub Bar() 
        Dim var As Object = IIf(Date.Now.Year = 1999, "Lets party!", "Lets party like it is 1999!") ' Noncompliant
    End Sub 
End Class 
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Public Class Foo 
    Public Sub Bar() 
        Dim var As String = If(Date.Now.Year = 1999, "Lets party!", "Lets party like it is 1999!") 
    End Sub 
End Class
