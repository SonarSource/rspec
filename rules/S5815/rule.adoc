In C, a string is just a buffer of characters, normally using the `+null+` character as a sentinel for the end of the string. This means that the developer has to be aware of low-level details such as buffer sizes or having an extra character to store the final `+null+` character. Doing that correctly and consistently is notoriously difficult and any error can lead to a security vulnerability, for instance, giving access to sensitive data or allowing arbitrary code execution.

The function `+char *strncat( char *restrict dest, const char *restrict src, size_t count );+` appends the characters of string `+src+` at the end of `+dest+`, but only add `+count+` characters max. `+dest+` will always be `+null+`-terminated. The `+wcsncat+` does the same for wide characters, and should be used with the same guidelines.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* There is a possibility that either the `+src+` or the `+dest+` pointer is `+null+`
* The current string length of `+dest+` plus the current string length of `+src+` plus 1 (for the final `+null+` character) is larger than the size of the buffer pointer-to by `+src+`
* There is a possibility that either string is not correctly `+null+`-terminated

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* C11 provides, in its annex K, the `+strncat_s+` and the `+wcsncat_s+` that were designed as safer alternatives to `+strncat+` and `+wcsncat+`. It's not recommended to use them in all circumstances because they introduce a runtime overhead and require to write more code for error handling, but they perform checks that will limit the consequences of calling the function with bad arguments.
* Even if your compiler does not exactly support annex K, you probably have access to similar functions
* If you are using `+strncat+` and `+wsncat+` as a safer version of `+strcat+` and `+wcscat+`, you should instead consider `+strcat_s+` and `+wcscat_s+` because these functions have several shortcomings:
** It's not easy to detect truncation
** The `+count+` parameter is error-prone
** Computing the `+count+` parameter typically requires computing the string length of `+dest+`, at which point other simpler alternatives exist


== Sensitive Code Example

----
int f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strcpy(dest, "Result: ");
  strncat(dest, src, sizeof dest); // Sensitive: passing the buffer size instead of the remaining size
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int f(char *src) {
  char result[] = "Result: ";
  char dest[256];
  strcpy(dest, result);
  strncat(dest, src, sizeof dest - sizeof result); // Compliant but may silently truncate
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----
