In C, a string is just a buffer of characters, normally using the ``++null++`` character as a sentinel for the end of the string. This means that the developer has to be aware of low-level details such as buffer sizes or having an extra character to store the final ``++null++`` character. Doing that correctly and consistently is notoriously difficult and any error can lead to a security vulnerability, for instance, giving access to sensitive data or allowing arbitrary code execution.


The function ``++char *strncat( char *restrict dest, const char *restrict src, size_t count );++`` appends the characters of string ``++src++`` at the end of ``++dest++``, but only add ``++count++`` characters max. ``++dest++`` will always be ``++null++``-terminated. The ``++wcsncat++`` does the same for wide characters, and should be used with the same guidelines.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* There is a possibility that either the ``++src++`` or the ``++dest++`` pointer is ``++null++``
* The current string length of ``++dest++`` plus the current string length of ``++src++`` plus 1 (for the final ``++null++`` character) is larger than the size of the buffer pointer-to by ``++src++``
* There is a possibility that either string is not correctly ``++null++``-terminated

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* C11 provides, in its annex K, the ``++strncat_s++`` and the ``++wcsncat_s++`` that were designed as safer alternatives to ``++strncat++`` and ``++wcsncat++``. It's not recommended to use them in all circumstances because they introduce a runtime overhead and require to write more code for error handling, but they perform checks that will limit the consequences of calling the function with bad arguments.
* Even if your compiler does not exactly support annex K, you probably have access to similar functions
* If you are using ``++strncat++`` and ``++wsncat++`` as a safer version of ``++strcat++`` and ``++wcscat++``, you should instead consider ``++strcat_s++`` and ``++wcscat_s++`` because these functions have several shortcomings:
** It's not easy to detect truncation
** The ``++count++`` parameter is error-prone
** Computing the ``++count++`` parameter typically requires computing the string length of ``++dest++``, at which point other simpler alternatives exist


== Sensitive Code Example

----
int f(char *src) {
  char dest[256];
  strcpy(dest, "Result: ");
  strncat(dest, src, sizeof dest); // Sensitive: passing the buffer size instead of the remaining size
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
int f(char *src) {
  char result[] = "Result: ";
  char dest[256];
  strcpy(dest, result);
  strncat(dest, src, sizeof dest - sizeof result); // Compliant but may silently truncate
  return doSomethingWith(dest);
}
----
