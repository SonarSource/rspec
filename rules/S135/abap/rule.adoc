Restricting the number of ``++CONTINUE++``, ``++EXIT++`` and ``++CHECK++`` statements in a loop is done in the interest of good structured programming.


One ``++CONTINUE++``, ``++EXIT++`` and ``++CHECK++`` statement is acceptable in a loop, since it facilitates optimal coding. If there is more than one, the code should be refactored to increase readability.
