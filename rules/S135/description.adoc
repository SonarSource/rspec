The use of `break` and `continue` statements increases the complexity of the control flow and makes it harder to understand the program logic.
In order to keep a good program structure, they should not be applied more than once per loop.

This rule reports an issue when there is more than one `break` or `continue` statement in a loop.
The code should be refactored to increase readability if there is more than one.
