\[~jeanchristophe.collet] I would suggest underlining the exception class name because we cannot always underline the access modifier. Consider a scenario where the exception class has a public modifier, but is a inner class of a partial internal class:

----
partial class MyClass
{
    public class MyException : Exception
    {
    }
}
----

{empty}...in another file...

----
internal partial class MyClass
{

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb264484.aspx If I read that correctly the rule should only be raised when an exception directly derived from System.Exception, System.SystemException, or System.ApplicationException is not public.

If it is indirectly derived, then issue is not raised.

As it is now, we're doing the opposite, aren't we?

My initial update omitted the "not" [~jeanchristophe.collet]. That's fixed now.
