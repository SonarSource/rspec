The point of having custom exception types is to convey more information than is available in standard types. But custom exception types must be ``++public++`` for that to work. 


If a method throws a non-public exception, the best you can do on the caller's side is to ``++catch++`` the closest ``++public++`` base of the class. That is, you lose all that custom information you created the exception type to pass. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
internal class MyException : Exception   // Noncompliant
{
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
public class MyException : Exception
{
  // ...
}
----


== Exceptions

This rule ignores Exception types that are not derived directly from ``++System.Exception++``, ``++System.SystemException++``, or ``++System.ApplicationException++``.
