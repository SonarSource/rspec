This rule raises an issue when an exception constructor is called without being thrown, typically in catch blocks or error handling code.

== Why is this an issue?

Creating an exception object without throwing it is almost always a programming error. When you construct an exception, you typically intend to throw it to signal an error condition.

This pattern commonly occurs when developers forget to include the `throw` keyword before the exception constructor. Without `throw`, the exception object is created but immediately discarded, meaning:

* The error condition is not properly signaled
* The calling code continues executing as if nothing went wrong
* The original problem remains hidden, making debugging difficult
* Error handling logic is effectively bypassed

This is particularly problematic in catch blocks where the usual intent is to wrap the caught exception in a more specific exception type and re-throw it. When the `throw` keyword is missing, the catch block silently swallows the error instead of propagating it.

=== What is the potential impact?

Silent failures can occur where errors are not properly reported or handled. This makes debugging extremely difficult and can lead to data corruption or unexpected application behavior. Critical error conditions may go unnoticed in production systems.

== How to fix it

Add the missing `throw` keyword before the exception constructor to properly throw the exception.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
try {
    doStuff()
} catch(Exception e) {
    new ServiceException(e) // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
try {
    doStuff()
} catch(Exception e) {
    throw new ServiceException(e)
}
