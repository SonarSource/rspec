== Why is this an issue?

The ``++exit(...)++`` and ``++die(...)++`` statements should absolutely not be used in Web PHP pages as this might lead to a very bad user experience. In such case, the end user might have the feeling that the web site is down or has encountered a fatal error. 


But of course PHP can also be used to develop command line application and in such case use of ``++exit(...)++`` or ``++die(...)++`` statement can be justified but must remain limited and not spread all over the application. We expect exceptions to be used to handle errors and those exceptions should be caught just before leaving the application to specify the exit code with help of ``++exit(...)++`` or ``++die(...)++`` statements.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
class Foo {
    public function bar($param)  {
        if ($param === 42) {
            exit(23);
        }
    }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
class Foo {
    public function bar($param)  {
        if ($param === 42) {
            throw new Exception('Value 42 is not expected.');
        }
    }
}
