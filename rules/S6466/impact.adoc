=== What is the potential impact?

Issues of this type interrupt the normal execution of a program, causing it to
crash or putting it into an inconsistent state.
Therefore, this issue might impact the availability and reliability of your
application, or even result in data loss.

If the computation of an index value is tied to user input data, this issue can
potentially even be exploited by attackers to disrupt your application.
