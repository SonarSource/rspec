An array index out-of-bounds exception is a bug class that occurs in Java when a program tries to access an array element that does not exist.
This bug can cause a Java program to crash or behave unexpectedly, and it can also lead to security vulnerabilities.
To fix an array index out of bounds exception in Java, you should always ensure that you are accessing array elements within the bounds of the array.


== Why is this an issue?

An array index out-of-bounds exception indicates a bug or a logical error in the
code.

In Java, arrays have a fixed size, and their elements are indexed starting from
`0`, counting up to the last index that is still smaller than the size.
When trying to access an array outside of this range, an
`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown and the operation will fail.

== How can I fix it?

The following are examples of code containing out-of-bounds accesses to
arrays, resulting in `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exceptions.
These situations can be avoided by carefully considering the range of valid
index values, or even better, by comparing indices and the size of a sequence.

In this first example an array `arr` containing three elements is being created.
Since in Java, the first element of a list has index `0`, the last valid index
is `2`.
Therefore, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown when accessing `arr` at
index `3`.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
  void nonCompliant() {
    int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};

    int x = arr[3]; // Noncompliant: Valid indices are 0, 1 and 2
    int y = arr[-1]; // Noncompliant: Negative indices are not supported in Java
  }
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
  void compliant() {
    int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};

    int x = arr[0];
    int y = arr[2];
  }
----

The following example is similar, but we don't know the concrete length of the
array `arr` so we use `array.length` instead.
Still, accessing an array with its size as an index is not correct:

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
  void nonCompliant(int[] arr) {
    System.out.println(arr[arr.length]); // Noncompliant: Indexing starts at 0, hence array.length will always be an invalid index.
  }
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
  void compliant(int[] arr) {
    // We can make sure arr is non-empty before trying to access its last element.
    if (arr.length > 0) {
      System.out.println(arr[arr.length - 1]);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Empty array!");
    }
  }
----

=== How does it work?

You should always ensure that you are accessing arrays using indices that are
within the bounds of the array.
Here are some best practices to follow:

Always compare indices and the length of an array before accessing elements
using `if-else` constructs or other control flow tools.
For this, you can use the `length` property of arrays.
For example, `arr.length` returns the length of the `arr` array.
Also ensure that you are not accessing an array using negative indices.

Use loops to iterate over arrays instead of accessing elements directly.
This can be done using the `for` loop or the `foreach` loop.
For example, `for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++)` iterates over the `myArray` array using an index variable `i` within its bounds.
The same goes for `for (Object o : myArray)`.
If you manipulate the index used to access an array inside the loop, make sure
that the resulting index stays within bounds.

=== Pitfalls

The indices `0`, or `arr.length - 1` for the first and last element of a
sequence are not always valid!
Make sure the array in question is non-empty before accessing these indices.

=== Going the extra mile

In many cases you can eliminate loops containing index accesses altogether by
applying the Java stream API to arrays using `java.util.Arrays.stream()`.
The API provides methods like `map()` or `filter()` that allow you to transform,
filter and perform many different operations on the elements of an array without
using indices.
