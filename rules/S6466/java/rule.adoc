An array index out of bounds exception is a bug class that occurs in Java when a program tries to access an array element that does not exist. This bug can cause a Java program to crash or behave unexpectedly, and it can also lead to security vulnerabilities. To fix an array index out of bounds exception in Java, you should always ensure that you are accessing array elements within the bounds of the array.

== Why is this an issue?

Array index out of bounds exception is a serious problem in Java because it can cause a program to crash or behave unexpectedly. When a Java program tries to access an array element that does not exist, it can cause the program to crash, which can be frustrating for users and can lead to data loss if the program was not saved before the crash. In some cases, the program may not crash but instead behave unexpectedly, such as displaying incorrect data or producing incorrect results. This can be a serious problem, especially if the program is used for critical tasks such as financial transactions or medical records. Therefore, it is important to fix array index out of bounds exception in Java to ensure that programs are reliable, secure, and function as intended.

//== How to fix it in FRAMEWORK NAME

To fix array index out of bounds exception in Java, you should always ensure that you are accessing array elements within the bounds of the array. Here are some best practices to follow:


Always check the length of the array before accessing elements. This can be done using the `length` property of the array. For example, `myArray.length` returns the length of the `myArray` array. This will ensure that you do not try to access elements that do not exist.
Use loops to iterate over arrays instead of accessing elements directly. This can be done using the `for` loop or the `foreach` loop. For example, `for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++)` iterates over the `myArray` array using an index variable `i`. The same goes for `for (Object o : myArray)`. This will ensure that you do not accidentally access elements that do not exist.

Use try-catch blocks to handle array index out of bounds exception. This can be done by wrapping the code that accesses the array element in a `try` block and catching the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in a `catch` block. For example,

[source,java]
----
try {
    int element = myArray[index];
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    // handle the exception
}
----

This will allow you to gracefully handle the exception and prevent the program from crashing.


By following these best practices, you can prevent array index out of bounds exception in Java and ensure that your programs are reliable, secure, and function as intended.


=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,text,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
  void nonCompliant() {
    int[] l = {1, 2, 3};

    int x = l[-1]; // Noncompliant
    int y = l[3]; // Noncompliant
  }
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,text,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
  void compliant() {
    int[] l = {1, 2, 3};

    int x = l[0];
    int y = l[2];
  }
