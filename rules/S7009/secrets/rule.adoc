=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("scaleway-id", "SCWYGX3NJWHM615C0YHI");
props.set("scaleway-key", "2404784b-b2ff-436d-a59b-11922d6034cb"); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("scaleway-id", System.getenv("SCALEWAY_ID"));
props.set("scaleway-key", System.getenv("SCALEWAY_KEY"));
