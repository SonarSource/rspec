Use the matching way of deallocating the objects to the one used to allocate them to avoid segmentation faults and memory leaks.

== Why is this an issue?

The same form that was used to create an object should always be used to delete it.
Specifically, deallocation should correspond to allocation as per the table below.

.Matching allocation and deallocation ways
[options="header"]
|============================================
|Allocation                   | Deallocation
|`p = new T();`               | `delete p;`
|`+p = new T[5];+`            | `+delete[] p;+`
|`p = malloc(sizeof(int)*5);` | `free(p);`
|============================================

=== What is the potential impact?

Using a mismatching deallocation construct leads to undefined behavior.
This means the compiler is not bound by the language standard anymore and your program has no meaning assigned to it.

Practically, you can observe the following effects:

- Deleting a single object with `+delete[]+` leads to a segmentation fault
  trying to access memory-manager metadata that is not there.
- Deleting an array with `delete` leads to a memory leak because it will
  delete and deallocate only the first element of the array.
- Freeing with `free()` the underlying memory for an object constructed with `new`
  will skip the destructor call, most likely leading to a memory leak.
  Additionally, a destructor might still be called on deallocated memory causing further undefined behavior.

=== Why is the issue raised for a type with a trivial destructor?

Automatic constructor and destructor invocation is not the only difference between
the C-style `malloc`/`free` memory allocator, and the {cpp}-style `new`/`delete`.

These two memory allocators use different metadata and different algorithms.
For example, `new` has an array form `+new[]+` that stores an "array cookie".


The following example causes undefined behavior,
even though the destructor has now effect,
because `free()` expects different metadata for the pointer it is passed
than what is arranged by the `new` operator:

[source,cpp]
----
struct TrivialClass {};


TrivialClass* p = new TrivialClass();
free(p); // Noncompliant: no-op destructor is skipped; still undefined behavior
----

In the code below, `+delete[]+` expects to find an array cookie and fails:

[source,cpp]
----
int* p = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
delete[] p; // Noncompliant: expect array cookie
----


If you need allocate memory in a custom `T::operator new(std::size_t)`,
you should use `void* ::operator new(std::size_t)` and not `free()`.

Note that `::operator new` is still not compatible with `free()`:

[source,cpp]
----
auto p = ::operator new(10 * sizeof(int));
free(p); // Noncompliant
----

== How to fix it

Use the deallocation mechanism that matches the allocation.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
std::string* _pString1 = new std::string;
std::string* _pString2 = new std::string[100];
char* _pChar = (char *) malloc(100);

delete [] _pString1; // Noncompliant: an object was declared, but array deletion is attempted
delete _pString2;  // Noncompliant: an array was declared, but an object (the first in the array) is deleted
delete _pChar; // Noncompliant
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
std::string* _pString1 = new std::string;
std::string* _pString2 = new std::string[100];
char* _pChar = (char *) malloc(100);

delete _pString1; // Compliant: delete the object
delete [] _pString2; // Compliant: delete the entire array
free(_pChar); // Compliant: free the memory C-style
----

=== Going the extra mile

include::../../../shared_content/cfamily/memory_raii_extra_mile.adoc[]

This guarantees that the memory managed by such object is automatically deallocated by the destructor,
using the matching form of deallocation.
 

[source,cpp]
----
std::string _pString1a; // A local variable, that manages heap memory

// Use a smart pointer when you do need heap allocation
auto _pString1b = std::make_unique<std::string>();

std::vector<std::string> _pString2(100);
std::string _pChar{100, '\0'};

// No need to call "delete" or "free".
// Memory allocated for the three objects above will be freed automatically
// when they go out of scope.
