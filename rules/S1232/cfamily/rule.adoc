== Why is this an issue?

The same form that was used to create an object should always be used to delete it. Specifically, arrays should be deleted with ``++delete []++`` and objects should be deleted with ``++delete++``. To do otherwise will cause segfaults (in the case of deleting an object with ``++delete []++``) and memory leaks (in the case of deleting an array with ``++delete++``).

This is also true when memory was allocated with ``++malloc++``, or one of its variants, then it must be released using ``++free()++`` not ``++delete++``. Similarly memory allocated by ``++new++`` can not be released using ``++free++`` instead of ``++delete++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
string* _pString1 = new string;
string* _pString2 = new string[100];
char* _pChar = (char *) malloc(100);

delete [] _pString1; // Noncompliant; an object was declared but array deletion is attempted
delete _pString2;  // Noncompliant; an array was declared but an object (the first in the array) is deleted
delete _pChar; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
string* _pString1 = new string;
string* _pString2 = new string[100];
char* _pChar = (char *) malloc(100);

delete _pString1;
delete [] _pString2; 
free(_pChar);
