Calling https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-core/Iterable/toList.html[`toList`] on an https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-core/Iterable/Iterable.html[`Iterable`] used in a list literal with a https://dart.dev/language/collections#spread-operators[spread operator] is redundant and should be removed.

== Why is this an issue?

The https://dart.dev/language/collections#spread-operators[spread operators] (``++...++`` and ``++...?++``) are convenient ways to flatten a collection into a collection literal, that work on multiple types of collections supporting literals: `List`, `Map`, and `Set`.

When a spread operator is used in a `List` literal, it looks like the following:

[source,dart]
----
final list = [1, 2, ...anIterable, 3, 4];
----

which is more concise, readable, and efficient than the equivalent code not using it:

[source,dart]
----
final list = [1, 2]..addAll(anIterable)..addAll([3, 4]);
----

In the example above, the spread operator will iterate over the elements of `anIterable`, building the resulting list.

There is no need to call `toList` on the `Iterable` before spreading it into the list literal, because the spread operator will take care of the iteration.

[source,dart]
----
final list = [1, 2, ...anIterable.toList(), 3, 4]; // toList not necessary
----

In general, once the intent of flatting an `Iterable` into a collection literal has been expressed by using the ``++...++`` operator, it's best let the compiler figure out what is the best way to achieve that, based on the type of collection literal (`List`, `Set`, `Map`) and the actual type of provided `Iterable`.

=== What is the potential impact?

Calling `toList` unnecessarily is not only redundant and more verbose: it may result in unnecessary memory allocation and performance overhead, since an intermediate `List` instance would be created, just to be thrown away once it is spread into the list literal.

== How to fix it

Remove the `toList` call from the `Iterable` passed to the spread operator.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
final list = [
    1, 
    2, 
    ...anIterable.toList(), // Noncompliant 
    3, 
    4
];
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
final list = [
    1, 
    2, 
    ...anIterable,
    3, 
    4
];
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
final list = [
    1, 
    2, 
    ...?aNullableIterable?.toList(), // Noncompliant 
    3, 
    4
];
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
final list = [
    1, 
    2, 
    ...?aNullableIterable,
    3, 
    4
];
----
