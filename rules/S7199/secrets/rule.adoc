exploiting the secret.


// Set value that can be used to refer to the type of secret in, for example:
// "An attacker can use this {secret_type} to ..."
// Commonly used values: access token, api key, application secret, application key or consumer key, service password, OAuth token, deployment password
:secret_type: secret

// Where possible, use predefined content for common impacts. This content can
// be found in the folder "shared_content/secrets/impact".
// When using predefined content, search for any required variables to be set and include them in this file.
// Not adding them will not trigger warnings.
