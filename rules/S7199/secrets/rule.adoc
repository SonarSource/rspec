=== What is the potential impact?

// Optional: Give a general description of the secret and what it's used for.

// TODO: create a new shared_content/secrets/impact/generic.adoc with generic impact contents ?
Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

// Secret may allow hosting arbitrary files
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/malware_distribution.adoc[]

// Secret may allow accessing or compromising sensitive data
// TODO: text implies authentication secrets, generalize?
//include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/data_compromise.adoc[]

// Secret may allow uploading artifacts to services used elsewhere in the supply chain
// This is specific for code and artifact repositories
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/supply_chain_attack.adoc[]

// Secret may be used to trigger workflows
// This is webhook-specific
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/codeless_vulnerability_chaining.adoc[]

// OAuth tokens may allow accessing 3rd party services
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/oauth_token_compromise.adoc[]

// Mailing service compromise may allow sending spam, which may result in account termination
// TODO: this is currently specific to "mailing service APIs", generalize?
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/suspicious_activities_termination.adoc[]

// Sensitive information leak / identity impersonation, e.g., through leaked signing secret
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/security_downgrade.adoc[]

// Audit trail discrepancies
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/non_repudiation.adoc[]

// Package repository secrets may allow access to source code etc.
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/source_code_compromise.adoc[]

// Spamming automated calls may cause large bills and rate limited service access
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/exceed_rate_limits.adoc[]

// For blockchain specific tokens
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/blockchain_data_exposure.adoc[]

// Specific for banking / financial transaction tokens, causing financial loss
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/banking_financial_loss.adoc[]

// Secret can be used to send spam or phish users
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/phishing.adoc[]

// Secret may allow modifying application data that
// TODO: likely specific for object stores, ftp servers, etc.
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/data_modification.adoc[]

// Specific to services that are used to share PII (personal infos, chat logs, ..)
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/personal_data_compromise.adoc[]

// Secret may allow accessing financial data, like CC information or confidential financial reports
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/disclosure_of_financial_data.adoc[]

// Secret may allow occurring financial losses through 3rd party API usage
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/financial_loss.adoc[]

// Secret may be used to modify dashboards to corrupt shown data
// TODO: requires setting service_name
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/dataviz_takeover.adoc[]

// Secret is related to IaaS providers and can be used to change DNS, launch VMs, etc.
// TODO: requires setting service_name
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/infrastructure_takeover.adoc[]

== How to fix it

// 1. Revoke leaked secrets
include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/revoke.adoc[]

// 2. Analyze recent use to identify misuse
include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/recent_use.adoc[]

// 3. Use a secret vault in the future
include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/vault.adoc[]

// 4. Never hard-code secrets
include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/default.adoc[]

// OAuth PKCE is very specific to OAuth 2.0
// include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/oauth_pkce.adoc[]
