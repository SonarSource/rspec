Gradle performs dependency verification by comparing the downloaded dependencies against known checksums or signatures. This ensures that the dependencies have not been tampered with and are exactly what the developer expects.

=== Checksum Verification

Checksum verification involves generating a unique hash value (checksum) for the dependency file and comparing it against a known, trusted checksum. If the checksums match, the dependency is considered valid. This method ensures that the file has not been altered since the checksum was generated.

=== Signature Verification

Signature verification involves using cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of the dependency. The dependency is signed with a private key, and the signature can be verified using the corresponding public key. This method not only ensures the integrity of the file but also verifies the identity of the entity that signed it.
