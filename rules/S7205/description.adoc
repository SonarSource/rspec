Software projects often rely on external code libraries, known as dependencies. Package managers such as Gradle, allow developpers to reference dependencies for their projects.
These dependencies simplify development, but also introduce risk as they download and include external code based on a project's configuration. 
Integrity checking is the step of verifying that the downloaded or included dependency code is exactly what the developer expects. Without this verification, the application cannot guarantee that the dependency is legitimate.

== Why is this an issue?

Failing to verify the integrity of dependencies before using them is a significant security problem. It exposes your application, and potentially your users, to several risks. The core issue is that you're running code from an untrusted source without checking it, effectively giving an attacker a direct pathway into your application.

This is often a key component of what's called a "supply chain attack." The attacker isn't directly attacking your application. Instead, they're attacking a component you use. This is an important consideration because the attack's source is less obvious. You might diligently secure your own code, but overlook the risk introduced by external dependencies.
