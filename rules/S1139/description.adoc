Executing a ``++DELETE++`` statement without a ``++WHERE++`` clause will delete all rows in a table.


If that is truly what is intended, the ``++TRUNCATE++`` statement should be used because it is faster and uses fewer system and transaction log resources. Moreover when using the ``++TRUNCATE++`` statement, there is no ambiguity about the purpose of the SQL statement.


If removing all content from the table is not what is intended, a ``++WHERE++`` clause should be added.
