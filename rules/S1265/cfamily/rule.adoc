== Why is this an issue?

A class can override the `operator new` when it needs to customize memory allocation.
Not overriding the `operator delete` method means relying on the program to release the allocated memory automatically. It is unlikely that the program will know how to do it correctly. To ensure it does, the class must override the `operator delete` method in a complementary manner.

[source,cpp]
----
class AirPlane {
public:
  void* operator new(size_t size);
  void operator delete(void* deadObject, size_t size); // Compliant: it releases the memory allocated in operator new()
};
----

Overriding both operators will ensure that your program does not consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to a crash. Otherwise, memory leaks or memory corruption will result.

\[~ann.campbell.2] word "class" looks strange for me after "operator delete" in description. Is it a typo or just bad knowledge of english by me?
