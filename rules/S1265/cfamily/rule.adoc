== Why is this an issue?

The `operator new` allocates memory for objects, and the `operator delete` frees the memory allocated by the matching `operator new`. When a class needs to customize memory allocation, it can override the `operator new` to use a custom memory allocation strategy and override the `operator delete` accordingly.

If the `operator delete` is not overridden alongside the `operator new`, the program will call its default implementation, which may not be suitable for the custom memory allocation strategy used by the overridden `operator new`.

For instance, if the `operator new` draws memory from a preallocated buffer instead of allocating memory, the `operator delete` should not call the `free` function to release the memory. Reciprocally, if the `operator new` allocate memory with `malloc`, the `operator delete` must call `free`.

On the other hand, if the `operator delete` is overridden without overriding the `operator new`, it is suspicious because it may not correctly release the memory allocated by the default `operator new`.

By defining the `operator delete` along with the `operator new`, the memory is deallocated in a way consistent with the custom allocation strategy used by the `operator new`.

=== What is the potential impact?

Overriding only one of the two operators may result in your program consuming more and more memory over time, eventually leading to a crash. 

Deallocating memory that was not allocated with the corresponding strategy results in undefined behavior.

== How to fix it

Each override of the `operator new` should have a matching overridden `operator delete` and vice versa.

=== Code examples

Imagine a custom allocator `MyAllocator`:

[source,cpp]
----
class MyAllocator {
public:
    void* allocate(size_t size) {
        void* p = malloc(size);
        if (!p) {
            throw std::bad_alloc();
        }
        return p;
    }

    void deallocate(void* p) {
        free(p);
    }
};
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass {
public:
    // Noncompliant: there is no matching override of the delete operator
    void* operator new(size_t size) {
        return allocator.allocate(size);
    }

private:
    static MyAllocator allocator;
};

void f() {
    MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
    delete obj; // It will call the default implementation of the operator delete
    // and this latter will not call the MyAllocator::deallocate function to correctly release the memory
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass {
public:
    void* operator new(size_t size) {
        return allocator.allocate(size);
    }

    void operator delete(void* p) {
        allocator.deallocate(p);
    }

private:
    static MyAllocator allocator;
};

void f() {
    MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
    delete obj; // It will call MyClass::delete to correctly deallocate the memory
}
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] word "class" looks strange for me after "operator delete" in description. Is it a typo or just bad knowledge of english by me?
