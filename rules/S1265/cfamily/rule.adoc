Overriding ``++operator new++`` typically indicates that custom memory allocation is required for the class. When that's the case, it must be balanced with a custom memory deallocation in a matching ``++operator delete++`` method. Otherwise memory leaks or memory corruption will result.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class AirPlane
{
public:
  void* operator new(size_t size);
  void fly();
};
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class AirPlane
{
public:
  void* operator new(size_t size);
  void operator delete(void* deadObject, size_t size);
  void fly();
};
----
