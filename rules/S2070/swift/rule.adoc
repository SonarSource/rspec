\[~pierre-loup.tristant], Why did you replace "Noncompliant Code Example" with "Sensitive Code Example"? Isn't "Noncompliant Code Example" one of the standard headers (along with "Compliant Solution", and "See")?

"Sensitive Code Example" is what we use for "Security Hotspots" instead of "Noncompliant Code Example".

Here in fact we should keep "Noncompliant Code Example" and use "Sensitive Code Example" for RSPEC-4790
