=== Highlighting

Secondary is always:

* message: "Inconsistent type check."
* location: the last type check giving us information on the variables' type. Ex: an isinstance call.

Primary varies depending on the issue:

* s2159 - Equality between incompatible types:
** message: Fix this equality check; Previous type checks suggest that operands have incompatible types.

* s3403 - identity check between incompatible types
** message: Fix this "is" check; Previous type checks suggest that operands have incompatible types.

* s5607 - operations on incompatible types
** message: Fix this "+" operation; Previous type checks suggest that operands have incompatible types.

* s5756 - calling a non-callable type
** message: Fix this call; Previous type checks suggest that "param" is not callable.

* s5644 - calling ``++__getitem__++`` on type which doesn't have this method
** message: Fix this __getitem__ operation; Previous type checks suggest that "param" does not have this method.

* s3862 - iteration operation on a non-iterable type
** message: Fix this unpacking; Previous type checks suggest that "param" is not iterable.

* s5795 - identity check relies on interpreter's cache
** message: Fix this condition; Previous type checks suggest that it relies on interpreter's cache.

* s5632 - ``++raise++`` used with a non-exception type
** message: Fix this "raise" statement; Previous type checks suggest that "param" is not an exception.
