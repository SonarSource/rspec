This rule raises an issue when a pre/post increment or decrement operator is used.

== Why is this an issue?

Python has no pre/post increment/decrement operator. For instance, ``x{plus}{plus}`` and ``++x--++`` will fail to parse. More importantly, ``{plus}{plus}x`` and ``++--x++`` will do nothing. To increment a number, simply write ``++x += 1++``.

=== Code examples 

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
++x # Noncompliant: pre and post increment operators do not exist in Python.

x-- # Noncompliant: pre and post decrement operators do not exist in Python.
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
x += 1

x -= 1
