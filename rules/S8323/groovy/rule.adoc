This rule raises an issue when property names start with uppercase letters or use underscores instead of camelCase for multi-word properties.

== Why is this an issue?

In Groovy, properties automatically generate getter and setter methods following JavaBeans conventions. When property names don't follow the recommended naming pattern, several issues can arise.

The JavaBeans specification expects property names to start with lowercase letters and use camelCase for multi-word properties. This convention ensures that generated accessor methods have predictable names. For example, a property named `firstName` generates `getFirstName()` and `setFirstName()` methods.

When properties start with uppercase letters or use underscores, the generated accessor methods may not follow expected patterns. This can lead to:

* Naming conflicts between properties and their accessor methods
* Confusion for developers expecting standard JavaBeans naming
* Compatibility issues with frameworks that rely on JavaBeans conventions
* Inconsistent code style within the project

Groovy's property naming logic has special handling for acronyms and edge cases, but following the standard lowercase-first, camelCase pattern avoids these complexities and ensures consistent, predictable behavior.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using non-standard property naming can cause naming conflicts with generated accessor methods and reduce compatibility with JavaBeans-based frameworks. It may also lead to confusion for developers who expect standard naming conventions, making the code harder to maintain and integrate with other systems.

== How to fix it

Rename properties to start with lowercase letters and use camelCase for multi-word properties. This ensures compatibility with JavaBeans conventions and generates predictable accessor method names.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Person {
    String FirstName  // Noncompliant: starts with uppercase
    String URL_PATH   // Noncompliant: uses underscores
    int user_ID       // Noncompliant: uses underscores
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Person {
    String firstName  // starts with lowercase
    String urlPath    // uses camelCase
    int userId        // uses camelCase
}
----
