This rule raises an issue when Groovy property names do not follow camelCase.

== Why is this an issue?

In Groovy, defining a property implicitly defines JavaBeans-style accessor methods (getters/setters). Frameworks and tools that rely on JavaBeans conventions assume properties are named in camelCase so that accessor names are predictable.

When a property name starts with an uppercase letter or contains underscores, the generated accessor names can be surprising and inconsistent with what other code expects. This reduces readability and can lead to integration issues (for example, with data binding, serialization, or reflection-based frameworks).

=== What is the potential impact?

Non-camelCase property names can make code harder to understand and can break or complicate integrations with libraries that expect standard JavaBeans naming.

== How to fix it

Rename properties to camelCase.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Person {
    String FirstName  // Noncompliant: should be camelCase
    String URL_PATH   // Noncompliant: underscores are not camelCase
    int user_ID       // Noncompliant: underscores are not camelCase
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Person {
    String firstName  // Compliant
    String urlPath    // Compliant
    int userId        // Compliant
}
----
