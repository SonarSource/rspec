== Why is this an issue?

Use either the ``++// ...++`` or ``++/* ... */++`` comment syntax, but be consistent and do not mix them within the same file.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
/* Noncompliant; both comment syntaxes are used in the same file */
// Foo
/* Bar */
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
// Compliant; uniform comment syntax
// Foo
// Bar
----
