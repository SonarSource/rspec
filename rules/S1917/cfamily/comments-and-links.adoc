Irrelevant because:

ABAP has ``++*++`` and ``++"++`` comments, but for two different locations, not exchangeable.

Java, JavaScript, Flex, PHP, Swift, TypeScript have ``++/*++`` and ``++//++``, but ``++/**++`` is used for api doc and ``++//++`` in the code.

Python has ``++#++`` and ``++"""++`` comments, but for two different usages, piece of code and docstrings.

C#, PL/SQL, T-SQL the rule [RSPEC-2544] is more appropriate.

Irrelevant for Go, there is a more specific, different recommendation for comments, explained in https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary[Effective Go], that probably deserves it's own rule.
