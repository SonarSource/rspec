<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_personal_data">Compromise of sensitive personal data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of service is often used to exchange information that could include
personal information, chat logs, and other private data that users have shared
on the platform. This is called Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
The leaked app key could provide a gateway for unauthorized individuals to
access and misuse this data, compromising the privacy and safety of the
application users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many industries and locations, there are legal and compliance requirements
to protect sensitive data. If this kind of sensitive personal data gets leaked,
companies face legal consequences, penalties, or violations of privacy laws.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application&#8217;s
users.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
