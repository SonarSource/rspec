Once a value is known to be ``++null++`` or non-``++null++``, there's no reason to re-check it unless it has been changed (or potentially changed) in the interim. Doing so anyway may may just be an over-abundance of caution, but it could indicate a bug.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void assignCoach(Team team, Person person) {

  if (team.hasCoach()) {  // team is dereferenced
    return;
  }

  if (team != null) {  // Noncompliant; if we got this far, team is not null
    //...
  }

  if (person != null) {
    // ...
    if (disqualified) {
      person = getAlternate();
    }
  }

  if (person != null) { // Compliant; person may have changed since last check
    team.setCoach(person);
  }

  if (person != null) {  // Noncompliant; no changes to person since last check
    // ...
