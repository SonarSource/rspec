Recursion happens when control enters a loop that has no exit. This can happen a method invokes itself, when a pair of methods invoke each other, or when `goto` statements are used to move between two segments of code. It can be a useful tool, but unless the method includes a provision to break out of the recursion and `return`, the recursion will continue until the stack overflows and the program crashes.
