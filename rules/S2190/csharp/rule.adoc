== Why is this an issue?

When execution enters a loop that lacks an exit condition or the exit condition is always false, the program will be looping indefinitely.
This can happen in multiple scenarios:

* `while` and `for` loops
[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public int Sum(List<int> items)
{
    var i = 0;
    var result = 0;
    while (true) // Noncompliant: forgot to check i < items.Count
    {
        result += items[i];
        i++;
    }
    return result;
}
----

In this example, the `while` loop will never be exited, because the condition is always `true`.

* `goto` statements 
[source,csharp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public int Sum(List<int> items)
{
    var result = 0;
    var i = 0;
iteration: 
    // Noncompliant: forgot to check i < items.Count
    result += items[i];
    i++;
    goto iteration;
    return result;
}
----

In this example, there is nothing that stops `goto` from being executed over and over again.

This concept does not only apply to loops, but also to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)[recursion],
a technique used to define a problem in terms of a simpler version of the problem itself. 

When a recursive method lacks an exit condition, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack[call stack] will reach its limit and the program will crash due to a stack overflow error.
This can happen in multiple scenarios:

* a method invoking itself (direct recursion)
[source,csharp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int Pow(int num, int exponent)
{
  return num * Pow(num, exponent - 1); // Noncompliant: no condition under which Pow isn't re-called
}
----

In this example, `Pow` will keep calling `Pow` with `exponent - 1` forever, until the program crashes by a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.stackoverflowexception[StackOverflowException].

* a group of methods mutually invoking each other (indirect recursion)
[source,csharp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int Foo(int n) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("foo");
  Bar(n-1); // Noncompliant: always calls Bar
}

int Bar(int n) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("bar");
  Foo(n); // Noncompliant: always calls Foo
}
----

In this example, `Foo` will always call `Bar`, which will always call `Foo`, etc. Until the program eventually crashes by a StackOverflowException.

The program's logic should incorporate a mechanism to break out of the loop.
Here are some ways to achieve that:

* `while` or `for` condition should eventually evaluate to `false` 
[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public int Sum(List<int> items)
{
    var i = 0;
    var result = 0;
    while (i < items.Count)
    {
        result += items[i];
        i++;
    }
    return result;
}
----

In this example, the `while` loop will stop evaluating to `true` when the increment `i` will reach `items.Count - 1`, and then return the result.

* As https://rules.sonarsource.com/csharp/RSPEC-907[S907] generally suggests, avoid using `goto` statements. Instead, you can use a loop statement or explicit recursion.
[source,csharp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
public int Sum(List<int> items)
{
    var i = 0;
    var result = 0;
    while (i < items.Count)
    {
        result += items[i];
        i++;
    }
    return result;
}
----

* Self-invoking should happen under a condition that eventually evaluates to `false`
[source,csharp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
int Pow(int num, int exponent) 
{
  if (exponent > 1) // recursion is now conditional and stoppable
  {  
    num = num * Pow(num, exponent - 1);
  }
  return num;
}
----

* Introduce a condition that breaks the invocation loop of the group of methods
[source,csharp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
int Foo(int n) 
{
  if (n > 0) // conditionally calls Bar
  {
    Console.WriteLine("foo");
    Bar(n-1); 
  }
}

int Bar(int n) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("bar");
  Foo(n);
}
----

=== Recursion in Depth

Recursion provides some benefits.

* **Simplified code**: recursion can often lead to more concise and elegant code by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
* **Improved code readability**: compared to iterative solutions, recursive solutions can be easier to understand and reason about.

However, it has some disadvantages as well.

* **Stack overflow**: Recursive functions can lead to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.stackoverflowexception[stack overflow] if the recursion is too deep, potentially causing the program to crash.
* **Performance overhead**: Recursive function calls can lead to poor performance due to the need to push and pop https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Stack_frame#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20stack,only%20exist%20at%20run%2Dtime[stack frames], making them potentially slower than iterative solutions.
* **Difficulty in debugging**: Debugging recursive code can be challenging, as multiple recursive calls can make it harder to track the flow of execution and identify logical errors.
* **Space complexity**: Recursive algorithms may require more memory compared to iterative approaches, as each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.
* **Lack of control**: Recursion can sometimes lead to infinite loops or unexpected behavior if not properly implemented or terminated, making it crucial to have proper base cases and exit conditions.
