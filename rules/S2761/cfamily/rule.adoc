== Why is this an issue?

The repetition of a unary operator is usually a typo. The second operator invalidates the first one in most cases:

[source,cpp]
----
int i = 1;

int j = - - -i;  // Noncompliant: just use -i
int k = ~~i;     // Noncompliant: same as i

bool b = false;
bool c = !!!b;   // Noncompliant: same as !b
----

The repetition of increment and decrement operators may have been done on purpose, but doing so obfuscates the meaning:


[source,cpp]
----
int i = 1;
int j = ++ ++i;  // Noncompliant
int k = ----i; // Noncompliant
----

Repeated increment and decrement operations should be simplified using ``+=``

[source,cpp]
----
int i = 1;
i += 2;
int j = i;
i -=2;
int k = i;
----


This rule raises an issue for sequences of: ``++!++``, ``++~++``, ``++-++``, and ``+``, and in {cpp} for repetitions of the increment and decrement operators.

=== Exceptions

Boolean normalization ``++!!++`` is ignored.
