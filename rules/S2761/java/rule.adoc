== Why is this an issue?

The repetition of a unary operator is usually a typo. The second operator invalidates the first one in most cases:

[source,java]
----
int i = 1;

int j = - - -i;  // Noncompliant: just use -i
int k = ~~~i;    // Noncompliant: same as i
int m = + +i;    // Noncompliant: operators are useless here

boolean b = false;
boolean c = !!!b;   // Noncompliant
----

On the other hand, the repetition of increment and decrement operators may have been done on purpose, but doing so obfuscates the meaning, and should be simplified.

[source,java]
----
int i = 1;
int j = ++ ++i;  // Noncompliant
int k = i-- --; // Noncompliant
----

Repeated increment and decrement operations should be simplified using ``+=`` and ``-=``:

[source,java]
----
int i = 1;
i += 2;
int j = i;
int k = i;
i -=2;
----

This rule raises an issue for sequences of: ``++!++``, ``++~++``, ``++-++``, ``{plus}``, ``{plus}{plus}`` prefix increments and ``--`` prefix decrements.

=== Exceptions

Overflow handling for GWT compilation using ``++~~++`` is ignored.
