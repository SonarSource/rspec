The needless repetition of an operator is usually a typo. There is no reason to write `+!!!i+` when `+!i+` will do.

On the other hand, the repetition of increment and decrement operators may have been done on purpose, but doing so obfuscates the meaning, and should be simplified.

This rule raises an issue for sequences of: `+!+`, `+~+`, `+-+`, and `+\++`.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int i = 1;

int j = - - -i;  // Noncompliant; just use -i
int k = ~~~i;    // Noncompliant; same as i
int m = + +i;    // Noncompliant; operators are useless here

boolean b = false;
boolean c = !!!b;   // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
int i =  1;

int j = -i;
int k = ~i;
int m =  i;

boolean b = false;
boolean c = !b;
----

== Exceptions

Overflow handling for GWT compilation using `+~~+` is ignored.
