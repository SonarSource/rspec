== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``++Not++`` operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Such repetitions are usually typos.

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim b As Boolean = False
Dim c As Boolean = Not Not b 'Noncompliant: same as b
----

Either this is a bug if the operator was meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.
