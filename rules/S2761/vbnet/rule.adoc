== Why is this an issue?

Calling the  ``++Not++`` operator twice is usually a typo. The second invocation invalidates the first one:

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim b As Boolean = False
Dim c As Boolean = Not Not b 'Noncompliant: equivalent to "b"
----

Either this is a bug if the operator was meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.
