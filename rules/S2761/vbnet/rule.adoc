== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``++Not++`` operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Either this is a bug, if the operator was actually meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim b As Boolean = False
Dim c As Boolean = Not Not b 'Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim b As Boolean = False
Dim c As Boolean = b 'Compliant
----
