== Why is this an issue?

The repetition of a prefix operator (``+``, ``++-++``, or ``++NOT++``) is usually a typo. The second operator invalidates the first one:

[source,sql]
----
IF NOT ( NOT foo = 5 ) THEN  -- Noncompliant: equivalent to "foo = 5"
  value := ++1;              -- Noncompliant: equivalent to "+1"
END IF;
----
