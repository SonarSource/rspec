== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``+``, ``++-++`` or ``++NOT++`` prefix operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are typically typos.

[source,sql]
----
IF NOT ( NOT foo = 5 ) THEN  -- Noncompliant: same as foo = 5
  value := ++1;              -- Noncompliant: same as +1
END IF;
----

Either this is a bug if the operator was meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.
