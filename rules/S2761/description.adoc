Calling the ``++!++`` or ``++~++`` prefix operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are typically caused by accidentally double-tapping the key in question without noticing.

Either this is a bug, if the operator was actually meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.
