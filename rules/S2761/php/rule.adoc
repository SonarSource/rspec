== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``++!++`` or ``++~++`` prefix operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are typically typos. Either this is a bug if the operator was meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.

[source,php]
----
$a = false;
$b = ~~$a; // Noncompliant: Same as $a
----

Calling ``++!++`` twice is sometimes done instead of using the dedicated `boolval()` function. However, the latter increases the code readability and should be preferred.

[source,php]
----
$a = 0;
$b = !!$a; // Noncompliant: Same as boolval($a)
