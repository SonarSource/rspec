== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``++!++`` or ``++~++`` prefix operator twice is usually a typo. The second invocation invalidates the first one:

[source,php]
----
$a = false;
$b = ~~$a; // Noncompliant: same as $a
----

While calling ``++!++`` twice is equivalent to calling the `boolval()` function, the latter increases the code readability, so it should be preferred.

[source,php]
----
$a = 0;
$b = !!$a; // Noncompliant: Same as boolval($a)
----
