== Why is this an issue?

The repetition of a unary operator is usually a typo. The second operator invalidates the first one in most cases

[source,go]
----
  var a int = 1
  var flag bool = true

  var a1 int = ^^^a // Noncompliant: same as ^a
  var flag2 bool  = !!!flag  // Noncompliant: same as !flag
----

On the other hand, the repetition of increment and decrement operators may have been done on purpose, but doing so obfuscates the meaning.

[source,go]
----
var i int = 1
var j int = ++ ++i  // Noncompliant
var k int = -- --i  // Noncompliant
----

Repeated increment and decrement operations should be simplified using ``+=`` and ``-=``:

[source,go]
----
var i int = 1
i += 2
var j int = i
i -=2
var k int = i
----

This rule raises an issue for sequences of: ``++!++``, ``++^++``, ``++-++``, ``{plus}``, increment and decrement operators.
