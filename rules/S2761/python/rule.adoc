== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``++not++`` or ``++~++`` prefix operator twice might be redundant: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are typically typos. Either this is a bug if the operator was meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.

[source,python]
----
a = False
b = ~~a # Noncompliant: same as a
----

Calling ``++not++`` twice is sometimes done instead of using the dedicated `bool()` built-in function. However, the latter increases the code readability and should be preferred.

[source,python]
----
a = 0

b = not not a # Noncompliant: use bool()
----

=== Exceptions

If the ``++~++`` function has been overloaded in a customized class and has been called twice, no warning is raised as it is assumed to be the expected usage.

Use the "{not|~}" operator just once or not at all.

Use the "bool()" builtin function instead of calling "not" twice.
