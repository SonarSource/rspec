Calling the ``++not++`` or ``++~++`` prefix operator twice might be redundant: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are typically caused by accidentally double-tapping the key in question without noticing. Either this is a bug, if the operator was actually meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.

== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,python]
----
a = 0
b = False

c = not not a # Noncompliant
d = ~~b # Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,python]
----
a = 0
b = False

c = not a # Noncompliant
d = ~b # Noncompliant
----
