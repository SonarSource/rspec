== Why is this an issue?

Calling the ``++not++`` or ``++~++`` prefix operator twice is usually a typo. The second invocation invalidates the first one:

[source,python]
----
a = False
b = ~~a # Noncompliant: same as a
----

Calling ``++not++`` twice is sometimes done instead of using the dedicated `bool()` built-in function. However, the latter increases the code readability and should be preferred.

[source,python]
----
a = 0

b = not not a # Noncompliant: use bool()
----

=== Exceptions

The rule does not raise an issue if the ``++~++`` function is overloaded in a customized class, as it is assumed to be the expected usage.

=== Message

Use the "{not|~}" operator just once or not at all.

Use the "bool()" builtin function instead of calling "not" twice.
