This rule raises an issue when `fetch()` or `new Request()` is called with a body option while using GET or HEAD methods.

== Why is this an issue?

The HTTP specification defines that GET and HEAD requests should not contain a request body. When you provide a body with these methods, the Fetch API throws a `TypeError` at runtime.

GET requests are designed to retrieve data from a server without modifying anything. Including a body contradicts this purpose and violates HTTP standards. Similarly, HEAD requests are meant to retrieve only headers, making a body meaningless.

When no method is specified in fetch options, GET is used by default. This means that providing a body without explicitly setting a method like POST will also cause the same error.

This issue typically occurs when developers copy request code between different HTTP methods without adjusting the options appropriately.

=== What is the potential impact?

This code will throw a `TypeError` at runtime, causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. Users may experience broken functionality, and the error might not be caught during development if the problematic code path isn't tested thoroughly.

=== How to fix?


Remove the body option when using GET requests (default method).

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const response = await fetch('/', {body: 'foo=bar'}); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const response = await fetch('/');
