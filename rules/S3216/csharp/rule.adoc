== Why is this an issue?

After an ``++await++``ed ``++Task++`` has executed, you can continue execution in the original, calling thread or any arbitrary thread. Unless the rest of the code needs the context from which the ``++Task++`` was spawned, ``++Task.ConfigureAwait(false)++`` should be used to keep execution in the ``++Task++`` thread to avoid the need for context switching and the possibility of deadlocks.


This rule raises an issue when code in a class library targeting .Net Framework ``++await++``s a ``++Task++`` and continues execution in the original calling thread.

The rule does not raise for .Net Core libraries as there is no ``++SynchronizationContext++`` in .Net Core.
