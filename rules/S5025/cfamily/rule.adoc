== Why is this an issue?

If you manage memory manually, it's your responsibility to ``++delete++`` all memory created with ``++new++``, and to make sure it's ``++delete++``d  once and only once. Ensuring this is done is error-prone, especially when your function can have early exit points. 


Fortunately, the {cpp} language provides tools that automatically manage memory for you. Using them systematically makes the code simpler and  more robust without sacrificing performance.


This rule raises an issue when you use:

* ``++new++`` -  you should prefer a factory function that returns a smart pointer, such as ``++std::make_unique++`` or, if shared ownership is required, ``++std::make_shared++``,
* ``++new[]++`` -  you should prefer a container class, such as ``++std::vector++``,
* ``++delete++`` or ``++delete[]++`` - if you followed the previous advice, there is no need to manually release memory.

If your compiler does not support ``++make_unique++``, it's easy to write your own:

----
template<typename T, typename... Args>
std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Args&&... args) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...));
}
----


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  auto c = new Circle(0, 0, 5);
  c->draw();
  delete c;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  auto c = make_unique<Circle>(0, 0, 5);
  c->draw();
  unique_ptr<Circle> c2{new Circle(0, 0, 5)}; // Clumsy, but still compliant by exception
}
----


=== Exceptions

If the result of a new is immediately passed as an argument to a function, we assume that the function takes ownership of the newly created object, and won't raise an issue.
