<p>You can provide your own hash function when using a standard library container based on a hash table (for instance, <code>std::unordered_map</code>). One of the requirements of the hash function is that it should not throw exceptions.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t follow this requirement and your hash function throws, you may end up with corrupted data in your container.</p>

<p>\[~abbas.sabra]: I think this rule might miss it&#8217;s target a little bit: For me, the important point is that hash function should not throw. As a consequence, it might be interesting to declare it noexcept, but this looks to me like an indirect consequence. If you agree, I can reword the rule that way, otherwise, let me know :)</p>

<p>I updated the rule, but I think we might still miss to opportunity to have a better rule: "Hash function should be written correctly". It would check for exceptions, but also for other things. The problem is I&#8217;m not sure what these other things might be (I know some constraints, but I don&#8217;t know how to realistically check them&#8230;&#8203; If anybody has an idea?)</p>

<p>\[~abbas.sabra] and [~loic.joly] does this rule raise issues only on <code>throw</code> or also on a missing <code>noexcept</code>? I think the latter is implicit in the code samples, but it should be either obvious in the description or made explicit with a "This rule raises an issue when" sentence.</p>

<p>The rule has some value for legacy code, dating from a time where noexcept did not yet exist. Raising on missing noexcept in those cases might look like a false positive</p>

I find the current message "Declare this hash 'noexcept'." not really consistent with the description of the rule: if a hash function does not throw, there will be no warning but the message still applies&#8230;&#8203;</p>
