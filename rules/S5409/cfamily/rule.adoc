== Why is this an issue?

When you are using a standard library container based on a hash table (for instance, ``++std::unordered_map++``), you can provide your own hash function. One of the requirements of the hash function is that it should not throw exceptions.


If you don't follow this requirement, and your hash function throws, you may end-up with corrupt data in your container.


Since this function is not supposed to throw, you should also declare it ``++noexcept++``. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyHash{
  size_t operator() (Customer c) const // Noncompliant, copying may throw
  {
    if (c.name().empty()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("You should know the customer name at this point"); // Noncompliant
    }
    return std::hash<std::string>()(c.name());
  }
};
std::unordered_set<Customer, MyHash> mySet;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyHash{
  size_t operator() (Customer const &c) const noexcept
  {
    return std::hash<std::string>()(c.name());
  }
};
std::unordered_set<Customer, MyHash> mySet;
----
