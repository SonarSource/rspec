== Why is this an issue?

When you are using a standard library container based on a hash table (for instance, ``++std::unordered_map++``), you can provide your own hash function. One of the requirements of the hash function is that it should not throw exceptions.


If you don't follow this requirement, and your hash function throws, you may end-up with corrupt data in your container.


Since this function is not supposed to throw, you should also declare it ``++noexcept++``. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyHash{
  size_t operator() (Customer c) const // Noncompliant, copying may throw
  {
    if (c.name().empty()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("You should know the customer name at this point"); // Noncompliant
    }
    return std::hash<std::string>()(c.name());
  }
};
std::unordered_set<Customer, MyHash> mySet;
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyHash{
  size_t operator() (Customer const &c) const noexcept
  {
    return std::hash<std::string>()(c.name());
  }
};
std::unordered_set<Customer, MyHash> mySet;
----

\[~abbas.sabra]: I think this rule might miss it's target a little bit: For me, the important point is that hash function should not throw. As a consequence, it might be interesting to declare it noexcept, but this looks to me like an indirect consequence. If you agree, I can reword the rule that way, otherwise, let me know :)

I updated the rule, but I think we might still miss to opportunity to have a better rule: "Hash function should be written correctly". It would check for exceptions, but also for other things. The problem is I'm not sure what these other things might be (I know some constraints, but I don't know how to realistically check them... If anybody has an idea?)

\[~abbas.sabra] and [~loic.joly] does this rule raise issues only on ``++throw++`` or also on a missing ``++noexcept++``? I think the latter is implicit in the code samples, but it should be either obvious in the description or made explicit with a "This rule raises an issue when" sentence.

This is a good and difficult question:

* The rule has some value for legacy code, dating from a time where noexcept did not yet exist. Raising on missing noexcept in those cases might look like a false positive
* Raising on missing noexcept would have the value of enforcing good practices, in addition to prevent throwing
\[~abbas.sabra]: What do you think?

I think we should detect the standard. If it is >= {cpp}11 we should raise an issue on missing noexecpt.

\[~loic.joly] Yes, but in that case, it is not really a false positive. 


Do you think it is a good idea to divide it into two?

* The first flags throwing hash functions.
* The second is part of [|RSPEC-5018|https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-5018] => Hash, Move, and swap operations should be "noexcept"

In my opinion, I would divide it into 2 RSPECS as [~abbas.sabra] suggests:

* one about hash functions that should not throw (as described in current RSPEC)
* one about hash functions that should be declared no except (not sure if it should be merged with the one dealing with `move` or destructors though...)
I find the current message "Declare this hash 'noexcept'." not really consistent with the description of the rule: if a hash function does not throw, there will be no warning but the message still applies...


In addition, it would be consistent with the rules about destructors:

* https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-3654[RSPEC-3654]: Destructors should be "noexcept"
* https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-1048[RSPEC-1048]: Destructors should not throw exceptions
