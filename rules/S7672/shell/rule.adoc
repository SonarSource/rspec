This rule raises an issue when function declarations in the same script use different syntax styles, mixing the use of the `function` keyword and parentheses inconsistently.

== Why is this an issue?

Shell scripts support multiple valid syntaxes for declaring functions:

* `function name() { ... }` - using both the `function` keyword and parentheses
* `name() { ... }` - using only parentheses
* `function name { ... }` - using only the `function` keyword

While all these forms are functionally equivalent, mixing different styles within the same script creates inconsistency that makes the code harder to read and maintain.

Inconsistent function declaration syntax can:

* Confuse developers who expect a uniform coding style
* Make code reviews more difficult
* Suggest a lack of attention to code quality standards
* Create unnecessary cognitive load when reading the script

Many style guides, including the Google Shell Style Guide, recommend choosing one declaration style and applying it consistently throughout the entire script.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue affects code readability and maintainability. While it doesn't cause runtime errors, inconsistent function declarations make scripts harder to understand and maintain, especially in team environments where multiple developers work on the same codebase.

=== How to fix?


Choose one function declaration style and apply it consistently throughout the script. Use the `function` keyword with parentheses for all function declarations.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function first_func() {
  echo "first"
}

second_func() {  # Noncompliant
  echo "second"
}

function third_func {  # Noncompliant
  echo "third"
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
function first_func() {
  echo "first"
}

function second_func() {
  echo "second"
}

function third_func() {
  echo "third"
}
