== Why is this an issue?

Cascade notation in dart is a convenient way of chaining several operations on the same object, while also having access to the instance methods and fields of the cascading object. With cascades you can write such code:

[source,dart]
----
var person = Person()
  ..firstName = 'John'
  ..lastName = 'Smith'
  ..age = 50;
----

which will be the equivalent of:

[source,dart]
----
var person = Person();
person.firstName = 'John';
person.lastName = 'Smith';
person.age = 50;
----

We can think of the cascade notation as a concise implementation of a builder pattern. Moreover, there's a null-safe version of it `?..` that will only access members if the cascading object isn't `null`.

While such notations looks appealing it doesn't really make sense to use for a single cascade section. For example, `person..read();` seems to be an overkill. In this case usual `person.read()` is much more clear. Sometimes it may also become a source of bugs. Looks at this example:

[source,dart]
----
var person = Person()..getName(); // here the instance of Person will be returned

var name = Person().getName(); // here the name will be returned
----

So be careful, when use cascading especially in combination with `var`. And always make sure the expected value is returned.

The other side of this notation os that it might be confused with a range operator `..` from other languages (like Kotlin). So using it without necessity will make code less readable and as a result less maintainable.

== How to fix it
Just replace cascade notation (`..`) with a single dot (`.`) or make sure you assign the constructed object.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Person()..doSomething();
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
var person = Person()..doSomething(); // if we want to return the Person instance
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Person()..doSomething();
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
Person().doSomething();
----
