== Why is this an issue?

Using `Thread.Sleep` in a test might introduce unpredictable and incosistent results depending on the environment. Furthermore, it will block the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)[thread], which means the system resources are not being fully used.

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
[TestMethod]
public void SomeTest()
{
    Thread.Sleep(500); // Noncompliant
    // assertions...
}
----

An alternative is a task-based asynchronous approach, using https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/[async and await].

More specifically the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.delay?view=net-7.0[Task.Delay] method should be used, because of the following advantages:

* It is asynchronous. This means that the thread will not be blocked, but instead will be reused by other operations.
* It is more precise than `Thread.Sleep`.
* It can be cancelled and continued, which gives more flexibility and control in the timing of your code.


[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
[TestMethod]
public async Task SomeTest()
{
    await Task.Delay(500);
    // assertions...
}
----

Another scenario is when some data might need to be mocked using https://github.com/moq/moq4[Moq], and a delay needs to be introduced.

[source,csharp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
[TestMethod]
public void UserService_Test()
{
    var userService = new Mock<UserService>();
    var expected = new User();

    userService
        .Setup(m => m.GetUserById(42))
        .Returns(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(500); // Noncompliant
            return Task.FromResult(expected);
        });

    // assertions...
}
----

An alternative is to use `ReturnsAsync` and pass the delay amount there:

[source,csharp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
[TestMethod]
public void UserService_Test()
{
    var userService = new Mock<UserService>();
    var expected = new User();

    userService
        .Setup(m => m.GetUserById(42))
        .ReturnsAsync(expected, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)); 

    // assertions...
}

Looks good.

Only suggestion I have is to put the timeout in the solution longer (2/3s?), otherwise it wouldn't fix the problem of dependency on the environment.

With awaitility we can use larger timeouts but still proceed quickly as soon as the polling conditions is satisfied.

Ok, updated. Thanks for your feedback! Feels free to modify it directly next time!
