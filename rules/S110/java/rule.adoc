include::../rule.adoc[]

This rule raises an issue when the inheritance tree, starting from `Object`, has a greater depth than is allowed.

The rule has one parameter to filter out classes of the count of inheritance. The following rules apply to define this parameter:

* ``++?++`` matches a single character
* ``++*++`` matches zero or more characters
* ``++**++`` matches zero or more packages

Examples:

* ``++java.fwk.AbstractFwkClass++``: the count stops when AbstractFwkClass class is reached.
* ``++java.fwk.*++``:  any member of java.fwkPackage package is reached.
* ``++java.fwk.**++``: same as above, but including sub-packages.

== Exceptions:

The rule stops counting when it encounters a class from one of the following packages (or sub-packages):

* ``++android.**++``
* ``++com.intellij.**++``
* ``++com.persistit.**++``
* ``++javax.swing.**++``
* ``++org.eclipse.**++``
* ``++org.springframework.**++``
