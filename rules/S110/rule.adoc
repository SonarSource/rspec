== Why is this an issue?

Inheritance is one of the most valuable concepts in object-oriented programming. It's a way to categorize and reuse code by creating collections of attributes and behaviors called classes, which can be based on previously created classes.

But abusing this concept by creating a deep inheritance tree can lead to very complex and unmaintainable source code. Most of the time, too deep of an inheritance tree is due to lousy object-oriented design, which leads to systematic use of "inheritance" when "composition" would be better suited.
