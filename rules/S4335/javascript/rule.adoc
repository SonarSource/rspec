== Why is this an issue?

An intersection type combines multiple types into one. This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need. However an intersection with a type without members doesn't change the resulting type. In the opposite the usage of ``++any++`` or ``++never++`` as part of an intersection will always results in ``++any++`` or ``++never++`` respectively. This is almost certainly an error.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function foo(p: MyType & null) { // Noncompliant
 // ...
}

function bar(p: MyType & any) { // Noncompliant
 // ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
function foo(p: MyType | null) {
 // ...
}
// or
function foo(p: MyType & AnotherType) {
 // ...
}

function bar(p: any) {
 // ...
}
----
