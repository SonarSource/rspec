== Why is this an issue?

Declare a constructor inside an ``++interface++``, and you will get a simple method with the name "constructor". The same thing will happen if you create a ``++new++`` method inside the ``++interface++``: you'll get a simple method named "new".


Instead, the intent was probably to specify that the type did not originate from a TypeScript file. In such cases, just use the ``++declare class++`` syntax.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
interface TypeDeclaredElsewhere {
  someMethod(): number;
  new(b: boolean): TypeDeclaredElsewhere; // Noncompliant
  constructor(b: boolean): void; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
declare class TypeDeclaredElsewhere {
  someMethod(): number;
  constructor(b: boolean);
}
----
