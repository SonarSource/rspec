== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript and TypeScript classes may define a `constructor` method that is executed when a new instance is created. TypeScript allows interfaces that describe a static class object to define a `new()` method.

This rule reports when:

* A class defines a method named `new`. The `new` keyword is used to create new instances of the class. If a method with the same name is defined, it can be unclear whether the method is intended to create new instances or perform some other action.
* An interface defines a method named `constructor`. The constructor method is used to define the constructor function for a class that implements the interface. If a method with the same name is defined in the interface, it can be unclear whether the method is intended to define the constructor function or perform some other action.

This rule helps to prevent confusion and ensure that the code is clear and easy to understand.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
interface I {
  constructor(): void; // Noncompliant
  new(): I;
}

declare class C {
  constructor();
  new(): C; // Noncompliant
}
----

Do not define methods named `constructor` on TypeScript interfaces. Similarly, avoid defining class methods called `new`.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
interface I {
  new(): I;
}

declare class C {
  constructor();
}
