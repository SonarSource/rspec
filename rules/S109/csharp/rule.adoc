== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public static void DoSomething() 
{
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)  // Noncompliant, 4 is a magic number
    {
        ...
    }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
private const int NUMBER_OF_CYCLES = 4;

public static void DoSomething()
{
    for(int i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_CYCLES ; i++)  //Compliant
    {
        ...
    }
}
----

=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an issue when the magic number is used as part of:

- the ``++GetHashCode++`` method
- a variable/field declaration
- the single argument of an attribute
- a named argument for a method or attribute
- a constructor call
