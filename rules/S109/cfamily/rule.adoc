A magic number is a number that comes out of nowhere, and is directly used in a statement. Magic numbers are often used, for instance to limit the number of iterations of a loops, to test the value of a property, etc.


Using magic numbers may seem obvious and straightforward when you're writing a piece of code, but they are much less obvious and straightforward at debugging time.


That is why magic numbers must be demystified by first being assigned a name. This is classically done by using a constant (``++constexpr++`` or ``++const++`` if your compiler does not support ``++constexpr++`` yet) or an enumeration.


-1, 0 and 1 are not considered magic numbers.


Note that since {cpp}20, some well known mathematical constants, such as pi, are defined in the headerÂ ``++<numbers>++``, and should be preferred over defining your own version (see S6164).

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void doSomething(int var) {
  for(int i = 0; i < 42; i++) { // Noncompliant - 42 is a magic number
    // ...
  }

  if (var == 42) { // Noncompliant - magic number
    // ...
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
enum Status {
STATUS_KO = 0,
STATUS_OK = 42,
};

void doSomething(Status var) {
  constexpr int maxIterations = 42; // Compliant - in a declaration
  for(int i = 0; i < maxIterations ; i++){ // Compliant: 0 is excluded, and maxIterations is a named constant
    // ...
  }

  if (STATUS_OK == var) { // Compliant - number comes from an enum
    // ...
  }
}
