This rule raises an issue when using an ``++assert++`` statement on a tuple literal.

== Why is this an issue?

Using the ``++assert++`` statement on a tuple literal will always fail if the tuple is empty, and always succeed otherwise.


The ``++assert++`` statement does not take parentheses around its parameters. Calling ``++assert(x, y)++`` will test if the tuple ``++(x, y)++`` is True, which is always the case.

== How to fix it

There are two possible fixes:

* If your intention is to test the first value of the tuple and use the second value as a message, simply remove the parentheses.
* If your intention is to check that every element of the tuple is ``++True++``, test each value separately.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
def test_values(a, b):
    assert (a, b)  # Noncompliant: will always be True
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
def test_values(a, b):
    # If you mean to test "a" and use "b" as an error message
    assert a, b

    # If you mean to test the values of "a" and "b"
    assert a and b
----
