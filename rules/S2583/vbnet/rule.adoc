== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

In the case below, the call of `Dispose()` never happens.

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim a = False

If a Then
    Dispose() ' Never reached
End If
----

=== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:

* When the condition is a single `const bool`

[source,vbnet]
----
Const debug = False
'...
If debug Then
    ' Print something
End If
----
* When the condition is the literal `true` or `false`.

In these cases, it is obvious the code is as intended.

== How to fix it

The conditions should be reviewed to decide whether:

* to update the condition or
* to remove the condition.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Sub Sample(ByVal b As Boolean)
    Dim a = False
    If a Then                   ' Noncompliant: The true branch is never reached
        DoSomething()           ' Never reached
    End If

    If Not a OrElse b Then      ' Noncompliant: "not a" is always "True" and the false branch is never reached
        DoSomething()
    Else
        DoSomethingElse()       ' Never reached
    End If

    Dim c = "xxx"
    Dim res = If(c, "value")    ' Noncompliant: d is always not Nothing, "value" is never used
End Sub
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Sub Sample(ByVal b As Boolean)
    Dim a = False
    If Foo(a) Then             ' Condition was updated
        DoSomething()
    End If

    If b Then                  ' Parts of the condition were removed.
        DoSomething()
    Else
        DoSomethingElse()
    End If

    Dim c = "xxx"
    Dim res = c                ' "value" was removed
End Sub

* Change this condition so that it does not always evaluate to "[true|false]". Some code paths are unreachable.
* Change this expression which always evaluates to the same result. Some code paths are unreachable.
