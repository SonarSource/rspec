== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:

* When the condition is a single ``++const++`` of boolean value

----
const debug = false;
//...
if (debug) {
  // Print something
}
----

* When the condition is the literal ``++0++``, ``++1++``, ``++true++`` or ``++false++``.

In these cases it is obvious the code is as intended.
