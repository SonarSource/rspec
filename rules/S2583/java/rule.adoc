== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:

* When the condition is a single ``++final boolean++``

----
final boolean debug = false;
//...
if (debug) {
  // Print something
}
----

* When the condition is literally ``++true++`` or ``++false++``.

----
if (true) {
  // do something
}
----

In these cases it is obvious the code is as intended.
