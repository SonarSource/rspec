== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:

* When the condition is a single `const bool`
+
[source,csharp]
----
const bool debug = false;
//...
if (debug)
{
  // Print something
}
----
* When the condition is the literal `true` or `false`.

In these cases, it is obvious the code is as intended.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public void Sample(bool b)
{
    bool a = false;
    if (a)                  // Noncompliant: The true branch is never reached
    {
        DoSomething();      // Never reached
    }

    if (!a || b)            // Noncompliant: "!a" is always "true" and the false branch is never reached
    {
        DoSomething();
    }
    else
    {
        DoSomethingElse();  // Never reached
    }

    var d = "xxx";
    var res = d ?? "value"; // Noncompliant: d is always not null, "value" is never used
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public void Sample(bool b)
{
    bool a = false;
    if (Foo(a))
    {
        DoSomething();
    }

    if (b)
    {
        DoSomething();
    }
    else
    {
        DoSomethingElse();
    }

    var d = "xxx";
    var res = d;
}

=== Message

* Change this condition so that it does not always evaluate to "[true|false]"; some subsequent code is never executed.
* Change this expression which always evaluates to "not null"; some subsequent code is never executed.
