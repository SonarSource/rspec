== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}17 introduced `std::byte`. It allows you to have byte-oriented access to memory in a type-safe, unambiguous manner. Before, you had to use either ``++char++``, ``++signed char++``, or ``++unsigned char++`` to access memory as bytes. The previous approach was error-prone as the ``++char++`` type allows you to accidentally perform arithmetic operations. Also, it was confusing since ``++char++``, ``++signed char++``, and ``++unsigned char++`` are also used to represent actual characters and arithmetic values.


``++std::byte++`` is simply a scoped enumeration with bit-wise operators and a helper function ``++to_integer<T>++`` to convert byte object to integral type T.

This rule will detect byte-like usage of ``++char++``, ``++signed char++``, and ``++unsigned char++`` and suggest replacing them by ``++std::byte++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void handleFirstByte(char* byte);

void f(int* i) {
  char* c = reinterpret_cast<char*>(i); // Noncompliant
  handleFirstByte(c);
}

unsigned char negate(unsigned char byte) {
  return ~byte; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void handleFirstByte(std::byte* byte);

void f(int* i) {
  std::byte* byte = reinterpret_cast<std::byte*>(i); // Compliant
  handleFirstByte(byte);
}

std::byte negate(std::byte byte) {
  return ~byte; // Compliant
}
