== Why is this an issue?

The behavior is undefined when `memcpy`, `memmove`, or `memset` are invoked with objects of non-trivially copyable types.

include::../../../shared_content/cfamily/trivially_copyable_types.adoc[]

== How to fix it

`memcpy`, `memmove`, and `memset` should only be called on trivially-copyable objects.
Fixing this code defect may require non-trivial refactoring, as illustrated in the following example.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

Here, `copy` is incorrect because it calls `memcpy` on non-trivial objects.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Resource {
  Handle* resource_handle;

public:
  Resource() {
    // Acquire the resource handle.
  }

  ~Resource() {
    // Release the resource handle.
  }
};

void copy(Resource* dest, Resource const* source) {
  memcpy(dest, source, sizeof(Resource)); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Instead, the `Resource` class can provide a copy assignment operator.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Resource {
  Handle* resource_handle;

public:
  Resource() {
    // Acquire the resource handle.
  }

  ~Resource() {
    // Release the resource handle.
  }

  Resource& operator=(Resource const& other) {
    // Non-trivial copy assignement:
    // copy the handle and update the reference count, etc...
  }
};

void copy(Resource* dest, Resource const* source) {
  (*dest) = (*source);
}
----

Use constructors or assignment operators, XXX is not trivially copyable.
