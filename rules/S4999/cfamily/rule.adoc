== Why is this an issue?

The functions ``++memcpy++``, ``++memmove++`` and ``++memset++`` can only be used for objects of trivially copyable types. This includes scalar types, arrays, and trivially copyable classes.


A class type is trivially copyable if:

* One or more of the following special member functions is trivial and the rest are deleted: copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator, 
* It has a trivial, non-deleted destructor,
* It has trivially copyable members and base classes,
* It has no virtual functions.

_Note: a default implementation, both explicit (with ``++=default++``) or implicit (if the special member function is omitted), is considered trivial._


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class Shape {
public:
  int x;
  int y;
  virtual ~Shape(); // This makes the class non trivially copyable
};

void f(Shape *dest, Shape *source)
{
    memcpy(dest, source, sizeof Shape); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class Shape {
public:
  int x;
  int y;
  virtual ~Shape(); // This makes the class non trivially copyable
};

void f(Shape *dest, Shape *source)
{
    (*dest) = (*source);
}
----
