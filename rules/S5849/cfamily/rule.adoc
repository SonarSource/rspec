Setting capabilities can lead to privilege escalation.

Linux capabilities allow you to assign narrow slices of ``++root++``'s permissions to files or processes. A thread with capabilities bypasses the normal kernel security checks to execute high-privilege actions such as mounting a device to a directory, without requiring (additional) root privileges.


== Ask Yourself Whether

Capabilities are granted:

* To a process that does not require all capabilities to do its job.
* To a not trusted process.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Capabilities are high privileges, traditionally associated with superuser (root), thus make sure that the most restrictive and necessary capabilities are assigned to files and processes.


== Sensitive Code Example

When setting capabilities:

[source,c]
----
cap_t caps = cap_init();
cap_value_t cap_list[2];
cap_list[0] = CAP_FOWNER;
cap_list[1] = CAP_CHOWN;
cap_set_flag(caps, CAP_PERMITTED, 2, cap_list, CAP_SET);

cap_set_file("file", caps); // Sensitive
cap_set_fd(fd, caps); // Sensitive
cap_set_proc(caps); // Sensitive
capsetp(pid, caps); // Sensitive
capset(hdrp, datap); // Sensitive: is discouraged to be used because it is a system call
----

When setting SUID/SGID attributes:

[source,c]
----
chmod("file", S_ISUID|S_ISGID); // Sensitive
fchmod(fd, S_ISUID|S_ISGID); // Sensitive
----

\[~hendrik.buchwald] this description would benefit from a little background on what capabilities are. I've been using Linux for a long time & this is my first exposure.
