<h2 id="_description">Description</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Dockerfiles, hard-coded secrets and secrets passed through as variables or
created at build-time will cause security risks. The secret information can be
exposed either via the container environment, the image metadata, or the build
environment logs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequences vary greatly depending on the situation and the secret-exposed
audience. Still, two main scenarios should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application&#8217;s
users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_applications_security_downgrade">Application&#8217;s security downgrade</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect
security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the
affected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive
information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting server
or another linked component.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user
authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation. An
attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary
users and take over their privileges and entitlements.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Best practices recommend using a secret vault for all secrets that must be
accessed at container runtime. This will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and
prevent any further unexpected disclosure. Depending on the development platform
and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For all secrets that must be accessed at image build time, it is recommended to
rely on Docker Buildkit&#8217;s secret mount options. This will prevent secrets from
being disclosed in image&#8217;s metadata and build logs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, investigations and remediation actions should be conducted to
ensure the current and future security of the infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>

<p>For runtime secrets, best practices recommend relying on a vault service to
pass secret information to the containers. Docker environment provides Swarm
services that implement such a feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If such an option can not be considered, store the runtime secrets in an
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/">environment file</a> such as <code>.env</code> and
then start the container with the
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#env"><code>--env-file</code></a> argument:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-docker" data-lang="docker">docker run --env-file .env myImage</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is then important to ensure that the environment files are securely stored
and generated.</p>
