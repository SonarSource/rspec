Sensitive data has been found in the Dockerfile or Docker image. The data
should be considered breached.

If malicious third parties can get a hold of such information, they could
impersonate legitimate identities within the organization. +
It is a clear breach of trust in the system, as the systems involved falsely 
assume that the authenticated entity is who it claims to be. +
The consequences can be catastrophic.

In Dockerfiles, secrets hard-coded, secrets passed through as variables or
created at build-time will cause security risks. The secret information can be
exposed either via the container environment itself, the image metadata or the
build environment logs.

Docker Buildkit's secret mount options should be used when secrets have to be
accessed at build time. For run-time secrets, best practices would recommend
only setting them at runtime, for example with the `--env` option of the docker
run command.

Note that files exposing the secrets should be securely stored and not exposed
to a large sphere. If possible, use a secret vault or another similar
component. For example, *Docker Swarm* provides a *secrets* service that can be
used to handle most confidential data.
