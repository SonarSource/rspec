A hard-coded secret has been found in the Dockerfile or Docker image. The
secret should be revoked as soon as possible.

If malicious third parties can get a hold of such secret, they can impersonate
legitimate identities and undermine trust within the organization. +
It is a clear breach of trust in the system, as the systems involved falsely
assume that the authenticated entity is who it claims to be. +
The consequences can be catastrophic.

In Dockerfiles, both secrets hard-coded and secrets passed through as
build-time variables will cause security risks. The secret
information can be exposed either via Dockerfile disclosure, in the image metadata
or the build environment logs.

Docker Buildkit's secret mount options should be used when secrets have to be
accessed at build time. Note that the files exposing the secrets should be
securely stored and not exposed to a large sphere. If possible, use a
secret vault or another similar component. For example,
*Docker Swarm* provides a *secrets* service that can be used to handle most
confidential data.
