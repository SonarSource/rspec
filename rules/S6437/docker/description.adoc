A hard-coded secret has been found in your Dockerfile or Docker image. You should quickly
list where this secret is used, revoke it, and then change it in every system
that uses it.

If you allow third parties to get a hold of such secret, they
can impersonate legitimate identities and undermine trust within the
organization. +
It does not matter if the impersonation is malicious: In either case, it is a
clear breach of trust in the system, as the systems involved falsely assume
that the authenticated entity is who it claims to be. +
The consequences can be catastrophic.

Hard-coded secrets or secrets passed using build-time variables to propagate
configuration entries that contain secrets causes a security risk. The secret
information can happen either via Dockerfile disclosure, in the image metadata
or the build environment logs.

Docker Buildkit's secret mount options should be used when secrets have to be
acessed at build time. Note that, the files exposing the secrets should be
securely stored and not exposed to a large sphere. If possible, use a
secret vault or another similar component. For example,
*Docker Swarm* provides a *secrets* service that can be used to handle most
confidential data.
