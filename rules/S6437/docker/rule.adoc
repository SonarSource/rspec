== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

In Dockerfiles, hard-coded secrets and secrets passed through as variables or
created at build-time will cause security risks. The secret information can be
exposed either via the container environment, the image metadata, or the build
environment logs.

== How to fix it

Best practices recommend using a secret vault for all secrets that must be
accessed at container runtime. This will ensure the secret's security and
prevent any further unexpected disclosure. Depending on the development platform
and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.

For all secrets that must be accessed at image build time, it is recommended to
rely on Docker Buildkit's secret mount options. This will prevent secrets from
being disclosed in image's metadata and build logs.

Additionally, investigations and remediation actions should be conducted to
ensure the current and future security of the infrastructure.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

The following code sample generates a new SSH private key that will be stored in
the generated image. This key should be considered as compromised. Moreover, the
SSH key encryption passphrase is also hardcoded.

[source,docker, diff-id=1, diff-type=noncompliant]
----
FROM example

# Noncompliant
RUN ssh-keygen -N "passphrase" -t rsa -b 2048 -f /etc/ssh/rsa_key

RUN /example.sh --ssh /etc/ssh/rsa_key
----

The following code sample uses a seemingly hidden password which is actually
leaked in the image metadata after the build.

[source,docker, diff-id=2, diff-type=noncompliant]
----
FROM example
ARG PASSWORD

# Noncompliant
RUN wget --user=guest --password="$PASSWORD" https://example.com
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
FROM example

RUN --mount=type=secret,id=ssh,target=/etc/ssh/rsa_key \
    /example.sh --ssh /etc/ssh/rsa_key
----

[source,docker,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
FROM example

RUN --mount=type=secret,id=wget,target=/home/user/.wgetrc \
    wget --user=guest https://example.com
----

For runtime secrets, best practices recommend relying on a vault service to
pass secret information to the containers. Docker environment provides Swarm
services that implement such a feature.

If such an option can not be considered, store the runtime secrets in an
https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/[environment file] such as `.env` and
then start the container with the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file[`--env-file`] argument:

[source,docker]
----
docker run --env-file .env myImage
----

It is then important to ensure that the environment files are securely stored
and generated.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message
For secret generation:
* Change this code not to store a secret in the image.

For hardcoded secrets:
* Revoke and change this secret, as it might be compromised.

=== Highlighting

For literals and variable expansions:
* Highlight the command argument, whether a string literal or a variable expansion. If a variable, highlight as second location the ARG instruction.
For secret generation:
* Highlight the entire secret generation command
