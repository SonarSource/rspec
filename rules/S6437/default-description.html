<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequences vary greatly depending on the situation and the secret-exposed
audience. Still, two main scenarios should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application&#8217;s
users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_applications_security_downgrade">Application&#8217;s security downgrade</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect
security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the
affected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive
information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting server
or another linked component.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user
authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation. An
attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary
users and take over their privileges and entitlements.</p>

<h3 id="_how_does_this_work">How does this work?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the noncompliant code example contains a hard-coded password, the compliant solution retrieves the secret&#8217;s value externally. This avoids storing the password in the source code and allows the password to be different depending on the environment the code runs in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several methods can be used to retrieve the secret value externally. Ansible offers a built-in solution called Ansible Vault. Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt sensitive data and store it in a file. This encrypted file can then be used in your playbooks.</p>
