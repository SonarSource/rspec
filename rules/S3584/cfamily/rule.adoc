== Why is this an issue?

Memory allocated dynamically with ``++calloc(...)++``, ``++malloc(...)++``, ``++realloc(...)++`` or ``++new++`` should be released when it's not needed anymore. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak that could bring the box to its knees.


This rule raises an issue when memory is allocated and not freed in the same function. Allocated memory is ignored if a pointer to it is ``++return++``ed to the caller or stored in a structure that's external to the function.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int fun() {
  char* name = (char *) malloc (size);
  if (!name) {
    return 1;
  }
  // ...
  return 0; // Noncompliant, memory pointed by "name" has not been released
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int fun() {
  char* name = (char *) malloc (size);
  if (!name) {
    return 1;
  }
  // ...
  free(name);
  return 0;
}
----

=== Message

Review the data-flow; this memory allocation might not have been released when reaching exit point at line ``++line++``.

* Primary: the allocation call - [m|c|re]alloc|new

\[~massimo.paladin] I've expanded the description, and added an "issue raised when" section. It describes what seems like a reasonable scope for the rule, but may not match the scope you had in mind. 


Also, I've greatly expanded the references section based on the standards' titles.
