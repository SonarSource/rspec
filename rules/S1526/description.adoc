	Variables declared with ``var`` have the special property that regardless of where they're declared in a function they "float" to the top of the function and are available for use even before they're declared. That makes scoping confusing, especially for new coders. To keep confusion to a minimum, ``var`` declarations should happen before the variables they declare are used for the first time.
