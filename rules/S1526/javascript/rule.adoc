Variables declared with `+var+` have the special property that regardless of where they're declared in a function they "float" to the top of the function and are available for use even before they're declared. That makes scoping confusing, especially for new coders. 
To keep confusion to a minimum, `+var+` declarations should happen before they are used for the first time.
