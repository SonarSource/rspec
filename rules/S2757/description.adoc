The use of operators pairs ( ``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, or ``++=!++`` ) that look like reversed single operators (``+++=++``, ``++-=++`` or ``++!=++``) is confusing. They compile and run, but do not produce the same result as their mirrored counterpart.

include::{example}[]

This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, or ``++=!++`` are used without any space between the operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.
