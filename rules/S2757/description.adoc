Using operator pairs (``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, or ``++=!++``) that look like reversed single operators (``+++=++``, ``++-=++`` or ``++!=++``) is confusing. They compile and run but do not produce the same result as their mirrored counterpart.

This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, or ``++=!++`` are used without any space between the operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.
