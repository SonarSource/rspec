The use of operators pairs (``++=+++``, ``++=-++`` or ``++=!++``) where the reversed, single operator was meant (``+++=++``, ``++-=++`` or ``++!=++``) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.
In the same way, the usage of non-null assertion in front of assignments or comparators (``++! =++``, ``++! ==++`` or ``++! ===++``) can be too easily confused with a negative comparison.


This rule raises an issue when:
* ``++=+++``, ``++=-++`` and ``++=!++`` are used without any space between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.
* ``++! =++``, ``++! ==++`` and ``++! ===++`` are used with a space between the two operators.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let target =-5;
let num = 3;

target =- num;  // Noncompliant; target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num; // Noncompliant; target = 3
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let target = -5;
let num = 3;

target = -num;  // Compliant; intent to assign inverse value of num is clear
target += num;
----

== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let foo: number
foo = bar! = 12;

if (foo! == bar) { // Noncompliant; Is that really what's meant?
  // ...
}
if (foo! === bar) { // Noncompliant; Is that really what's meant?
  // ...
}
----
