== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,go]
----
var target, num = -5, 3

target =- num  // Noncompliant; target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num // Noncompliant; target = 3
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,go]
----
var target, num = -5, 3

target = -num  // Compliant; intent to assign inverse value of num is clear
target += num
