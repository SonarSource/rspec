== Why is this an issue?

Using operator pairs (``++=+++`` or ``++=-++``) that look like reversed single operators (``+++=++`` or ``++-=++``) is confusing. They compile and run but do not produce the same result as their mirrored counterpart.

[source,python]
----
target = -5
num = 3

target =- num  # Noncompliant: target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num # Noncompliant: target = 3
----

This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++`` or ``++=-++`` are used without any space between the operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.

Replace the operators with a single one if that is the intention

[source,python]
----
target = -5
num = 3

target -= num  # target = -8
----

Or fix the spacing to avoid confusion

[source,python]
----
target = -5
num = 3

target = -num  #  target = -3
----
