== Why is this an issue?

The use of operators pairs ( ``++=+++`` or ``++=-++`` ) that look like reversed single operators (``+++=++`` or ``++-=++``) is confusing. They compile and run, but do not produce the same result as their mirrored counterpart.

[source,python]
----
target = -5
num = 3

target =- num  # Noncompliant: target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num # Noncompliant: target = 3
----

This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++`` or ``++=-++`` are used without any space between the operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.
