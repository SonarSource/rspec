The use of operators pairs (``++=+++``) where the reversed, single operator was meant (``+++=++``) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.


This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, ``++=!++``, ``++=&++``, ``++=*++``, ``{plus}={plus}``,  and ``++-=-++`` are used without any space between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.
