== Why is this an issue?

Using operator pairs (e.g., ``++=+++``) that look like reversed single operators (e.g., ``+++=++``) is confusing. They compile and run but do not produce the same result as their mirrored counterpart.

include::../common/code-example.adoc[]

This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, ``++=!++``, ``++=&++``, ``++=*++``, ``{plus}={plus}``,  and ``++-=-++`` are used without any space between the operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.
