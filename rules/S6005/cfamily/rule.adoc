``{cpp}17`` introduced structured binding, a syntax that initializes multiple entities by elements or members of an object. It is especially useful to emulate multiple return values from a function.


Suppose you have a function that returns a pair:

----
std::pair<std::string, std::string> getPair();
----
Structured binding allows you to bind the members of the ``++std::pair++`` class directly to new names:

----
auto [firstName, lastName] = getPair();
----
The names ``++firstName++`` and ``++lastName++`` are called structured bindings. As you can see, structured binding makes the code more readable as they allow binding values to names that carry information about their purpose.


Structured binding works with:

*  Raw arrays, by binding a name to each element
*  Any type that has a tuple-like API
*  Classes and structures where all non-static data member are publicly accessible

This rule will detect places where ``++std::pair++`` and ``++std::tuple++`` can be effortlessly replaced by a structured binding.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
void printingMap(const std::map<int, std::string>& map) {
  for (const auto& elem : map) { // Noncompliant
    std::cout << elem.first << ": " << elem.second << "\n";
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
void printingMap(const std::map<int, std::string>& map) {
  for (const auto& [key, value] : map) { // Compliant
    std::cout << key << ": " << value << "\n";
  }
}
----
