== Why is this an issue?

In the event of a system failure, application logs may be your only method of untangling what happened. However, if you log user input verbatim, your logs may not be entirely reliable: a malicious user could use specially crafted inputs to insert false log entries or otherwise corrupt the logs' accurate use by log processing applications or manual audit.


=== Noncompliant code example

----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
  LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, request.getParameter("user"));  // Noncompliant
  // ...

}
