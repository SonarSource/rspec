In a Large Language Model conversation, different roles have a clear hierarchy
and have distinctly different abilities to influence the conversation, define
its boundaries, and control the actions of other participants.

Nowadays, the trio of `system`, `user`, and `assistant` defining the core
roles of many Large Language Model (LLM) interactions is expanding to include
a more diverse set of roles, such as developer, tool, function, and even more
nuanced roles in multi-agent systems.

Injecting unchecked user input in privileged prompts, such as `system`, gives
unauthorized third parties the ability to break out of contexts and constraints
that you assume the LLM follows.
