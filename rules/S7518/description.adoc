In a Large Language Model conversation, different roles have a clear hierarchy
and have distinctly different abilities to influence the conversation, define
its boundaries, and control the actions of other participants.

Injecting unchecked user inputs in privileged prompts gives unauthorized third
parties the ability to break out of contexts and constraints that you assume the
LLM will follow.

Fundamentally, the core roles of many Large Language Model (LLM) interactions is
defined by the trio of `system`, `user`, and `assistant`. However, the landscape
of conversational AI is expanding to include a more diverse set of roles, such
as `developer`, `tool`, `function`, and even more nuanced roles in multi-agent
systems.

In essence, the LLM conversation roles are no longer a simple triad, but the
most important to keep in mind is that these roles must stay coherent to the
least privilege principle, where each role has the minimum level of access
necessary to perform its function.
