This rule raises an issue when C memory allocations (such as `C.CString`) are not freed with `C.free`, when `defer` is not used for cleanup, or when C function return values are ignored.

== Why is this an issue?

When using Cgo to interface with C code, Go's garbage collector does not manage memory allocated by C functions. This creates two critical problems:

First, C memory allocations like `C.CString` must be manually freed using `C.free`. Without proper cleanup, these allocations create memory leaks that accumulate over time. In long-running applications, this can lead to steadily increasing memory usage and eventual resource exhaustion.

Second, C functions often return error codes or status values that indicate success or failure. Ignoring these return values means your application cannot detect when C operations fail, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential data corruption.

The `defer` statement is particularly important in Cgo because it ensures cleanup happens even if the function exits early due to errors, panics, or early returns. Without `defer`, memory can be leaked when execution doesn't reach the cleanup code.

=== What is the potential impact?

Memory leaks from unfreed C allocations can cause applications to consume increasing amounts of memory over time, potentially leading to out-of-memory conditions and application crashes. Ignored C function errors can result in silent failures, data corruption, or unpredictable application behavior. In server applications, these issues can lead to service degradation or denial of service.

== How to fix it

Always free C memory allocations using `C.free` and use `defer` to ensure cleanup happens even if the function exits early. Check return values from C functions and handle errors appropriately.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
func Print(s string) {
    cs := C.CString(s)
    C.fputs(cs, (*C.FILE)(C.stdout))
    // Noncompliant: cs is never freed
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
func Print(s string) {
    cs := C.CString(s)
    defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(cs))
    C.fputs(cs, (*C.FILE)(C.stdout))
}
----
