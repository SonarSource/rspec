==== URL-encoding

A common method to mitigate path traversal SSRF attacks involves URL-encoding
user input prior to its incorporation into a URL. URL-encoding, or
percent-encoding, is a technique used to encode certain information within a
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This is achieved by transforming potentially
malicious characters, such as `../`, into a safe encoded format that can be
safely included in a URL without modifying the intended path.

However, it is crucial to note that simply encoding the user input might not be
sufficient in all cases due to varying behaviors of different servers.
Therefore, it is recommended to move the dynamic, user-controlled input from the
actual path of the URL to the query string, if possible. This further reduces
the risk of path traversal, as the query string is less likely to be
misinterpreted by the server as a directory traversal command.
