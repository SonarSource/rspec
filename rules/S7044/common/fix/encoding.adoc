==== URL-encoding

One common and effective way to prevent path traversal SSRF attacks is by
URL-encoding user input before using it as part of a URL. URL-encoding, also
known as percent-encoding, is a mechanism for encoding information in a
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) under certain circumstances.

In the context of preventing path traversal SSRF attacks, URL-encoding can be
used to ensure that any user-supplied input is safely incorporated into a URL.
This works by converting potentially harmful characters, such as `../`, into a
safe format that can be included in a URL without altering the intended path.
