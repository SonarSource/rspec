A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack is a security vulnerability that
allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests
to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing. However, in a path traversal
SSRF attack, the attacker only controls the path of the URL.

In the context of SSRF, path traversal attacks can be used to alter the request
path of the server-side request, potentially accessing unauthorized endpoints or
data. This type of attack is particularly dangerous if the server-side
application can be manipulated to send requests to internal resources that are
not normally accessible to an external attacker.
