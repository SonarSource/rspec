A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a security vulnerability that allows an
attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an
arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing. However, in a path traversal SSRF
attack, the attacker only controls the path of the URL.

Path traversal attacks can be used to alter the request path of the server-side
request, potentially accessing unauthorized endpoints or data. This type of
attack is particularly dangerous if the server-side application can be
manipulated to send requests to internal resources that are not normally
accessible to an external attacker.
