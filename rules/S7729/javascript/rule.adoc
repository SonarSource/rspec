This rule raises an issue when array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `find()`, etc. are called with a `thisArg` parameter.

== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript array methods accept an optional `thisArg` parameter that sets the `this` context for the callback function. However, using this parameter often leads to confusion and less readable code.

There are several problems with using `thisArg`:

**Arrow functions ignore `thisArg`**: Arrow functions don't have their own `this` context and cannot be bound to a different `this` value. When you pass a `thisArg` with an arrow function, it has no effect, making the code misleading.

**Regular functions become less explicit**: When using regular functions with `thisArg`, the relationship between the callback and the context object becomes less clear. Readers must understand that the second parameter affects the `this` binding inside the callback.

**Better alternatives exist**: Modern JavaScript provides clearer ways to access external values in callbacks. You can directly reference variables from the outer scope, use explicit binding with `.bind()`, or restructure the code to avoid `this` altogether.

Using `thisArg` makes code harder to understand and maintain, especially for developers who may not be familiar with JavaScript's complex `this` binding rules.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `thisArg` unnecessarily can lead to:

* **Bugs**: When arrow functions are used with `thisArg`, developers might expect the `this` binding to work, but it doesn't
* **Confusion**: Code becomes harder to read and understand, especially for team members less familiar with JavaScript's `this` behavior
* **Maintenance issues**: Future modifications might break the intended `this` binding without clear indication

=== How to fix?


Remove the unnecessary `thisArg` parameter when using arrow functions, since arrow functions ignore the `this` binding.
