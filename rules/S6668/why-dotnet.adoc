== Why is this an issue?

Most logging frameworks have methods that take a log level, an event ID or an exception as a separate input next to the log format and its arguments. There is a high chance that if the log level, the event ID or the exception are passed as the arguments to the message format, it was a mistake. This rule is going to raise in that scenario.

The rule covers the following logging frameworks:

* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Castle.Core[Castle.Core]
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Serilog[Serilog]
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLog[Nlog]
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging[Microsoft.Extensions.Logging]

=== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue if one of the parameters mentioned above is passed as a separate argument to the invocation and as an argument to the message format.
