This rule raises an issue when `process.exit()` is called directly in Node.js code.

== Why is this an issue?

The `process.exit()` method immediately terminates the Node.js process without giving the application a chance to handle errors gracefully. This can cause data loss, prevent cleanup operations, and make debugging difficult.

When `process.exit()` is called, the application stops abruptly at that point, regardless of any ongoing operations or error handling mechanisms that might be in place. This prevents proper error propagation and recovery strategies.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `process.exit()` can lead to:

* Data loss from incomplete operations
* Resource leaks from unclosed connections or files
* Difficulty in debugging and error tracking
* Poor user experience due to abrupt application termination

=== How to fix?


Instead of calling `process.exit()`, throw an error to allow proper error handling and graceful shutdown.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (somethingBadHappened) {
    console.error("Something bad happened!");
    process.exit(1); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (somethingBadHappened) {
    throw new Error("Something bad happened!");
}
