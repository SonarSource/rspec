<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>process.exit()</code> method immediately stops the Node.js process and exits. This is problematic because it can occur at any point in the application, completely stopping execution when an error occurs without giving other parts of the application a chance to handle the error gracefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <code>process.exit()</code> is called, the application cannot perform cleanup operations, handle the error appropriately, or allow error handlers to process the issue. This makes debugging more difficult and can lead to unexpected application termination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better approach is to throw an error and let the application&#8217;s error handling mechanisms deal with it. If the error bubbles up to the process level without being handled, the process will still exit with a non-zero exit code, but other parts of the application have had the opportunity to respond.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using <code>process.exit()</code> can lead to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abrupt application termination without proper cleanup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of error context and debugging information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability for other parts of the application to handle or recover from errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficulty in testing and maintaining the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential data loss if cleanup operations are not performed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A node process will end naturally when all handlers/listerners have been shutdown. As node.js is an event-driven runtime the most graceful exit is to exhaust the queue of pending events. When the event queue is empty the process will end. You can ensure the event queue is drained by doing things such as clearing any interval timers that are set and by closing down any servers with open socket connections. Closing with process.exit() is not graceful
=== How to fix?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Replace <code>process.exit()</code> calls with thrown errors to allow proper error handling.</p>
