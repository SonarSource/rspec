== Why is this an issue?

The <label> tag defines a label for an <input> element.


The <label> element does not render as anything special for the user. However, it provides a usability improvement for mouse users, because if the user clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control.


The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the related element to bind them together.
