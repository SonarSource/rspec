* Message: in my experience, structs are often defined in headers, so it may not be a matter of completing so much as providing, i.e. adding the header include that contains the definition
* Are you sure this is Maintainability? Can bad things happen if the struct definition is not available in the translation unit?

* It is a good practice to define a type only once in a header, but this is not the scope of this rule.
* Incomplete types (known as opaque types) can exist and can be used as long as you don't need to know their size or to access a field. Nothing bad can happen. You will only get compile time error if you try to allocate a space for them or try to access a field, so maintenance is fine for me.
