== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++std::bind++`` or ``++boost::bind++`` allows to create a wrapper to a function where some arguments are bound to fixed values, or the order of arguments is changed. However, this way of wrapping a function comes with some issues:

* The code is not really clear, the usage of placeholders makes it difficult to follow,
* The complexity of the implementation of ``++std::bind++`` often results in sub-optimal code,
* The possibilities offered by ``++bind++`` are limited, for instance, it's not possible to bind a function with variable arguments,
* ``++bind++`` allows to silently discard some arguments, which is often not what was expected,
* Fixed arguments are evaluated when ``++bind++`` is called, not when the bound function is called, which might be surprising in some cases,
* ``++bind++`` requires to take the address of a function, which can be difficult (if the function is overloaded) or not recommended (for standard library functions, see S5180).

To create such a wrapper, it is usually better to:

* either write a simple lambda that just calls the wrapped function with the full power of the language concerning how the arguments are going to be tinkered with.
* or, if the function ``++bind++`` is only applied to the first arguments, call ``++std::bind_front++`` that has been introduced in {cpp}20 and that is safer to use and a simpler replacement than lambdas.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr int multiply(int a, int b) {return a*b;}
auto flipMultiplication = std::bind(multiply, std::placeholders::_2, std::placeholders::_1); // Noncompliant
int i = flipMultiplication (6, 7);

struct Logger {
    string subsystem;
    template <class T>
    void operator()(T const &what) {  cout << subsystem << ": " << what << "\n"; }
};

void f(){
    Logger net {"network"};
    // Noncompliant in C++14, compliant by exception in C++11 because it would require a polymorphic lambda
    auto networkLog = bind(net, _1);
    networkLog(4);
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr int multiply(int a, int b) {return a*b;}
auto flipMultiplication = [](int a, int b) {return multiply(b, a);}; // Compliant
int i2 = flipMultiplication (6, 7);

void f(){
    Logger net {"network"};
    auto networkLog = [&](auto what) {net(what);}; // Compliant
    networkLog(4);
}{code}

----

=== Exceptions

Before {cpp}14 lambda was limited and could not capture by move or be polymorphic. Therefore, if the call to ``++bind++`` makes use of those features, it will not be reported in {cpp}11.
