1) To avoid these issues and improve the performance of the application, it's recommended to declare a local variable to store a single `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` value and use it throughout the code block.

2) Instead of `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset`, it's recommended to use `Stopwatch`, which automatically checks for the existence of high-precision timers. The `StopWatch` class is lightweight, computationally faster and not affected by DST.
