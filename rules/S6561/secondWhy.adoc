2) When using repeated calls to `DateTime.Now` or `DateTime.UtcNow` to measure elapsed time is not recommended because it's dependent on the system clock, which may have low resolution on older systems (as low as 15 milliseconds). 
Moreover, `DateTime.Now` and `DateTimeOffset.Now` are subject to Daylight Savings Time (DST), which can cause issues if a DST transition occurs during the benchmark session.
