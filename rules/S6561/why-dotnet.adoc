== Why is this an issue?

Using repeated calls to `DateTime.Now` to measure elapsed time is not recommended since this property is subject to changes such as daylight savings transitions, which can invalidate the calculation if the change occurs during the benchmark session.
Moreover, `DateTime.Now` is dependent on the system clock, which may have low resolution on older systems (as low as 15 milliseconds).
