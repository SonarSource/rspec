== How to fix it

=== Code examples

If the purpose is to benchmark something then, instead of the `DateTime.Now` property, it's recommended to use `Stopwatch`, which is not affected by changes in time such as daylight savings (DST) and automatically checks for the existence of high-precision timers. As a bonus, the `StopWatch` class is also lightweight and computationally faster than `DateTime`.

If, on the other hand, the goal is to refresh a timer prefer using the `DateTime.UtcNow` property, which guarantees reliable results when doing arithmetic operations during DST transitions.
