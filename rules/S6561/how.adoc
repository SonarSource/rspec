Instead of the `DateTime.Now` property, it's recommended to use `Stopwatch`, which is not affected by changes in time such as daylight savings (DST) and automatically checks for the existence of high-precision timers. As a bonus, the `StopWatch` class is also lightweight and computationally faster than `DateTime`.
