Using repeated calls to `DateTime.Now` to measure elapsed time is not recommended since this property is subject to Daylight Savings Time (DST), which can cause issues if a DST transition occurs during the benchmark session.
Moreover, `DateTime.Now` is dependent on the system clock, which may have low resolution on older systems (as low as 15 milliseconds).
