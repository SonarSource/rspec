When using ``++sprintf++`` , it's up to the developer to make sure the size of the buffer to be written to is large enough to avoid buffer overflows. Buffer overflows can cause the program to crash at a minimum. At worst, a carefully crafted overflow can cause malicious code to be executed.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* if the provided buffer is large enough for the result of any possible call to the ``++sprintf++`` function (including all possible format strings and all possible additional arguments).

There is a risk if you answered no to the above question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

There are fundamentally safer alternatives. ``++snprintf++`` is one of them. It takes the size of the buffer as an additional argument, preventing the function from overflowing the buffer.

* Use ``++snprintf++`` instead of ``++sprintf++``. The slight performance overhead can be afforded in a vast majority of projects.
* Check the buffer size passed to ``++snprintf++``.

If you are working in {cpp}, other safe alternative exist:

* ``++std::string++`` should be the prefered type to store strings
* You can format to a string using ``++std::ostringstream++``
* Since {cpp}20, ``++std::format++`` is also available to format strings


== Sensitive Code Example

----
sprintf(str, "%s", message);   // Sensitive: `str` buffer size is not checked and it is vulnerable to overflows
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
snprintf(str, sizeof(str), "%s", message); // Prevent overflows by enforcing a maximum size for `str` buffer
----


== Exceptions

It is a very common and acceptable pattern to compute the required size of the buffer with a call to ``++snprintf++`` with the same arguments into an empty buffer (this will fail, but return the necessary size), then to call ``++sprintf++`` as the bound check is not needed anymore. Note that 1 needs to be added by the size reported by ``++snprintf++`` to account for the terminal null character.

----
size_t buflen = snprintf(0, 0, "%s", message);
char* buf = malloc(buflen + 1); // For the final 0
sprintf(buf, "%s", message);{code}

The +1 should be inside the malloc
