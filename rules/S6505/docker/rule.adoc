When installing dependencies, package managers like ``++npm++`` will
automatically execute shell scripts distributed along with the source code.
Post-install scripts, for example, are a common way to execute malicious code
at install time whenever a package is compromised.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The execution of dependency installation scripts is required for the application to function correctly.

There is a risk if you answered no to the question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Execution of third-party scripts should be disabled if not strictly necessary
for dependencies to work correctly.
Doing this will reduce the attack surface and block a well-known supply chain
attack vector.


== Sensitive Code Example

[source,docker]
----
# Sensitive
RUN npm install
----

[source,docker]
----
# Sensitive
RUN yarn install
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,docker]
----
RUN npm install --ignore-scripts
----

[source,docker]
----
RUN yarn install --ignore-scripts

== Implementation Specification

=== Message

* Omitting `--ignore-scripts` can lead to the execution of shell scripts. Make sure it is safe here.

=== Highlighting

Highlight the command and the subcommand, if the latter is present.
