This rule raises an issue when an `import` statement references a module that is not listed as a dependency in the project's `package.json` file.

== Why is this an issue?

Importing modules that are not explicitly declared as dependencies in `package.json` can cause your application to work locally but fail in production environments.

When you import a module that isn't listed in your dependencies, you might be relying on:

* A transitive dependency (a dependency of another dependency)
* A globally installed package
* A package that happens to be available in your local environment

This creates several risks:

* **Production failures**: The module might not be available when your code is deployed
* **Dependency changes**: If the package providing the transitive dependency changes or removes it, your code will break
* **Environment inconsistencies**: Different team members or CI/CD systems might have different packages available
* **Security vulnerabilities**: Undeclared dependencies make it harder to track and audit your project's security posture

Even if a transitive dependency consistently works, it should be explicitly declared in your `package.json` to ensure reliability and make your project's dependencies transparent.

=== What is the potential impact?

Applications may work in development but fail in production when undeclared dependencies are not available. This can lead to runtime errors, deployment failures, and inconsistent behavior across different environments.

=== How to fix?


Add the missing module to your package.json dependencies. Install it using npm or your package manager of choice.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// package.json only has "lodash" as dependency
import express from 'express'; // Noncompliant
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const app = express();
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Add express to package.json dependencies first:
// npm install express

import express from 'express';
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const app = express();
