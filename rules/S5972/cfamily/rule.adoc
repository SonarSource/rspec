== Why is this an issue?

The functions of `std::string` and `std::string_view` that search inside the string return the character position, and use the special value `npos` if the pattern was not found. When converted to a boolean, `npos` is equivalent to `true`. Therefore, testing if the search succeeded requires to compare the returned value to `npos`, not to use it in a boolean context.

This rule raises an issue when the returned value the following functions are used in a boolean context:

* `find`
* `rfind`
* `find_first_of`
* `find_last_of`
* `find_first_not_of`
* `find_last_not_of`


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  std::string s = "";
  if (s.find("42")) { // Noncompliant
    // this branch is taken even if "s" doesn't contain "42"
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  std::string s = "";
  if (s.find("42") != std::string::npos) {
    // this branch is correctly not taken
  }
}
