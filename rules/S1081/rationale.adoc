An attacker typically provides input that exceeds the expected size. This could be through a text field in a user interface, a file that the program reads, or data sent over a network. The insecure function then processes this oversized input, leading to unexpected behavior.

When using typical C or C++ functions, it's up to the developer to make sure the size of the buffer to be written to is large enough to avoid buffer overflows.
