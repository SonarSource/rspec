A coroutine that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.

Such coroutines inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain. 


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller functions which focus on well-defined tasks. It might be difficult to split the parts of a coroutine that contain ``++co_yield++`` of ``++co_await++`` statements, but the other parts can be split into normal functions.


Those smaller functions will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
