The strings that should be detected are any kind of absolute or OS-specific URI - but not relative ones. For instance:

* should be detected:
** Strings starting with an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme[URI scheme]:
*** \http://www.mywebsite.com
*** ftp://myserver.com
*** file:/my/folder
*** ...etc
** //my-network-drive

I've set JS and TS as irrelevant for this rule, as it's common practice to hardcode urls (e.g. for API endpoints). Even if sometimes the rule might be relevant, still ROI is low (rule has low value and implementation is not super trivial)
