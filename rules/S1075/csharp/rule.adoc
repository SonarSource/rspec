Hardcoding a URI makes it difficult to test a program: path literals are not always portable across operating systems, a given absolute path may not exist on a specific test environment, a specified Internet URL may not be available when executing the tests, production environment filesystems usually differ from the development environment, ...etc. For all those reasons, a URI should never be hardcoded. Instead, it should be replaced by customizable parameter.


Further even if the elements of a URI are obtained dynamically, portability can still be limited if the path-delimiters are hardcoded.


This rule raises an issue when URI's or path delimiters are hardcoded.

== Exceptions

This rule does not raise an issue when an ASP.NET virtual path is passed as an argument to one of the following:

* methods: ``++System.Web.HttpServerUtilityBase.MapPath()++``, ``++System.Web.HttpRequestBase.MapPath()++``, ``++System.Web.HttpResponseBase.ApplyAppPathModifier()++``, ``++System.Web.Mvc.UrlHelper.Content()++``
* all methods of: ``++System.Web.VirtualPathUtility++``
* constructors of: ``++Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.VirtualFileResult++``, ``++Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.VirtualPathData++``
