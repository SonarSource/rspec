\[~ann.campbell.2] LGTM, but I'm not 100% happy with the title. ``++[DefaultValue]++`` can be used with ``++[Optional]++``, you might build your own tooling around it, and read the value specified in ``++[DefaultValue]++``. So we should probably not say that you shouldn't use it. But I have no better ideas than the current one.

\[~tamas.vajk] I struggled with this title myself, and I recognize that ``++[DefaultValue]++`` + ``++[Optional]++`` is a valid usage. But the best alternate title gets into intent, which I don't want to do: '[DefaultValue]" should not be used with "[Optional]" when "[DefaultParamterValue]" was intended'


And if you're building tooling around ``++[DefaultValue]++`` then you'll turn this rule off.
