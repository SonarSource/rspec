== Why is this an issue?

``++Throwable++`` is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java. ``++Error++`` is the superclass of all errors, which are not meant to be caught by applications.


Catching either ``++Throwable++`` or ``++Error++`` will also catch ``++OutOfMemoryError++`` and ``++InternalError++``, from which an application should not attempt to recover.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
try { /* ... */ } catch (Throwable t) { /* ... */ }  
try { /* ... */ } catch (Error e) { /* ... */ }   
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
try { /* ... */ } catch (RuntimeException e) { /* ... */ }
try { /* ... */ } catch (MyException e) { /* ... */ }
----
