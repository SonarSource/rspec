``++Throwable++`` is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java. ``++Error++`` is the superclass of all errors, which are not meant to be caught by applications.

Catching either ``++Throwable++`` or ``++Error++`` will also catch ``++OutOfMemoryError++`` and ``++InternalError++``, from which an application should not attempt to recover.
