== Why is this an issue?

``++*++`` and ``++**++``, conventionally known as ``++*args++`` and ``++**kwargs++`` (although any names can be used), can be used in either a function definition or in a function call. In a function definition, they allow a variable number of arguments to be passed. In a function call, they simply obscure the actual values being used in the call.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
my_arg_list = ("yellow", "green", 42)
my_arg_dictionary = {"first" : "Sam", "next": 4, "last": my_obj}
# many lines of code...

function_with_args(*my_arg_list) #Noncompliant
function_with_named_args(**my_arg_dictionary) #Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
function_with_args("yellow", "green", 42)
function_with_named_args(first = "Sam", next = 4, last = my_obj)
----
