Process permissions in privileged containers are essentially the same as root permissions on the host. If these processes are
not protected by robust security measures, an attacker who compromises this container might be able to compromise the host as well.
From this point, they are likely to gain the ability to move even further to other managed nodes.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The services of this container are accessible to people who are not administrators of the managed nodes.

There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.
