Running containers in privileged mode can reduce the resilience of a cluster in
the event of a security incident because it weakens the isolation between hosts
and containers.

Process permissions in privileged containers are essentially the same as root
permissions on the host. If these processes are not protected by robust
security measures, an attacker who compromises a root process on a Pod's host
is likely to gain the ability to pivot within the cluster. +
Depending on how resilient the cluster is, attackers can extend their attack to
the cluster by compromising the nodes from which the cluster launched the
process.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The services of this Pod are accessible to people who are not administrators of the Kubernetes cluster.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Disable privileged mode.
