Process permissions in privileged containers are essentially the same as root
permissions on the host. If these processes are not protected by robust
security measures, an attacker who compromises a root process on a Pod's host
is likely to gain the ability to pivot within the cluster. +
Depending on how resilient the cluster is, attackers can extend their attack to
the cluster by compromising the nodes from which the cluster launched the
process.
