== Why is this an issue?

``++setuid++`` family of functions are used to change the user identity of the caller process in order to change privileges for the following actions. If the function call returns with an error, the rest of the program will execute with unexpected privileges leading to unexpected behaviour.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  ...
  setuid(0); // Noncompliant
  ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  ...
  if (setuid(0)) {
    // fail
  }
  ...
}
----
