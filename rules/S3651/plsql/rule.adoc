== Why is this an issue?

``++WHERE++`` clause conditions that reinforce or contradict the definitions of their columns are useless; they are always either unconditionally true or unconditionally false. For instance, there's no point in including ``++AND column IS NOT NULL++`` if the column is defined as non-null.


*Noteworthy*

This rule raises issues only when a *Data Dictionary* is provided during the analysis. See https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/plsql/

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE product
(id INT,
  name VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
  mfg_name VARCHAR(6),
  mfg_id INT
  ...

SELECT name, price
FROM product
WHERE name is not null -- Noncompliant; always true. This column is NOT NULL
  AND mfg_name = 'Too long name' -- Noncompliant; always false. This column can contain only 6 characters
