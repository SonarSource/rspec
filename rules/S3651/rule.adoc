== Why is this an issue?

``++WHERE++`` clause conditions that reinforce or contradict the definitions of their columns are useless; they are always either unconditionally true or unconditionally false. For instance, there's no point in including ``++AND column IS NOT NULL++`` if the column is defined as non-null.
