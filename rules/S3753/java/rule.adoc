A Spring ``++@Controller++`` that uses ``++@SessionAttributes++`` is designed to handle a stateful / multi-post form. Such ``++@Controller++``s use the specified ``++@SessionAttributes++`` to store data on the server between requests. That data should be cleaned up when the session is over, but unless ``++setComplete()++`` is called on the ``++SessionStatus++`` object from a ``++@RequestMapping++`` method, neither Spring nor the JVM will know it's time to do that. Note that the ``++SessionStatus++`` object must be passed to that method as a parameter.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
@Controller
@SessionAttributes("hello")  // Noncompliant; this doesn't get cleaned up
public class HelloWorld {

  @RequestMapping("/greet", method = GET)
  public String greet(String greetee) {

    return "Hello " + greetee;
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
@Controller
@SessionAttributes("hello")
public class HelloWorld {

  @RequestMapping("/greet", method = GET)
  public String greet(String greetee) {

    return "Hello " + greetee;
  }

  @RequestMapping("/goodbye", method = POST)
  public String goodbye(SessionStatus status) {
    //... 
    status.setComplete();    
  }

}
