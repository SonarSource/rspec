SessionStatus could be a parameter of, not only POST requests, but any kind of @RequestMapping  (like GET requests). Example:

IMO the implementation of this rule should check for each class annotated by @Controller and @SessionAttributes, there's at least one call to "sessionStatus.setComplete()" in any method body of this class. Because if such call exist, there's other rules to ensure that the code is reachable, the method is used, ... So we don't need to focus on @RequestMapping, @PostMapping, GET, POST, ...
