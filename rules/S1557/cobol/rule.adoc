== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++DISTINCT++`` in SQL ``++SELECT++`` statements should be avoided. Not only is this command to remove duplicates not efficient, but a ``++SELECT DISTINCT++`` query indicates that something is not quite right. That is because using the ``++DISTINCT++`` keyword means that redundant data is being pulled from the database and then discarded.
