== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces the member function ``++contains++`` on associative containers to check if an equivalent to a specific key already exists in the container.


Calling this function can replace previous ways to check if a key is present in a container:

* call ``++find()++`` and check that its result is not the end of the container. This was quite verbose.
* call ``++count()++``. This did not clearly express the intent, and was not optimal in terms of performances for containers that allow a key to be present multiple times.

This rule raises an issue when “contains” could be used to simplify the code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f1(std::set<int> &s) {
  if (s.find(1) == s.end()) { // Noncompliant
      doSomething();
  }
}

void f2(std::unordered_map<std::string, int> &m) {
  if (m.count("key") != 0) { // Noncompliant
      doSomething();
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f1(std::set<int> &s) {
  if (!s.contains(1)) { // Compliant
      doSomething();
  }
}

void f2(std::unordered_map<std::string, int> &m) {
  if (m.contains("key")) { // Compliant
      doSomething();
  }
}
----
