== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- Whenever possible, use identifiers that user can easy reset.
- Donâ€™t link identifiers to personally-identifiable information without collecting users' explicit consent.
- Avoid using identifier that are linked to the device hardware (MAC address, IMEI, etc).
- Only use Advertising ID for user profiling or ads use cases.

For ads use cases, use the Advertising ID provided by the platform. This identifier is designed to be reset by the user and has an associated Personalized Ads flag.

For non-ads use cases the most privacy-friendly identifier that can be used are:

- Firebase installation ID (FID)
- A privately stored GUID generated by the app
