== Why is this an issue?

Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently, and consistently indented code has a strong impact on readability. This rule checks that the following spacing conventions are followed:

* 01 level declaration should start in a specific column (8 by default)
* Subordinate data items must be indented from superior data items.
* In a file, all data item declarations having the same level should start in the same column


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
01 StudentDetails.
     05 StudentId        PIC 9(7).    *< Noncompliant: indented too far
   05 StudentName. 
      07 FirstName     PIC X(10).
        07 MiddleInitial PIC X.            *< Noncompliant
      07 Surname       PIC X(15).
   05 DateOfBirth.
      07 DayOfBirth    PIC 99.
      07 MonthOfBirth  PIC 99.
    07 YearOfBirth   PIC 9(4).          *< Noncomopliant
   09 CourseCode       PIC X(4).     *< Noncompliant: not indented enough
