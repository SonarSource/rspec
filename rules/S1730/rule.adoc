Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently, and consistently indented code has a strong impact on readability. This rule checks that the following spacing conventions are followed:

* 01 level declaration should start in a specific column (8 by default)
* Subordinate data items must be indented from superior data items.
* In a file, all data item declarations having the same level should start in the same column
