== Why is this an issue?

The comma between two expressions that are not different function arguments is called "the comma operator" and has special evaluation semantics. The expression composed of the three expressions separated by a comma are evaluated sequentially and the results of all but the last subexpression are discarded. For example in the expression ``++foo(), a = 1, i - 1++``: first ``++foo++`` is invoked, then ``++a++`` is assigned 1, and finally ``++i - 1++`` is computed and becomes the result of the whole expression, ignoring the result of the previous two subexpressions.


The use of a comma operator is rarely justified, see S878. Moreover, {cpp}20 deprecates the use of a comma operator inside "the subscript operator" argument (the square brackets []) because it might be repurposed in the later editions of the standard for multidimensional arrays. In case you still want to call the comma operator inside a subscript operator, you will have to enclose it in parentheses.


This rule reports the use of a comma operator in the argument of a subscript operator.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
a[1, 2] = 3; // Noncompliant

x = a[i++, j = i + 1, j*2]; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
a[(1, 2)] = 3; // Compliant: explicit use of the operator ","
j = i + 1;
x = a[j*2];
++i;
----
