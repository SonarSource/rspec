== Why is this an issue?

``++std::string_view++`` is a read-only view over a string, it doesn't hold any data, it only holds a pointer to the first character of the string and its length. ``++std::string_view++`` can offer better performance than ``++std::string++`` in several cases:


* no memory allocations are required during construction, it is cheap to pass them by value, no need to pass them by reference
* no heap allocation when passing a string literal to a ``++std::string_view++`` function argument
* ``++substr++`` operations over a ``++std::string_view++`` do not require memory allocation

When using ``++std::string_view++`` you shouldn't however forget that:


* it's a non-owning range, you should keep into consideration the liveness of the pointed range
* it doesn't guarantee a null-terminated string like ``++std::string++``

This rule flags ``++const std::string&++`` function arguments, which can be safely replaced with ``++std::string_view++`` ones when not relying on the null-termination character.


Note that, if you are calling ``++substr++`` on the parameter, you may have to modify your code to explicitly cast the result to ``++std::string++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void fun(const std::string& name) { // Noncompliant, replace const std::string& by std::string_view
  // ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void fun(std::string_view name) {
  // ...
}
