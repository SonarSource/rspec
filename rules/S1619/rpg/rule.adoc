== Why is this an issue?

When storing numeric fields, using an odd number of digits allows the sign to be included in the storage area without wasting any space. 

For example the number -1234567, when packed as 7 digits is stored as follows. 

----
1357
246- 
----
thus taking up only 4 data slots. but when packed as 8 characters it uses 5 data slots 

----
02467 
0135- 
----
or when 7 digits, non-packed, it will be stored as 8 data slots, including the sign. 

----
FFFFFFF6 
12345670 
----
