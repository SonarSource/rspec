== Why is this an issue?

Doing an operation on a string without using the result of the operation is useless and is certainly due to a misunderstanding. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
var str = "..."
str.toUpperCase(); // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
var str = "..."
str = str.toUpperCase();
----

${objectName} is an immutable object; you must either store or return the result of the operation.
