== Sensitive Code Example

Python 2 and Python 3

----
import sys
from sys import stdin, __stdin__

# Any reference to sys.stdin or sys.__stdin__ without a method call is Sensitive
sys.stdin  # Sensitive

for line in sys.stdin:  # Sensitive
    print(line)

it = iter(sys.stdin)  # Sensitive
line = next(it)

# Calling the following methods on stdin or __stdin__ is sensitive
sys.stdin.read()  # Sensitive
sys.stdin.readline()  # Sensitive
sys.stdin.readlines()  # Sensitive

# Calling other methods on stdin or __stdin__ does not require a review, thus it is not Sensitive
sys.stdin.seekable()  # Ok
# ...
----

Python 2 only

----
raw_input('What is your password?')  # Sensitive
----

Python 3 only

----
input('What is your password?')  # Sensitive
----

Function ``++fileinput.input++`` and class ``++fileinput.FileInput++`` read the standard input when the list of files is empty.

----
for line in fileinput.input():  # Sensitive
    print(line)

for line in fileinput.FileInput():  # Sensitive
    print(line)

for line in fileinput.input(['setup.py']):  # Ok
    print(line)

for line in fileinput.FileInput(['setup.py']):  # Ok
    print(line)
