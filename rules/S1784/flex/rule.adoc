Access modifiers define which classes can access properties, variables, methods, and other classes. If an access modifier is not specified, the access level defaults to ``++internal++``, which grants access to all classes in the same package. This may be what is intended, but it should be specified explicitly to avoid confusion.


Available access modifiers are:

* ``++internal++`` - access allowed within the same package
* ``++private++`` - access allowed only within the same class
* ``++protected++`` - access allowed to the class and its child classes
* ``++public++`` - unfettered access by all

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function checkResources():Boolean { 
  ...
  return true;
}

== Compliant Solution

----
public function checkResources():Boolean { 
  ...
  return true;
}
