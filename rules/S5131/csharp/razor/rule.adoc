=== How does this work?

Template engines are used by web applications to build HTML content. Template files contain static HTML as well as template language instruction. These instructions allow, for example, to insert dynamic values (variables) in the document as the template is rendered. Template engines can auto escape HTML special characters of variables in order to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

In .NET applications relying on Razor, the auto-escaping feature is enabled by default. XSS vulnerabilities arise when an untrusted value is injected in the template and that auto-escaping is disabled using ``++{% autoescape false %}++`` or ``++|safe++`` filter. This is often the case when a piece of dynamic HTML is generated from the Python code and used in a template variable.

==== In C# code

To prevent cross-site scripting directly from code, two concepts are worth mentioning:

First, that the compiler considers `IHtmlContent` to be a developer-defined HTML content. This means that:

* Razor does not HTML-encode it at runtime to avoid double-encoding.
* Any data that is not programmatically HTML encoded before being sent to Razor is unsafe.

Second, the HTML and JavaScript encoders are available to the C# code in two ways:

* Via dependency injection
* Via the `System.Text.Encodings.Web` namespace

The return type of the encoders is a string.

[source,csharp]
----
public class ViewModel 
{
    public string ThirdPartyString     { get; private set; }
    public IHtmlContent ThirdPartyHtml { get; private set; }

    public ViewModel(string thirdPartyData)
    {
        this.ThirdPartyString = thirdPartyData;
        this.ThirdPartyHtml   = new HtmlString(thirdPartyData); // NonCompliant
    }
}
----

[source,csharp]
----
public class ViewModel 
{
    public string       CleanThirdPartyString { get; private set; }
    public IHtmlContent CleanThirdPartyHtml   { get; private set; }

    public ViewModel(string thirdPartyData, HtmlEncoder htmlEncoder)
    {
        thirdPartyData             = htmlEncoder.Encode(thirdPartyData);
        this.CleanThirdPartyString = thirdPartyData;
        this.CleanThirdPartyHtml   = new HtmlString(thirdPartyData);
    }
}

==== HTML Encoding in the Razor View

To prevent cross-site scripting from a Razor view, it is especially important to identify what types of input are being sent from the underlying C# code:

* `IHtmlContent` is considered by the runtime environment to be a developer-defined HTML content. This means that:
** Razor does not HTML-encode it at runtime to avoid double-encoding.
** Any data that is not programmatically HTML encoded before being sent to Razor is unsafe.
* `string` variables are automatically encoded by Razor if they are included with the default `@variable` notation.


Two Razor functions are to be avoided:

* `@Html.Raw(any)`: This function returns `IHTMLString`, which is not encoded because it is an `IHtmlContent`.
* `@{ Output.Write(Model.ThirdPartyString); }`: This function uses `Razor` 's internal raw `TextWriter`, which does not perform any transformations, such as encoding.

Finally, if `IHtmlContent` actually needs to be used by the Razor view, the `@Html.Encode()` function will make the content harmless. 

*Note*: This section applies to all data passed to a Razor view, including global objects such as:

* `ViewData`
* `ViewBag`
* `TempData`
* `Context` (`HttpContext`)


[source,html]

@*
    // Code sent to the Razor View

    string       CleanThirdPartyString = HTMLEncoder.Encode(ThirdPartyString);

@Html.Raw(Model.CleanThirdPartyString)   

@{ Output.Write(Model.CleanThirdPartyString); }

@ViewData["ThirdPartyString"] 
@Html.Raw(ViewBag.CleanThirdPartyString)

@{
    object thirdPartyObject = ViewBag.ThirdPartyString; // Value is read from ViewBagAll argument => can cause FP
    string thirdPartyString = ViewBag.ThirdPartyString as string;
}
@thirdPartyString

==== JavaScript Encoding In The Razor View

Using the `@Html.Raw` function to embed third party input in Javascript is
discouraged, even though StackOverflow contributions suggest it. It could be
used so that automatic HTML encoding does not mess up the logic of the code,
but actually makes the code vulnerable to injection vulnerabilities.

To quickly and safely use a variable from C# code in JS logic, put the value in
a data attribute of an HTML tag. Other options include injecting services into
views or using encoders directly in Razor code, but these methods require more
code.

When you insert a value into an HTML tag attribute, Razor automatically encodes
the value and protects the code from any web-based injection.

After that, this data is accessible to normal native JavaScript functions. The
JavaScript functions `GetElementById` and `GetAttribute` retrieve the data
without having to decode it in the meantime.

If third-party data retrieved using JS needs to be inserted into the HTML code, use:

* `element.innerText`
* `element.textContent`
* `document.createTextNode`

Because these functions interpret data as `text` and not as `code`.

Do not use the following methods and attributes. Because they interpret data as
`code` and not as `text`, they are therefore vulnerable to security
vulnerabilities:

* `document.write()`
* `document.writeln()`
* `document.domain`
* `element.innerHTML`
* `element.outerHTML`
* `element.insertAdjacentHTML`
* `element.onevent`

Note: Including third party data in special Razor form tags is considered safe for some of them:

* The `asp-route-{value}` attribute is automatically encoded by the runtime with the `BeginWriteTagHelperAttribute()` function.
* HTML attributes are automatically encoded by the runtime with the `AddHtmlAttributeValue()` function.

[source,html]
----
<script>
    var thirdPartyData = "@Html.Raw(thirdPartyData)"; // Noncompliant
</script>
----

[source,html]
----
<div id="thirdPartyData"
     data-thirdPartyData="@thirdPartyData" />

<div id="cleanThirdPartyData" />

<script>
    var thirdPartyData = document.getElementById("thirdPartyData");
    var cleanThirdPartyData = thirdPartyData.getAttribute("data-thirdPartyData");

    // Alternative
    var cleanJsEncodedData = "@System.Text.Encodings.Web.JavaScriptEncoder.Default.Encode(untrustedInput)";

    // If this data needs to be added back into HTML
    document.getElementById("cleanThirdPartyData").innerText += cleanThirdPartyData;
</script>

Implementing content security policies differs from one architecture to another.

* When client-side code is processed by Blazor
** {blazor-csps}[the library supports it by default].
* When CSP requirements are low
** {aspdotnet-core-middleware}[the ASP.Net Core Middleware provides header control].
* When code requirements enforce optimal CSP, including content security policies nonces
** The Open Web Interface for . NET (OWIN) {csp-nonces-owin}[can be used for a simple implementation].
