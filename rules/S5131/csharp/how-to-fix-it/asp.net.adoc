=== How to fix it in ASP.NET

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;

public class HelloController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    public void Hello(string name, HttpResponse response)
    {
        string html = "<h1>Hello " + name + "</h1>"
        response.Write(html);
    }
}

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;

public class HelloController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    public void Hello(string name, HttpResponse response)
    {
        string html = "<h1>Hello " + HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(name) + "</h1>"
        response.Write(html);
    }
}

=== How does this work?

If the HTTP response is HTML code, it is highly recommended to use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/getting-started/introducing-razor-syntax-c[Razor-based view templates] to generate it.
This template engine separates the view from the business logic and automatically encodes the output of variables, drastically reducing the risk of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

`System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` is the recommended method to encode HTML entities.
