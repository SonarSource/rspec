=== How does this work?

In case the response consists of HTML code, it is highly recommended to use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/getting-started/introducing-razor-syntax-c[Razor-based view templates] to generate it. A proper template engine does not only separate the view from the business logic and thus results in a more maintainable application. It also automatically encodes variable output and thus drastically decreases the chance of introducing Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.


include::../../common/fix/data_encoding.adoc[]

`System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` is the recommended method to encode HTML entities.
