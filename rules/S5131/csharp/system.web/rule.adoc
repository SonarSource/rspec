=== HTML Encoding in .Net Framework 4.8

Several options are available to prevent cross-site scripting injections with
the "System.Web" dll:

* `System.Web.HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode`
* `System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode`
* `System.Web.Security.AntiXss.AntiXssEncoder` class methods

You can use the AntiXssEncoder class to override the HttpEncoder class, which
is used by default to encode and decode strings in methods of classes such as
HttpUtility, HttpServerUtility, and HttpResponseHeader.

The difference between the two is negligible because AntiXssEncoder allows you
to switch between named HTML 4.0 entities and numeric entities. For example,
the character `>` ("greater than") would be either `&#62;` or `&gt;`.

public class Constructor : Controller
{
    protected static string doGet(string thirdPartyString, HttpResponse response)
    {
        response.Write(thirdPartyString); // Noncompliant
    }

public class Constructor : Controller

    {
        string cleanThirdPartyString    = HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(thirdPartyString);

        // Alternative
        string altCleanThirdPartyString = AntiXssEncoder.HtmlEncode(thirdPartyString, true);

        response.Write(cleanThirdPartyString);
    }
