==== Deny Lists

The creation of deny lists is a typical mechanism to stop a particular attack
without fixing the underlying problem. Such filters, considered a gimmick by
hackers, are found either in code or in web application firewalls.

Unfortunately, creating a deny list is a common trap that should be avoided at
all costs, as malicious users can easily change their exploit payloads and get
back into the application.
