==== Deny Lists

The creation of deny lists is a typical mechanism to stop a particular attack
without fixing the underlying problem. Such filters, considered a gimmick by
hackers, are found either in code or in web application firewalls.

Unfortunately, creating a deny list is a common trap that should be avoided at
all costs, as malicious users can easily change their exploit payloads and get
back into the application.

===== Error-prone use case

If the application must allow users or third-party services to send HTML
layouts to be used by the application, several basic HTML tags should be
allowed.

If the list of allowed HTML tags is not maintainable in the long run, the
preferred option is to use Markdown in conjunction with a parser that removes
embedded HTML and restricts the use of "javascript:" URI. By completely
isolating the generation of HTML, the code is more secure and the security of
the application remains simple.
