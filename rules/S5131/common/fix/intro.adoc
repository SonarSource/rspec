The root of this problem lies in the application of the AppSec principle which
states that third-party services should not be trusted.

As a programmer of web services, this principle is quite easy to apply: If the 
code programmatically receives data from a third-party service, validate and/or
sanitize the data to make it safe.

As an end-user, the only way to prevent unwanted code from running in a browser is to
disable Javascript altogether. 

Neither the end-user nor the web application wants to degrade their Internet
experience by disabling Javascript. +
As an organization, we need end-users to use our services, and trust that our
services will protect them from running unwanted code in their own browsers.

That's why we need to proactively protect users from `XSS`.
