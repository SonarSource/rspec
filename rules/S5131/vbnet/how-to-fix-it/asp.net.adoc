== How to fix it in ASP.NET

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Imports System.Web
Imports System.Web.Mvc

Public Class HelloController
    Inherits Controller

    <HttpGet>
    Public Sub Hello(name As String, response As HttpResponse)
        Dim html As String = "<h1>Hello" & name & "</h1>"
        response.Write(html)
    End Sub
End Class
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Imports System.Web
Imports System.Web.Mvc

Public Class HelloController
    Inherits Controller

    <HttpGet>
    Public Sub Hello(name As String, response As HttpResponse)
        Dim html As String = "<h1>Hello" & HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(name) & "</h1>"
        response.Write(html)
    End Sub
End Class

=== How does this work?

If the HTTP response is HTML code, it is highly recommended to use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/getting-started/introducing-razor-syntax-c[Razor-based view templates] to generate it.
This template engine separates the view from the business logic and automatically encodes the output of variables, drastically reducing the risk of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

`System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` is the recommended method to encode HTML entities.
