== How to fix it?

User input embedded in HTML code should be HTML-encoded to prevent the injection of additional code.
PHP provides the built-in function `htmlspecialchars` to do this.

[source,php]
----
echo '<h1>' . $input . '</h1>'; // Noncompliant
----

[source,php]
----
echo '<h1>' . htmlspecialchars($input) . '</h1>';
----

If you do not intend to send HTML code to the clients, the vulnerability can be resolved by telling them what data they are receiving using the content-type header.
For example, setting the content-type to `text/plain` using the built-in `header` function allows to safely reflect user input since browsers will not try to parse and execute the response.

[source,php]
----
echo $input; // Noncompliant
----

[source,php]
----
header('Content-Type: text/plain');
echo $input;
----

=== How does this work?

=== Pitfalls

include::../../common/pitfalls/content-types.adoc[]

==== PHP-specific pitfalls

The content-type header has to be sent before any output is generated.
Otherwise, the header will not be sent to the client at all.

By default, `htmlspecialchars` does not encode single quotes. Make sure to set the option `ENT_QUOTES` to encode single quotes if required by the context.

[source,php]
----
echo "<img src='" . htmlspecialchars($input, ENT_QUOTES) . "'>";
----
