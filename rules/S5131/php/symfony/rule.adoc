== How to fix it?

In case the response consists of HTML code, it is highly recommended to use a template engine like https://twig.symfony.com/[Twig] to generate it.
A proper template engine does not only separate the view from the business logic and thus results in a more maintainable application.
It also automatically encodes variable output and thus drastically decreases the chance of introducing Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

If you do not intend to send HTML code to the clients, the vulnerability can be resolved by telling them what data they are receiving.
For example, you can use the class `JsonResponse` to safely return JSON messages.
The class automatically sets the content-type to `application/json`.
This tells the browser that the response does not contain HTML code and should not be parsed and interpreted as HTML.
Thus, the response is not vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting.

[source,php]
----
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;

$response = new JsonResponse(['data' => $input]);
----

It is also possible to set the content-type manually using the `headers` attribute.
For example, setting the content-type to `text/plain` allows to safely reflect user input since browsers will not try to parse and execute the response.

[source,php]
----
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

$response = new Response();
$response->headers->set('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
$response->setContent($input);
----

== How does this work?

=== Pitfalls

Be aware that there are more content-types than `text/html` that allow to execute JavaScript code in a browser and thus are prone to Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
The following content-types are known to be affected:

 * application/mathml+xml
 * application/rdf+xml
 * application/vnd.wap.xhtml+xml
 * application/xhtml+xml
 * application/xml
 * image/svg+xml
 * text/html
 * text/rdf
 * text/xml
 * text/xsl
