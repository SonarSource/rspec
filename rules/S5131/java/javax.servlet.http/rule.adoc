== How to fix it?

The following code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting because it returns an HTML response that contains user input.

User input embedded in HTML code should be HTML-encoded to prevent the injection of additional code. This can be done with the https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/[OWASP Java Encoder] or similar libraries.

    String data        = request.getParameter("input");
    PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();

    writer.print(data); // Noncompliant

import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;

public void endpoint(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException
{
    String data        = request.getParameter("input");
    PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();

    writer.print(Encode.forHtml(data));
}

If you do not intend to send HTML code to the clients, the vulnerability can be resolved by telling them what data they are receiving using the content-type header.

For example, setting the content-type to `text/plain` using the `setContentType` function allows to safely reflect user input since browsers will not try to parse and execute the response.

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/data_encoding.adoc[]

`org.owasp.encoder.Encode.forHtml` is the recommended method to encode HTML entities.
