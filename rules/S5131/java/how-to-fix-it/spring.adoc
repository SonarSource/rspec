== How to fix it in Spring

=== Code examples

The following code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting because it returns an HTML response that contains user input.

If you do not intend to send HTML code to clients, the vulnerability can be fixed by specifying the type of data returned in the response.
For example, you can use the `produces` property of the `GetMapping` annotation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=21,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@RestController
public class ApiController
{
    @GetMapping(value = "/endpoint")
    public String endpoint(@RequestParam("input") input)
    {
        return input;
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=21,diff-type=compliant]
----
@RestController
public class ApiController
{
    @GetMapping(value = "/endpoint", produces = "text/plain")
    public String endpoint(@RequestParam("input") input)
    {
        return input;
    }
}
----

=== How does this work?

If the HTTP response is HTML code, it is highly recommended to use a template engine like https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] to generate it.
This template engine separates the view from the business logic and automatically encodes the output of variables, drastically reducing the risk of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

If you do not intend to send HTML code to clients, the vulnerability can be fixed by specifying the type of data returned in the response with the `content-type` HTTP header.
This header tells the browser that the response does not contain HTML code and should not be parsed and interpreted as HTML.
Thus, the response is not vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting.

For example, setting the content-type to `text/plain` allows to safely reflect user input since browsers will not try to parse and execute the response.
