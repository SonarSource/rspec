== How to fix it?

The following code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting because it returns an HTML response that contains user input.

Third-party data, such as user input, is not to be trusted.
If embedded in HTML code, it should be HTML-encoded to prevent the injection of additional code. This can be done with the https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/[OWASP Java Encoder] or similar libraries.

[source,java]
----
public void endpoint(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException
{
    String data        = request.getParameter("input");
    PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();

    writer.print(data); // Noncompliant
}

| ==== Compliant Solution

[source,java]
----
import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;

public void endpoint(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException
{
    String data        = request.getParameter("input");
    PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();

    writer.print(Encode.forHtml(data));
}

|===

If you do not intend to send HTML code to clients, the vulnerability can be fixed by specifying the type of data returned in the response with the content-type header.

For example, setting the content-type to `text/plain` with the `setContentType` function allows to safely reflect user input because browsers will not try to parse and execute the response.

=== How does this work?

include::../common/fix/data_encoding.adoc[]

`org.owasp.encoder.Encode.forHtml` is the recommended method to encode HTML entities.
