=== What is the potential impact?

A well-intentioned user opens a malicious link that injects data into the web application. This data can be text, but it can also be arbitrary code that can be interpreted by the target user's browser, such as HTML, CSS, or Javascript.

In many cases, Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities can be used as a first step in exploiting more dangerous vulnerabilities or features that require higher privileges, such as a code injection vulnerability in the admin control panel of a web application.
