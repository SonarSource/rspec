=== What is the potential impact?

A well-intentioned user opens a malicious link that injects data into the web
application. This data can be text, but it can also be arbitrary code that can
be interpreted by the target user's browser, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

====  Vandalism on the front-end website

The malicious link defaces the target web application from the perspective of
the user who is the victim. This may result in loss of integrity and theft of
the benevolent user's data.

==== Identity spoofing

The forged link injects malicious code into the web application.
The code enables identity spoofing thanks to cookie theft.

==== Record user activity

The forged link injects malicious code into the web application. To leak
confidential information, attackers can inject code that records keyboard
activity (keylogger) and even requests access to other devices, such as the
camera or microphone.

==== Chaining XSS with other vulnerabilities

In many cases, bug hunters and attackers chain cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities with other vulnerabilities to maximize their impact. +
For example, an XSS can be used as the first step to exploit more dangerous
vulnerabilities or features that require higher privileges, such as a code
injection vulnerability in the admin control panel of a web application.
