==== Windows authentication (integrated security)

When the connection string includes the `Integrated Security=true` parameter, it enables Windows authentication (sometimes called integrated security) for the database connection. With integrated security, the user's Windows credentials are used to authenticate and authorize access to the database. It eliminates the need for a separate username and password for the database connection. Integrated security simplifies authentication and leverages the existing Windows authentication infrastructure for secure database access in your C# application.

It's important to note that when using integrated security, the user running the application must have the necessary permissions to access the database. Ensure that the user account running the application has the appropriate privileges and is granted access to the database.
