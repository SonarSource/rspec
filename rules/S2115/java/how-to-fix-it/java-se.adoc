== How to fix it in Django

=== Code examples

The following code uses an empty password to connect to a Postgres database. 

The vulnerability can be fixed by using a strong password retrieved from Properties. This `database.password` property is set during deployment. Its value should be strong and different for each database.

[source,java,diff-id=201,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:memory:myDB;create=true", "login", ""); // Non compliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=201,diff-type=compliant]
----
String password = System.getProperty("database.password");
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:memory:myDB;create=true", "login", password);
