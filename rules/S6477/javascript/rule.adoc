== Why is this an issue?

React expects a unique identifier `key` in list components to optimize rendering. Avoid `Array` indexes since the order of the items may change. When keys are missing, React will default to using indexes. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with the component state.

[source,javascript]
----
function Blog(props) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li>
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
----

Instead, use a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array. The key must be unique among its siblings, not globally. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.

If the data comes from a database, database IDs are already unique and are the best option. Otherwise, use a counter or a UUID generator.

[source,javascript]
----
function Blog(props) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={post.id}>
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
