== Why is this an issue?

`settings.gradle.kts` or `settings.gradle` are used to define general project properties; see the following sample file:

[source,kotlin]
----
rootProject.name = "myProject"

include("foo", "bar")
----

In general it is not mandatory to define the `settings.gradle.kts` or `settings.gradle`, however it is hingly recommended because:

* it improves performance, since Gradle won't navigate up the filesystem directory tree looking for the settings file
* it is a good practice to define project properties, like the `rootProject.name`

== How to fix it

Simply add a `settings.gradle.kts` or `settings.gradle` file. For example with such content:

[source,kotlin]
----
rootProject.name = "myProject"

include("module1", "module2")
----
