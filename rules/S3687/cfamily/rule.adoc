== Why is this an issue?

The main intended use-case for ``++volatile++`` in C and {cpp} is to access data that can be modified by something external to the program, typically some hardware register. In contrast with other languages that provide a ``++volatile++`` keyword, it does not provide any useful guarantees related to atomicity, memory ordering, or inter-thread synchronization. It is only really needed for the kind of low-level code found in kernels or embedded software, i.e. using memory-mapped I/O registers to manipulate hardware directly. 


According to the C standard:

____
``++volatile++`` is a hint to the implementation to avoid aggressive optimization involving the object because the value of the object might be changed by means undetectable by an implementation.

____

Only C11/{cpp}11 "atomic types" are free from data races, and you should use them or synchronization primitives if you want to avoid race conditions.


This rule raises an issue when a local variable or class data member is declared as ``++volatile++`` (at the top level of the type, pointers to volatile are not reported).


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
volatile int counter; // Noncompliant
User * volatile vpUser; // Noncompliant; pointer is volatile 
User volatile * pvUser;  // Compliant; User instance is volatile, not the pointer
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
atomic_int counter;
std::atomic<User*> vpUser;
User volatile * pvUser;
----
