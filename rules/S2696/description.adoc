Correctly updating a `+static+` field from a non-static method is tricky to get right and could easily lead to bugs if there are multiple class instances  and/or multiple threads in play. Ideally, `+static+` fields are only updated from `+synchronized static+` methods.

This rule raises an issue each time a `+static+` field is updated from a non-static method.
