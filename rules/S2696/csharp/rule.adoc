This rule raises an issue each time a `static` field is updated from a non-static method or property.

== Why is this an issue?

Updating a `static` field from a non-`static` method introduces significant challenges and potential bugs. Multiple class instances and threads can access and modify the `static` field concurrently, leading to unintended consequences for other instances or threads (unexpected behavior, https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/1d42da/race-conditions-in-threading-C-Sharp/[race conditions] and synchronization problems).

[source,csharp]
----
class MyClass 
{
  private static int count = 0;

  public void DoSomething() 
  {
    //...
    count++;  // Noncompliant: make the enclosing instance property 'static' or remove this set on the 'static' field.
  }
}

interface MyInterface
{
  private static int count = 0;

  public void DoSomething() 
  {
    //...
    count++;  // Noncompliant: remove this set, which updates a 'static' field from an instance method.
  }
}

\[~ann.campbell.2] I've created this subtask, because in C# this rule can also apply for properties. Furthermore, the `synchronized static` part doesn't work for C#.
