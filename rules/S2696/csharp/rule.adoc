This rule raises an issue each time a `static` field is updated from a non-static method or property.

== Why is this an issue?

Updating a `static` field from a non-`static` method introduces ignificant challenges and potential bugs. Multiple class instances and threads can access and modify the `static` field concurrently, leading to unintended consequences for other instances or threads (unexpected behavior, race conditions and synchronization problems).

[source,csharp,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyClass 
{
  private static int count = 0;

  public void DoSomething() 
  {
    //...
    count++;  // Noncompliant
  }
}

\[~ann.campbell.2] I've created this subtask, because in C# this rule can also apply for properties. Furthermore, the `synchronized static` part doesn't work for C#.
