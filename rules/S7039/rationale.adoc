The Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard that serves as
an additional layer of protection against various types of attacks, including
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It provides a set of standard
procedures for loading resources by user agents, which can help to mitigate the
risk of content injection vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that CSP is not a primary line of defense, but
rather a safety net that catches attempts to exploit vulnerabilities that exist
in the system despite other protective measures. An insecure CSP does not
automatically imply that the website is vulnerable, but it does mean that this
additional layer of protection is weakened.

A CSP can be considered insecure if it allows potentially harmful practices,
such as inline scripts or loading resources from arbitrary domains. These
practices can increase the risk of content injection attacks.
