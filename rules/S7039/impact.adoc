=== What is the potential impact?

An insecure Content Security Policy (CSP) can increase the potential severity of
other vulnerabilities in the system. For instance, if an attacker manages to
exploit a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, an insecure CSP might not
provide the intended additional protection.

The impact of a successful XSS attack can be severe. XSS allows an attacker to
inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can
then be used to steal sensitive information like session cookies, personal data,
or credit card details, leading to identity theft or financial fraud.

Moreover, XSS can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user without their
consent, such as changing their email address or password, or making
transactions. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential loss of control
over user accounts.

In addition, an insecure CSP that allows loading resources from arbitrary
domains could potentially expose sensitive user data to untrusted sources. This
could lead to data breaches, which can have serious legal and reputational
consequences.
