To fix an insecure Content Security Policy (CSP), you should adhere to the
principle of least privilege. This principle states that a user should be given
the minimum levels of access necessary to complete their tasks. In the context
of CSP, this means restricting the sources from which content can be loaded to
the minimum necessary.

Here are some steps to secure your CSP:

* Avoid 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval': These settings allow inline scripts
and script evaluation, which can open the door for executing malicious scripts.
Instead, use script hashes, nonces, or strict dynamic scripting if scripts must
be used.
* Specify exact sources: Rather than using a wildcard (*) which allows any domain,
specify the exact domains from which resources can be loaded. This reduces the
risk of loading resources from potentially malicious sources.
* Use 'self' cautiously: While 'self' is safer than a wildcard, it can still lead
to vulnerabilities if your own site has been compromised or hosts user-uploaded
content. Be sure to validate and sanitize all user content.
