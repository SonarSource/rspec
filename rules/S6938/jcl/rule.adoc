== Why is this an issue?

JCL imposes a limit of a maximum of 255 steps in a single job, including steps executed within procedures called by EXEC statements. Going above this limit will result in a JCL error. In addition, a job that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and maintain.
