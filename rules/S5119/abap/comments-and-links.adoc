Also, is the second line in the code sample intended to be the Compliant solution, or just an example of something that's ignored by the rule? If the former, it should be moved into a separate, "Compliant Solution" sample, where no "compliant" comment is needed because everything in it is compliant by definition. (And really, even in the Noncompliant example I wouldn't use a "compliant" comment.)

\[~ann.campbell.2] Thanks for the review. The second example is just something ignored by the rule. I changed the "Compliant" comment into something more explicit. Let me know if it is still not clear.

* I renamed "OpenSQL" and "OpenSql" into "Open SQL" because it looks to be the format used by SAP: \https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw70/7.0.31/en-US/fc/eb3969358411d1829f0000e829fbfe/content.htm?no_cache=true
* Could you add a link here, as a comment, to SAP Badis, because I can't find what it is and I would like to learn more about it? Thx
