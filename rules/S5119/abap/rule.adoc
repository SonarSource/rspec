== Why is this an issue?

Modifying SAP standard tables via an Open SQL statement can result in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This is because a direct modification bypasses all validation mechanisms.

Instead, the use of standard functions or SAP Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) is recommended.


This rule raises an issue on Open SQL statements ``++INSERT++``, ``++UPDATE++``, ``++MODIFY++``, or ``++SELECT ... FOR UPDATE++`` which target an SAP table, i.e. a table with a name starting with a character between "A" and "X", case insensitive.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
SELECT my_col FROM my_system_table WHERE my_id = 123 FOR UPDATE. " Noncompliant

SELECT my_col FROM z_custom_table WHERE my_id = 123 FOR UPDATE. " Ignored; modifies a custom table
