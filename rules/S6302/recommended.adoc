== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to apply the least privilege principle, i.e. by only granting the necessary permissions to identities. A good practice is to start with the very minimum set of permissions and to refine the policy over time. In order to fix overly permissive policies already deployed in production, a strategy could be to review the monitored activity in order to reduce the set of permissions to those most used.
