== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to implement the least privilege principle, ie to grant the necessary permissions only to identities for their required tasks and on specific resources. A good practice is to start to the very minimum set of permissions and to refine the policy over time. For policies already in production, to fix overly permissive policies, a strategy could be based on the monitored activity in order to reduce the set of permissions to those most used.
