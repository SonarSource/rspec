== Sensitive Code Example

A customer-managed policy that grants all permissions by using the wildcard (*) in the ``++Action++`` property:

[source,python]
----
from aws_cdk.aws_iam import PolicyStatement, Effect

PolicyStatement(
    effect=Effect.ALLOW,
    actions=["*"], # Noncompliant
    resources=["arn:aws:iam:::user/*"]
)
----

== Compliant Solution

A customer-managed policy that grants only the required permissions:

[source,python]
----
from aws_cdk.aws_iam import PolicyStatement, Effect

PolicyStatement(
    effect=Effect.ALLOW,
    actions=["iam:GetAccountSummary"],
    resources=["arn:aws:iam:::user/*"]
)
