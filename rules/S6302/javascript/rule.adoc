== Sensitive Code Example

A customer-managed policy that grants all permissions by using the wildcard (*) in the ``++Action++`` property:

[source,javascript]
----
import { aws_iam as iam } from 'aws-cdk-lib'

new iam.PolicyStatement({
    effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
    actions: ["*"], // Sensitive
    resources: ["arn:aws:iam:::user/*"],
})
----

== Compliant Solution

A customer-managed policy that grants only the required permissions:

[source,javascript]
----
import { aws_iam as iam } from 'aws-cdk-lib'

new iam.PolicyStatement({
    effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
    actions: ["iam:GetAccountSummary"],
    resources: ["arn:aws:iam:::user/*"],
})
----
