A policy that grants all permissions may indicate an improper access control, which violates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[the principle of least privilege]. Suppose an identity needs to read some resources for his intended function but doesn't need to write to them, then only read permission should be granted to this identity, otherwise the (un)intentional overwrite of resources may occur and therefore result in loss of information.
