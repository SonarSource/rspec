== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++free(...)++`` or ``++delete++`` releases the reservation on a memory location, making it immediately available for another purpose. So releasing the same memory location twice can lead to corrupting the program's memory. 


A best practice to avoid this bug calls for setting just-freed pointers to ``++NULL++``, and always null-testing before a ``++free++`` or ``++delete++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char *cp = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    free(cp);
  }

  free(cp);  // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char *cp = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    free(cp);
    cp = NULL; // This will prewent freeing the same memory again
  }

  free(cp); // This is OK: if the memory was freed in the if-block above, free(NULL) is a no-op
  cp = NULL; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
}

Remove this redundant "free" call.

\[~freddy.mallet], what you've edited the description to say was my initial understanding of this problem, but every reference I could find said that a double free would https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html[corrupt the program's memory management data structures]. None of them said that it "only" made the memory available for reallocation.

\[~ann.campbell.2] the program's memory management data structures becomes corrupted because just after the first call to the free() statement this part of the heap memory can immediately be reused/reorganised for any other purpose. So by releasing twice the same memory location, you end up with a memory location used concurrently for two fully different purposes -> crash.

Eventually this rule should cover both double ``++free++`` _and_ double ``++delete++`` but the initial implementation will just be for C.

Euh for me [~ann.campbell.2], there is no doubt about the fact that this is a blocker BUG and not a blocker Code Smell.

You're right, of course [~freddy.mallet]. I struggle a little with the UI.
