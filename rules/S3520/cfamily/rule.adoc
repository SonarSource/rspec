Deallocating a memory location more than once leads to undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

Using `delete` or `free` releases the reservation on a memory location, making it immediately available for another purpose.
Releasing the exact memory location twice leads to undefined behavior and can often crash the program.

The C standard defines as _undefined behavior_ a call to `free` with a pointer to a memory area that has already been released.

The {cpp} standard defines the first `delete` call as the end of the lifetime for dynamically allocated memory.
Access to memory past its lifetime end, including another `delete`, is undefined behavior.

=== What is the potential impact

The danger of a "double-free" comes directly from the fact that it is undefined behavior (in both C and {cpp}).
Note that there is no guarantee that a crash will happen on a "double-free" when the resource is released or at all until the end of the program's execution.

The effects of a "double-free" depend entirely on the program's memory management implementation.
In the case of such an event, one of the following can be observed:

- The program's memory-management data structures can become corrupted.
This will usually cause a crash.
- Demonstrative Example 2 on https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415[CWE-415] presents a set of circumstances where a crash does not occur.
In these circumstances, the corruption of the mentioned data structures causes two later calls to `malloc` to return the same pointer.
This can lead to a sensitive-data-exposure vulnerability or a buffer-overflow vulnerability.

== How to fix it

To ensure that every release happens once, you can follow these best practices:

- Release any allocated memory in the function it was acquired in.
The release should be independent of any additional conditions.
- After a `delete` or `free`, set the pointer's value to `nullptr` or `NULL`.
`delete` of `nullptr` and `free` of `NULL` are defined as having no effect.

=== Code examples

Example for C:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char* cp = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    // ...
    free(cp);
  }

  free(cp);  // Noncompliant: potential call to free in the above branch
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Remove the unnecessary call to `free`:
[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char* cp = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    // ...
  }

  free(cp); // Compliant: no previous call to free in the above branch
}
----

Set the pointer to `NULL` after any call to `free`:
[source,c]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char* cp = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    // ...
    free(cp);
    cp = NULL; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
  }

  free(cp); // Compliant: if the memory was freed in the if-block above, free(NULL) is a no-op
}
----

Example for {cpp}:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  std::string* p = new std::string;

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    // ...
    delete p;
  }

  delete p;  // Noncompliant: potential invocation of delete in the above branch
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Remove the unnecessary invocation of `delete`:
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  std::string* p = new std::string;

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    // ...
  }

  delete p; // Compliant: no previous call to free in the above branch
}
----

Set the pointer to `nullptr` after invoking `delete`:
[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  std::string* p = new std::string;

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    // ...
    delete p;
    p = nullptr; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
  }

  delete p; // Compliant: if the memory was freed in the if-block above, operator delete of nullptr is a no-op
}
----

=== Going the extra mile


include::../../../shared_content/cfamily/memory_raii_extra_mile.adoc[]

Using _RAII_ objects instead of manual memory management can mitigate most dynamic memory management issues, including "double-free".

[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  auto p = std::make_unique<std::string>();

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    p.reset(); // Delete happens here.
  }

  // delete not called by std::unique_ptr destructor if the branch above was taken.
}
----

=== Pitfalls

However, keeping a raw pointer or a reference to memory held by _RAII_ objects may still lead to a "double-free".
Care must be taken to avoid the following pitfalls:

==== Initialization of `std::shared_ptr`

`std::shared_ptr` relies on an internal counter of owners inside a "control block".
This control block is either created when the object is constructed with a raw pointer or inherited when constructed from another `std::shared_ptr`.

Misunderstanding this can lead to a "double-free", as the following example demonstrates.

Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething(char const* data) {
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> p1(new std::string(data));
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> p2(p1.get()); // Noncompliant: Intended: std::shared_ptr<string> p2(p1);
}
----

Both objects are created from the raw pointer, leading them to have independent control blocks. Both will attempt to release the original memory area.

To avoid this, only use copy/move construction for sharing ownership or the `std::make_shared` for initialization.

Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething(char const* data) {
  auto p1 = std::make_shared<std::string>(data);
  auto p2 = p1; // Compliant
}
----

==== Initialization of `std::unique_ptr`

Similar to `std::shared_ptr`, a "double-free" can occur from an erroneous initialization.
This also comes from confusion raised by the constructor overloads of this class.

Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething(char const* data) {
  // Creating another unique_ptr
  std::unique_ptr<std::string> p1(new std::string(data));
  // ...
  std::unique_ptr<std::string> p2(p1.get()); // Noncompliant: both p1 and p2 own the pointer now.

  // Transfering ownership
  std::unqiue_ptr<std::string> p3(new std::string(data));
  // ...
  std::unique_ptr<std::string> p4(p3.get()); // Noncompliant: both p3 and p4 own the pointer now.
}
----

As with `std::shared_ptr`, using `std::make_unique` avoids this pitfall.
It does not accept a pointer to an existing object but only creates a new one.

Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething(char const* data) {
  // Creating another unique_ptr
  auto p1 = std::make_unique<std::string>(data);
  // ...
  auto p2 = std::make_unique<std::string>(*p1); // Compliant: Creates a copy.

  // Transfering ownership
  auto p3 = std::make_unique<std::string>(data);
  auto p4 = std::move(p3); // Compliant: Will invoke move constructor, which is present in std::unique_ptr.
}
----

==== Out-of-scope access

Extra care must be taken when passing the memory address contained in an RAII object.

Both `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr` provide the `get` method to obtain a raw pointer to the contained memory.
This should only be used to read the data.
Passing this pointer to a function that might release it can lead to a "double-free" and "use-after-free".

\[~ann.campbell.2] the program's memory management data structures becomes corrupted because just after the first call to the free() statement this part of the heap memory can immediately be reused/reorganised for any other purpose. So by releasing twice the same memory location, you end up with a memory location used concurrently for two fully different purposes -> crash.

Eventually this rule should cover both double ``++free++`` _and_ double ``++delete++`` but the initial implementation will just be for C.
