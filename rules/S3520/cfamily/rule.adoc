Deallocating a memory location more than once leads to undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

Using `delete` or `free(...)` releases the reservation on a memory location, making it immediately available for another purpose.
Releasing the same memory location twice leads to undefined behavior and can often crash the program.

=== What is the potential impact

The effects of a "double-free" heavily depend on how the program's memory management is implemented.
In the case of such a scenario, one of the following can be observed:

- The program's memory-management data structures can become corrupted.
This will usually cause a crash.
- In specific circumstances, corruption of mentioned data structures can cause two later calls to malloc to return the same pointer.
This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
- The {cpp} standard defines the first `delete` call as the end of the lifetime for dynamically allocated memory.
Any access to that memory past its lifetime end, including another `delete`, is undefined behavior.

== How to fix it

Besides just ensuring that every release happens once, the following best practices can also be used:

- After a `delete` or `free`, set the pointer's value to `nullptr` or `NULL`.
`delete` of `nullptr` and `free` of `NULL` are defined as having no effect.
- Release any allocated memory in the function it was allocated in.

=== Code examples

Example for C:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char* cp = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    free(cp);
  }

  free(cp);  // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant Solution

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char* cp = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    free(cp);
    cp = NULL; // This will prewent freeing the same memory again
  }

  free(cp); // This is OK: if the memory was freed in the if-block above, free(NULL) is a no-op
  cp = NULL; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
}
----

Example for {cpp}:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  std::string* p = new std::string;

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    delete p;
  }

  delete p;  // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  std::string* p = new std::string;

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    delete p;
    p = nullptr; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
  }

  delete p; // This is OK: if the memory was freed in the if-block above, operator delete of nullptr is a no-op
  p = nullptr; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
}
----

=== Going the extra mile

{cpp}-11 introduced smart pointers.
By using these instead of manual memory management, most dynamic memory management issues can be mitigated.
This includes the issue of "double-free".

[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  auto p = std::make_unique<std::string>();

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    p.reset(); // Delete happens here.
  }

  // delete not called by std::unique_ptr destructor.
}

\[~freddy.mallet], what you've edited the description to say was my initial understanding of this problem, but every reference I could find said that a double free would https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html[corrupt the program's memory management data structures]. None of them said that it "only" made the memory available for reallocation.

\[~ann.campbell.2] the program's memory management data structures becomes corrupted because just after the first call to the free() statement this part of the heap memory can immediately be reused/reorganised for any other purpose. So by releasing twice the same memory location, you end up with a memory location used concurrently for two fully different purposes -> crash.

Eventually this rule should cover both double ``++free++`` _and_ double ``++delete++`` but the initial implementation will just be for C.

Euh for me [~ann.campbell.2], there is no doubt about the fact that this is a blocker BUG and not a blocker Code Smell.

You're right, of course [~freddy.mallet]. I struggle a little with the UI.
