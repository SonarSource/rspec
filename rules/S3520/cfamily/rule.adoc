== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++free(...)++`` or ``++delete++`` releases the reservation on a memory location, making it immediately available for another purpose. So releasing the same memory location twice can lead to corrupting the program's memory. 


A best practice to avoid this bug calls for setting just-freed pointers to ``++NULL++``, and always null-testing before a ``++free++`` or ``++delete++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char *cp = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    free(cp);
  }

  free(cp);  // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void doSomething(int size) {
  char *cp = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * size);

  // ...
  if (condition) {
    free(cp);
    cp = NULL; // This will prewent freeing the same memory again
  }

  free(cp); // This is OK: if the memory was freed in the if-block above, free(NULL) is a no-op
  cp = NULL; // This will prevent freeing the same memory again
}
----
