== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++return++``, ``++break++`` or ``++continue++`` in a ``++finally++`` block suppresses the propagation of any unhandled exception which was raised in the ``++try++``, ``++else++`` or ``++except++`` blocks. It will also ignore their return statements.


``https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit[SystemExit]`` is raised when ``++sys.exit()++`` is called. ``https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt[KeyboardInterrupt]`` is raised when the user asks the program to stop by pressing interrupt keys. Both exceptions are expected to propagate up until the application stops. It is ok to catch them when a clean-up is necessary but they should be raised again immediately. They should never be ignored.


If you need to ignore every other exception you can simply catch the ``++Exception++`` class. However you should be very careful when you do this as it will ignore other important exceptions such as ``https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError[MemoryError]``


In python 2 it is possible to raise old style classes. You can use a bare ``++except:++`` statement to catch every exception. Remember to still reraise ``++SystemExit++`` and ``++KeyboardInterrupt++``.


This rule raises an issue when a jump statement (``++break++``, ``++continue++``, ``++return++``) would force the control flow to leave a finally block.

def find_file_which_contains(expected_content, paths):
    file = None
    for path in paths:
        try:
            # "open" will raise IsADirectoryError if the provided path is a directory but it will be stopped by the  "return" and "continue"
            file = open(path, 'r')
            actual_content = file.read()
        except FileNotFoundError as exception:

            raise ValueError(f"'paths' should only contain existing files. File ${path} does not exist.")
        finally:

                # Note that "continue" is allowed in a "finally" block only since python 3.8
                continue  # Noncompliant. This will prevent exceptions raised by the "try" block and "except" block from raising.
            else:

    return None

# This will return None instead of raising IsADirectoryError from the "try" block
find_file_which_contains("some content", ["a_directory"])

Note: There is no need to create issues for ``++raise++`` statementsÂ because:
