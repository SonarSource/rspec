Using ``++return++``, ``++break++``, ``++throw++``, and so on from a ``++finally++`` block suppresses the propagation of any unhandled ``++Throwable++`` which was thrown in the ``++try++`` or ``++catch++`` block.


This rule raises an issue when a jump statement (``++break++``, ``++continue++``, ``++return++``, ``++throw++``, and ``++goto++``) would force control flow to leave a ``++finally++`` block.
