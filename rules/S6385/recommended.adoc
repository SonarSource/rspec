//==== Recommended Secure Coding Practices
Recommendations

* Apply the least privilege principle by creating a custom role with as few permissions as possible. 
* As custom role can be updated, gradually add atomic permissions when required.
* Limit the assignable scopes of the custom role to a set of Resources or Ressource Groups.
* When necessary, use the built-in Owner role instead of a custom role granting subscription owner capabilities. 
* Limit the assignments of Owner roles to less than three people or service principals.
