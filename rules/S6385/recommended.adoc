== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Apply the least privilege principle by creating a custom role with as few permissions as possible. 
* Add new permissions to a custom role when required instead of granting a large range of permission from the beginning.
* Limit the assignable scopes of the custom role to a set of Resources or Ressource Groups.
* When necessary, use the built-in Owner role instead of a custom role granting subscription owner capabilities. 
* Limit the assignments of Owner roles to less than 3 people or service principals.
