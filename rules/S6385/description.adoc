Azure Resource Manager allows to create custom roles that can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals.
A custom role thats grant access to all resources of a subsciption will have the same capabilities as the built-in Owner role.

It's recommender to limit the number of subscrition owners in order to mitigate the risk of being breached by a compromised owner.
Having custom role that grants subscription Owner capabilities makes it way more difficult to enforce this limitation.

This rule raise an issue when a custom role has an assignable scope set to a Subscription or a Management Group and allow all actions (``++*++``)
