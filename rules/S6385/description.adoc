== Why is this an issue?

Defining a custom role for a Subscription or a Management group that allows all actions will give them the same capabilities as the built-in Owner role.
It's recommended to limit the number of subscription owners in order to mitigate the risk of being breached by a compromised owner.

This rule raises an issue when a custom role has an assignable scope set to a Subscription or a Management Group and allows all actions (``++*++``)

Recommendations

* Apply the least privilege principle by creating a custom role with as few permissions as possible. 
* As custom role can be updated, gradually add atomic permissions when required.
* Limit the assignable scopes of the custom role to a set of Resources or Ressource Groups.
* When necessary, use the built-in Owner role instead of a custom role granting subscription owner capabilities. 
* Limit the assignments of Owner roles to less than three people or service principals.
