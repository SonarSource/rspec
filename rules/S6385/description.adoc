Defining a custom role for a Subscription or a Management group that allows all actions will give them the same capabilities as the built-in Owner role.

This rule raises an issue when a custom role has an assignable scope set to a Subscription or a Management Group and allows all actions (``++*++``).

To reduce the risk of intrusion of a compromised owner, it is recommended to limit the number of subscription owners.
