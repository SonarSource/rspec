=== Going the extra mile

Here is a list of recommendations that can be followed regarding good usage of
roles:

* Apply the least privilege principle by creating a custom role with as few
permissions as possible. 
* As custom roles can be updated, gradually add atomic permissions when 
required.
* Limit the assignable scopes of the custom role to a set of Resources or
Resource Groups.
* When necessary, use the built-in Owner role instead of a custom role granting
subscription owner capabilities. 
* Limit the assignments of Owner roles to less than three people or service
principals.
