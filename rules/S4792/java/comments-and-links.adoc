Note: For now we will not add support for configuration files.


However for the future this rule or another should also raise an issue on the first line of any file named ``++log4j2.xml++``, ``++log4j2-test.xml++``, ``++logback.xml++``, ``++logback-test.xml++``.

*Later* it would be great if it also raised an issue on the first line of files named

* ``++log4j2.json++``, ``++log4j2.jsn++``, ``++log4j2.yaml++``, ``++log4j2.yml++``, ``++log4j2.properties++``, ``++log4j2-test.json++``, ``++log4j2-test.jsn++``, ``++log4j2-test.yaml++``, ``++log4j2-test.yml++``, ``++log4j2-test.properties++``. See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Log4J 2 documentation ].
* ``++logback.groovy++`` See https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html[Logback documentation]

To investigate:

* ``++java.util.logging.LoggingMXBean#setLoggerLevel(String loggerName, String levelName)++`` could also be considered to raise an issue
* We could also raise issues for the logback library on classes extending ``++ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.Configurator++``
