``++CAST(... AS CHAR/VARCHAR)++`` can be a source of incompatibilities between database versions: the behavior of ``++CAST++`` may not be the same depending on the version of the database system. Such incompatibilities can cause unexpected output from applications that ``++CAST++`` decimal data to ``++CHAR++`` or ``++VARCHAR++``, it's therefore best to avoid using ``++CAST(... AS CHAR/VARCHAR)++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
  DELETE product
  WHERE CAST(status_code AS CHAR(2)) = '42' -- Noncompliant
