== Why is this an issue?

The use of `==` to compare two objects is expected to do a reference comparison. That is, it is expected to return `true` if and only if they are the same object instance. Overloading the operator to do anything else will inevitably lead to the introduction of bugs by callers. 

[source,csharp]
----
public static bool operator ==(MyType x, MyType y) // Noncompliant: confusing for the caller
{
    // custom implementation
}
----

On the other hand, overloading it to do exactly that is pointless; that's what `==` does by default.

[source,csharp]
----
public static bool operator ==(MyType x, MyType y) // Noncompliant: redundant 
{
    if (x == null)
    {
        return y == null;
    }
    
    return object.ReferenceEquals(x,y);
}
----

=== Exceptions

* Classes with overloaded `operator +` or `operator -` are ignored.
* Classes that implement `IComparable<T>` or `IEquatable<T>` most probably behave as a value-type objects and so are ignored.
