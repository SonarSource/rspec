When a back reference in a regex refers to a capturing group that hasn't been defined yet (or at all), it can never be matched. Named back references throw a ``++PatternSyntaxException++`` in that case; numeric back references fail silently when they can't match, simply making the match fail.


When the group is defined before the back reference but on a different control path (like in ``++(.)|\1++`` for example), this also leads to a situation where the back reference can never match.
