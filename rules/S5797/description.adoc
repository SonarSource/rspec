This rule raises an issue when a constant expression is used as a condition in an ``++if++``, ``++elif++``, a conditional expression or other boolean expressions.

== Why is this an issue?

When a constant is used as a condition, either it has no effect on the execution flow and it can be removed, or some code will never be executed and it is a bug.
