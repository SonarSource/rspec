When a constant is used as a condition, either it has no effect on the execution flow and it can be removed, or some code will never be executed and it is a bug.


This rule raises an issue when a constant expression is used as a condition in an ``++if++``, ``++elif++``, a conditional expression or other boolean expressions.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
def func(param = None):
    param = (1,)
    if param:  # Noncompliant. var is always set to (1,), the first branch of the if will always execute.
        return sum(param)
    else:
        return None

var2 = 1 if func else 2  # Noncompliant. "func" will always be equivalent to True.
var3 = func and 1 else 2  # Noncompliant.
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
def func(param = None):
    if param is None:
        param = (1,)
    if param:
        return sum(param)
    else:
        return None

var2 = 1 if func() else 2
var3 = func() and 1 else 2
----
