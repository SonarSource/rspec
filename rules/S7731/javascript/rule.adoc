This rule raises an issue when a traditional C-style for loop is used to iterate over an array when a for-of loop would be more appropriate.

== Why is this an issue?

Traditional for loops with manual index management are prone to off-by-one errors, which are among the most common bugs in software development. These errors occur when the loop condition is incorrectly specified (like using `<=` instead of `<`) or when array bounds are miscalculated.

Modern JavaScript provides the for-of loop syntax, which eliminates the need for manual index management. This approach is:

* Safer: No risk of off-by-one errors since there's no manual index arithmetic
* More readable: The intent to iterate over array elements is clearer
* Less error-prone: No need to remember array.length or worry about loop conditions

When you need both the index and the element, you can use `array.entries()` with destructuring assignment, which still avoids manual index management while providing both values.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using traditional for loops increases the risk of off-by-one errors that can lead to:

* Array index out of bounds errors
* Infinite loops or premature loop termination
* Logic errors that cause incorrect program behavior
* Reduced code maintainability due to more complex loop logic

=== How to fix?


Replace the traditional for loop with a for-of loop when you only need the array elements.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    const element = array[index]; // Noncompliant
    console.log(element);
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
for (const element of array) {
    console.log(element);
}
