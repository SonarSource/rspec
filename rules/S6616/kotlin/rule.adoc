FIXME: add a description

// If you want to factorize the description uncomment the following line and create the file.
//include::../description.adoc[]

== Why is this an issue?

In Kotlin, lambdas with a single parameter have an implicit parameter name `it`. Thatâ€™s why using `it` as a parameter name in lambdas is actually duplicating the compiler work and thus is a code smell.


== How to fix it
The simplest solution will be to just remove the parameter declaration and the arrow. This way, you can still refer to the parameter with `it`.
Another possible solution could be to give your lambda parameter another meaningful name. This will also increase the readability.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,text,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
listOf(1, 2, 3).forEach { it -> it.and(6) } // Noncompliant
listOf(1, 2, 3).forEach { it: Int -> it.and(6) } // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,text,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
listOf(1, 2, 3).forEach { it.and(6) } // Compliant
----

The only exception to this rule is the situation when the compiler is not able to dermine the type
