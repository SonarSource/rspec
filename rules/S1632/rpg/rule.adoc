Historically ``++/COPY++`` procedures contained all of the specifications required for each procedure, so for example ``++xxxxF /COPY++`` would be used to copy the F lines from another ``++F++`` spec. However, this practice results in code that is difficult to understand and maintain. Instead, the use of ``++/COPY++`` statements should be replaced with explicit declarations.


== Noncompliant Code Example

Given the default list of specs, H,F,I,D,C,O:
