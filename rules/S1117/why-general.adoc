== Why is this an issue?

Variable shadowing happens when a variable declared in a specific scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope.

To avoid these problems, rename the shadowing, shadowed, or both variables to accurately represent their purpose with unique and meaningful names.
It improves clarity and allows reasoning locally about the code without considering other software parts.
