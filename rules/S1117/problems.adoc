This can lead to three main problems:

* Confusion:
  The same name can refer to different variables in different parts of the scope, making the code hard to read and understand.

* Unintended Behavior:
  You might accidentally use the wrong variable, leading to hard-to-detect bugs.

* Maintenance Issues:
  If the inner variable is removed or renamed, the code's behavior might change unexpectedly because the outer variable is now being used.
