Dangerous `chmod` options can lead to unauthorized actions over file system
resources.

All users were given write or execute permissions to a file system resource.
The least-privilege policy should be adopted where possible to prevent
unauthorized access.

The affected file system resource might contain sensitive information that
could allow attackers to disrupt services or elevate privileges in the
resulting Docker containers. +
A malicious actor that gets access to such resource could use it to their
advantage.

To be secure, remove the unnecessary permissions. If required, use `--chown` to
set the target user and group.
