If you're using a ``++struct++``, it is likely because you're interested in performance. But by failing to implement ``++IEquatable<T>++`` you're loosing performance when comparisons are made because without ``++IEquatable<T>++``, boxing and reflection are used to make comparisons. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
struct MyStruct  // Noncompliant
{
  private int i;
  public int I
  {
    //...
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
struct MyStruct : IEquatable<MyStruct>
{
  private int i;
  public int I
  {
    //...
  }

  public bool Equals(MyStruct other)
  {
    throw new NotImplementedException();
  }
}
