== Why is this an issue?

React has a special prop called `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` that allows you to assign a raw HTML string to the underlying DOM `innerHTML` property. Changing `innerHTML` will replace the element's child nodes or text content. For this reason, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` should never be used together with component `children` as they will conflict with each other, both trying to set the inner content of the same element.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function MyComponent() {
    return ( // Noncompliant: don't use children and dangerouslySetInnerHTML at the same time 
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "HTML" }}>
            Children
        </div>
    );
}
----

To fix the issue leave either the element's `children` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, but not both.

    return (
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "HTML" }} />

}
