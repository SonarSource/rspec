== Why is this an issue?

The optional chaining operator `?.` allows to access a deeply nested property, returning `undefined` if the property or any intermediate object is `undefined`.

This usually means that the expression is expected to evaluate as `undefined` in some cases. Therefore, using the optional chaining operator in a context where returning `undefined` is forbidden can lead to errors.

[source,javascript]
----
new (foo?.bar)();           // Noncompliant: when 'foo' does not have 'bar' property TypeError is thrown
const { foo } = bar?.baz;   // Noncompliant: when 'bar' does not have 'baz' property TypeError is thrown
const foo = [...bar?.baz]   // Noncompliant: when 'bar' does not have 'baz' property TypeError is thrown
----

Since optional chaining represents multiple execution branches, having an error thrown in such a context can be hard to debug.

== How to fix it

In order to prevent runtime errors, you should provide fallbacks for when the optional chaining operator short-circuits to `undefined`.

Possible solutions would be:

* Nullish coalescing operator `??`
[source,javascript]
----
new (foo?.bar ?? baz)()
----
* Logical OR operator `||`
[source,javascript]
----
const { foo } = bar?.baz || {}
----
* Ternary operator `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`

[source,javascript]
----
const foo = bar?.baz ? [...bar.baz] : []
----
