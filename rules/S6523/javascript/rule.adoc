== Why is this an issue?

The optional chaining operator `?.` allows to access a deeply nested property, returning `undefined` if the property or any intermediate object is `undefined`.

This usually means that the expression is expected to evaluate as `undefined` in some cases. Therefore, using the optional chaining operator in a context where returning `undefined` is forbidden can lead to errors.

[source,javascript]
----
(event?.callback)(); // Noncompliant: when 'event' does not have 'callback' property TypeError is thrown
const { code } = event?.error; // Noncompliant: when 'event' does not have 'error' property TypeError is thrown
func(...event?.values); // Noncompliant: when 'event' does not have 'values' property TypeError is thrown
----

Since optional chaining represents multiple execution branches, having an error thrown in such a context can be hard to debug.

== How to fix it?

In order to prevent runtime errors, you should provide fallbacks for when the optional chaining operator short-circuits to `undefined`.

* Nullish coalescing operator `??`
[source,javascript]
----
(event?.callback ?? defaultCallback)();
----
* Logical OR operator `||`
[source,javascript]
----
(event?.callback || defaultCallback)();
----
* Ternary operator `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`

[source,javascript]
----
(event?.callback ? event?.callback : defaultCallback)();
----
