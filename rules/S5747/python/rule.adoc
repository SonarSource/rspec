This rule raises an issue when a bare raise` statement is not in an `except` or `finally` block.

== Why is this an issue?

A bare `raise` statement, i.e. a `raise` with no exception provided, will re-raise the last active exception in the current scope:

[source,python]
----
def foo():
    try:
        ...
    except ValueError as e:
        raise # this will re-raise "e"
----

If the `raise` statement is not in an `except` or `finally` block, no exception is active and a `RuntimeError` is raised instead.

If the bare `raise` statement is in a function called in an `except` block, the exception caught by the `except` will be re-raised. However, this behavior is not reliable as nothing prevents a developer from calling the function from a different context. Overall, this pattern is discouraged as it is hard to understand and maintain.


== How to fix it

To fix this issue, make sure to specify which exception needs to be raised when outside of an `except` block.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
raise  # Noncompliant: no active exception

def foo():
    raise  # Noncompliant: no active exception
    try:
        raise  # Noncompliant: no active exception
    except ValueError as e:
        handle_error()
    except:
        raise
    finally:
        raise

def handle_error():
    raise  # Noncompliant: this is not reliable
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
raise ValueError()

def foo():
    raise ValueError()
    try:
        raise ValueError()
    except:
        raise
    finally:
        raise
----

=== Pitfalls

In a `finally` block, an exception is still active only when it hasn't been caught in a previous `except` clause or if it has been raised in an `except` block. In both cases, it is better to let the exception propagate automatically than to re-raise it. This pattern is covered by rule S5704.
