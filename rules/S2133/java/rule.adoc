== Why is this an issue?

Creating an object for the sole purpose of calling ``++getClass++`` on it is a waste of memory and cycles. Instead, simply use the class' ``++.class++`` property.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
MyObject myOb = new MyObject();  // Noncompliant
Class c = myOb.getClass(); 
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
Class c = MyObject.class; 
----
