*Note:* the ``++@ComponentScan++`` is implicit in the ``++@SpringBootApplication++`` annotation, case in which Spring Boot will auto scan for components in the package containing the ``++@SpringBoot++`` main class and its sub packages.


*Out of scope:*  usage of filters to customize scanning, e.g.:

----
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "org.example",

        excludeFilters = @Filter(Repository.class))

This rule should never be in the Default Profile because:

* it ignores XML _component-scan_ configuration
* it's perfectly valid to have project A with a @Component class which is not actually consumed in project A. And then project B declares in a @ComponentScan configuration class the package from Project A, and consumes it as a dependency. Everything will work just fine, even if the code for project A is totally separate from the code from project B.

A more compliant solution would be to remove the `@ComponentScan` directive altogether and use `@SpringBootApplication`. This way `com.mycompany.app` is used. This also helps with slice tests where the appropriate filter will be configured automatically.
