== Why is this an issue?

Spring beans belonging to packages that are not included in a ``++@ComponentScan++`` configuration will not be accessible in the Spring Application Context. Therefore, it's likely to be a configuration mistake that will be detected by this rule. 


*Note:* the ``++@ComponentScan++`` is implicit in the ``++@SpringBootApplication++`` annotation, case in which Spring Boot will auto scan for components in the package containing the Spring Boot main class and its sub-packages.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
package com.mycompany.app;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.mycompany.app.beans")
public class Application {
...
}

package com.mycompany.app.web; 

@Controller
public class MyController { // Noncompliant; MyController belong to "com.mycompany.app.web" while the ComponentScan is looking for beans in "com.mycompany.app.beans" package
...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
package com.mycompany.app;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan({"com.mycompany.app.beans","com.mycompany.app.web"})
or
@ComponentScan("com.mycompany.app")
or
@ComponentScan
public class Application {
...
}

package com.mycompany.app.web; 

@Controller
public class MyController { // "com.mycompany.app.web" is referenced by a @ComponentScan annotated class
...
}
