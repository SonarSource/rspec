PL/I, unlike many other programming languages, does not reserve any word's usage.

This implies that it is syntaxically valid to use the keyword ``++IF++`` as variable names for instance.

But doing so results in confusing code which is hard to read, especially in editors without proper PL/I syntax highlighting support.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
foo: proc options(main);
  declare if fixed decimal init (42); /* Non-Compliant */

  if if = 42 then do; /* Cconfusing */
    put list ('if = 42');
  end;

  go to goto; /* Confusing */

  goto: /* Non-Compliant */
  ;
end;
