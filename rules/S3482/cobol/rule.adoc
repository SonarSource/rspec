== Why is this an issue?

While it is possible to manually set a primary key value, doing so almost guarantees a key clash at some point. Instead, primary key values should be set by (in descending order of desirability):

* automatic generation by the database via a column definition such as ``++PROD_ID INT NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1, NO CACHE)++``
* the ``++Generate_Unique()++`` function
* a value pulled directly from a sequence, like so: ``++nextval for SEQ_PRODUCT++``

This rule raises an issue when an ``++INSERT++`` statement assigns values to identity columns that are configured to always generate their values.


*Note* That this rule raises issues only when a database catalog is provided during the SonarQube analysis.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
CREATE table my_table (
     column_a integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY primary key not null,
     column_b varchar(50)
);

INSERT into my_table (column_a, column_b)
VALUES (1, 'Hello World');  -- Noncompliant
