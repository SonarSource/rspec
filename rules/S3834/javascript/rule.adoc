== Why is this an issue?

``++Symbol++`` is a primitive type introduced in ECMAScript2015. Its instances are mainly used as unique property keys.

An instance can only be created by using ``++Symbol++`` as a function. Using ``++Symbol++`` with the ``++new++`` operator will raise a ``++TypeError++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
const sym = new Symbol("foo");   // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
const sym = Symbol("foo");
----
