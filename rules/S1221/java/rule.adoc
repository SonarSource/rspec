Naming a method ``++tostring++``, ``++hashcode++`` or ``++equal++`` is either:


* A bug in the form of a typo. Overriding ``++toString++``, ``++Object.hashCode()++`` (note the camelCasing) or ``++Object.equals++`` (note the 's' on the end) was meant, and the application does not behave as expected.
* Done on purpose. The name however will confuse every other developer, who may not notice the naming difference, or who will think it is a bug.

In both cases, the method should be renamed.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public int hashcode() { /* ... */ }  // Noncompliant

public String tostring() { /* ... */ } // Noncompliant

public boolean equal(Object obj) { /* ... */ }  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
@Override
public int hashCode() { /* ... */ }

@Override
public String toString() { /* ... */ }

@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) { /* ... */ }
