When calling ``++delete++`` on an object of incomplete type, the calling code does not have enough information to do the action properly (it does not know if this object has a trivial or a nontrivial destructor, if it has overloaded the ``++delete++`` operator...). Therefore, deleting a pointer to such an object can lead to undefined behavior.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class Body;

class Handle {
  public:
    Handle();
    ~Handle() { 
      delete impl; // Noncompliant, Body is incomplete
    }
  private:
    Body * impl;
};
----


== Compliant Solution

----
// In header file
class Body;

class Handle { 
  public: 
    Handle(); 
    ~Handle();
    // Add other special member functions to respect the rule of five
  private: 
    Body * impl;
};

// In implementation file
#include "Handle.h"
#include "Body.h" // Now Body is complete 

Handle::~Handle(){ 
  delete impl; // Compliant, at this point "Body" is a complete class
}
----

Or, with modern resource handling:

----
// In header file
class Body;

class Handle { 
  public: 
    Handle();
    ~Handle();
  private: 
    std::unique_ptr<Body> impl; //Compliant
};

// In implementation file
#include "Handle.h"
#include "Body.h" // Now Body is complete 

Handle::Handle() : impl{new Body{}} {}
Handle::~Handle() = default; // since "Body" is complete, it can be destroyed by unique_ptr
