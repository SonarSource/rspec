This rule raises an issue when a template string is used without being processed by a template processing function.

== Why is this an issue?

Template strings, or t-strings, are a Python 3.14+ feature that creates `Template`
objects, not regular strings. Unlike f-strings that immediately evaluate to
strings, t-strings require explicit processing by a template processing
function to be useful.

When you use a t-string without processing it, you get a `Template` object that
doesn't have a meaningful string representation. This is almost always
unintentional, as developers typically expect string-like behavior similar to
f-strings.

The `Template` object contains the static string parts and interpolated values
separately, allowing for advanced string processing, security checks, and
domain-specific language implementations. However, to get the final string
output, you must pass the template to a processing function.

Using an unprocessed template string can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, such as printing object representations instead of formatted strings, or passing the wrong type to functions that expect strings.


=== How to fix?


Process the template string using a template processing function. You can create a simple processing function that mimics f-string behavior, or use more sophisticated processing for advanced use cases.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
name = "World"
template = t"Hello {name}"
print(template)  # Noncompliant: prints Template object representation
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
name = "World"
template = t"Hello {name}"
print(process_template(template))  # Process the template first

def process_template(template):
    from my_lib import html
    return html(template)
