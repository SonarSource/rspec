== Why is this an issue?

Generic types shouldn't be used raw (without type parameters) in variable declarations or return values. Doing so bypasses generic type checking, and defers the catch of unsafe code to runtime.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
List myList; // Noncompliant 
Set mySet; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
List<String> myList;
Set<? extends Number> mySet;
----
