The use of comparison operators (``++<++``, ``++<=++``, ``++>=++``, ``++>++``) with strings is not likely to yield the expected results. Make sure the intention was to compare strings and not numbers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
var appleNumber = "123";
var orangeNumber = "45";
if (appleNumber < orangeNumber) {  // Noncompliant, this condition is true
  alert("There are more oranges");
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
var appleNumber = "123";
var orangeNumber = "45";
if (Number(appleNumber) < Number(orangeNumber)) {
  alert("There are more oranges");
}
----


== Exceptions

The rule ignores string comparisons occurring in the callback of a sort invocation, e.g.:

----
const fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'banana'];
fruits.sort((a, b) => a < b);
