This rule raises an issue when explicit no-argument constructors are used to create collections like `new ArrayList()`, `new HashMap()`, or `new HashSet()`.

== Why is this an issue?

Groovy provides concise collection literals that are more idiomatic and readable than explicit constructor calls. Using collection literals is a fundamental aspect of writing idiomatic Groovy code.

Explicit constructor calls like `new ArrayList()` are verbose and follow Java conventions rather than embracing Groovy's more expressive syntax. Collection literals not only reduce code verbosity but also make the intent clearer and the code more maintainable.

For example, `[]` immediately communicates "empty list" while `new ArrayList()` requires the reader to understand the constructor call and its implications. Similarly, `[:]` clearly represents an empty map, while `new HashMap()` is more verbose and less intuitive.

Groovy's collection literals also provide consistency across different collection types, making the codebase more uniform and easier to read for developers familiar with Groovy idioms.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using explicit constructors instead of collection literals makes the code more verbose and less idiomatic. This reduces code readability and maintainability, especially for developers familiar with Groovy conventions. While functionally equivalent, the verbose syntax can make the codebase harder to scan and understand quickly.

== How to fix it

Replace explicit constructor calls with Groovy collection literals. Use `[]` for lists, `[:]` for maps, and type coercion with `as` for specific collection types.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def list = new ArrayList() // Noncompliant
def map = new HashMap() // Noncompliant
def set = new HashSet() // Noncompliant
def queue = new LinkedList() // Noncompliant
def sortedSet = new TreeSet() // Noncompliant
def stack = new Stack() // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
def list = []
def map = [:]
def set = [] as Set
def queue = [] as Queue
def sortedSet = [] as SortedSet
def stack = [] as Stack
----
