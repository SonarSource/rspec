== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

If an attacker gains access to an SSLMate secret, they might be able to gain access to the SSL/TLS certificate of organisations.

=== What is the potential impact?

SSLMate provides APIs used by organizations to issue and monitor SSL/TLS certificates.
These certificates guaranty the authenticity of the organization's servers, and the confidentiality of the data exchanged with them.
Depending on the permission granted to the API key, an attacker could potentially create, revoke, or modify SSL/TLS certificates of the organization.

Creating certificates would allow attackers to impersonate the organization's servers. This leads to Man-In-The-Middle attacks that would
affect both the confidentiality and integrity of the communications from clients
to that server.

== How to fix it

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/revoke.adoc[]

Also, revoke certificates that were issued since the leak. Doing so
will ensure that all people and assets that rely on these certificates are aware of its compromise and stop trusting it.
