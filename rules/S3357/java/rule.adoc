== Why is this an issue?

``++@Stateful++`` EJB's are designed to maintain user state through a multi-step process. When that process is over, you must be sure to call the bean's ``++@Remove++`` method to remove the bean from the container. Otherwise, bean instances will hang around in memory until their sessions time out, potentially causing resource problems.

This looks to me like a valuable rule (it came from a customer request) but it will be eons until we can implement it. In the meantime, I'm reluctant to construct the elaborate code sample that will be required to demonstrate the issue without having a better idea of what it will look like when we do implement and/or how accurately we'll be able to attach the issue.
