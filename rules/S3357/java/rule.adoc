``++@Stateful++`` EJB's are designed to maintain user state through a multi-step process. When that process is over, you must be sure to call the bean's ``++@Remove++`` method to remove the bean from the container. Otherwise, bean instances will hang around in memory until their sessions time out, potentially causing resource problems.
