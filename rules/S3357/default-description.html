<p><code>@Stateful</code> EJB&#8217;s are designed to maintain user state through a multi-step process. When that process is over, you must be sure to call the bean&#8217;s <code>@Remove</code> method to remove the bean from the container. Otherwise, bean instances will hang around in memory until their sessions time out, potentially causing resource problems.</p>

<p>This looks to me like a valuable rule (it came from a customer request) but it will be eons until we can implement it. In the meantime, I&#8217;m reluctant to construct the elaborate code sample that will be required to demonstrate the issue without having a better idea of what it will look like when we do implement and/or how accurately we&#8217;ll be able to attach the issue.</p>
