== Why is this an issue?

In Dart, there's a way to declare a lazy initialization of variables. This might be needed if the variable might not be needed and its the initialization is costly. In such case lazy evaluations can reduce time/memory consumption. Another use case is an instance variable needs access to `this` and can't be initialized on the way.

Sometimes, `late` modifier is used to tell the compiler that a variable or field is non-nullable and will be initialized later. This is needed when compiler failed to detect it during the control flow analysis.

In case of static and top-level variables, there's no need to declare them `late`, if they contain initialization. They are already evaluated lazily, so `late` is redundant.

== How to fix it

Remove the `late` modifier.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
late int topLevel = 42; // Noncompliant

class NonCompliant {
  static late String abc = 'ABC'; // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int topLevel = 42;

class NonCompliant {
  static String abc = 'ABC';
}
----
