Each function and procedure should be documented with a comment either just before or right after the ``++IS++`` or ``++AS++`` keyword it to explain its goal and how it works. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
CREATE FUNCTION my_function RETURN PLS_INTEGER AS
BEGIN
  RETURN 42;
END;
/

CREATE PACKAGE my_package AS

PROCEDURE my_procedure;

FUNCTION my_function RETURN PLS_INTEGER;

END my_package;
/
----


== Compliant Solution

----
CREATE FUNCTION my_function RETURN PLS_INTEGER AS
-- Computes the meaning of life
BEGIN
  RETURN 42;
END;
/

CREATE PACKAGE my_package AS

-- This is documentation
PROCEDURE my_procedure;

/*
  This is documentation
*/
FUNCTION my_function RETURN PLS_INTEGER;

END my_package;
/
----


== Exceptions

Functions are procedures declared in package bodies, and anonymous PL/SQL blocks do not have to be documented.


----
DECLARE
  PROCEDURE helper_procedure AS
  BEGIN
    NULL;
  END;
BEGIN
  helper_procedure;
END;
/

CREATE PACKAGE my_package AS

-- This is documentation
PROCEDURE public_procedure;

END my_package;
/

CREATE PACKAGE BODY my_package AS

PROCEDURE helper_procedure AS
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;

PROCEDURE public_procedure AS
BEGIN
  helper_procedure;
END;

END my_package;
