== Why is this an issue?

Subtraction of iterators only gives well-defined results if the two iterators point into the same data structure in memory (same array, same object...).

This rule also applies to the particular case of pointers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f(std::vector<int> &v1, std::vector<int> &v2) {
  auto it = std::find(v1.begin(), v1.end(), 42);
  if (it != v1.end()) {
    auto index = it - v2.begin(); // Noncompliant, iterators from different containers
  }
}

void g(int val){
  int a[10];
  for (int &i : a){
    if (val == i) {
        auto index = &val - &a[0]; // Noncompliant, &val and &a[0] don't point in the same object
    }
  }
}

----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f(std::vector<int> &v1) {
  auto it = std::find(v1.begin(), v1.end(), 42);
  if (it != v1.end()) {
    auto index = it - v1.begin(); // Compliant
  } 
}

void g(int val){
  int a[10];
  for (int &i : a){
    if (val == i) {
        auto index = &i - &a[0]; // Compliant
    }
  }
}

\[~samuel.mercier] the message you've given assumes that the subtraction is being done in the context of arrays. That could be the case, but a context of unrelated pointers is equally likely.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I updated the description. In c arrays are just unassignable pointers with an allocated memory region. So it is probably fine to use pointer when the type is actually an array.

\[~amelie.renard] I suggest: Pointers or iterators subtracted from each other should apply to the same object
