=== What is the potential impact?

Not verifying user access strictly can introduce significant security risks. Some of the most prominent risks are listed below. Depending on the use case, it is very likely that other risks are introduced on top of the ones listed.

==== Unauthorized access

As the access of users is not checked strictly, it becomes very easy for an attacker to gain access to restricted areas or functionalities, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive resources. They may exploit this access to perform malicious actions, such as modifying or deleting data, impersonating legitimate users, or gaining administrative privileges, ultimately compromising the security of the system.

==== Theft of sensitive data

Theft of sensitive data can result from incorrect access control if attackers manage to gain access to databases, file systems, or other storage mechanisms where sensitive data is stored. This can lead to the theft of personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, or other confidential information. The stolen data can be used for various malicious purposes, such as identity theft, financial fraud, or selling the data on the black market, causing significant harm to individuals and organizations affected by the breach.
