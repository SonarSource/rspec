Access control is a critical aspect of web frameworks that ensures proper authorization and restricts access to sensitive resources or actions. To enable access control, web frameworks offer components that are responsible for evaluating user permissions and making access control decisions. They might examine the user's credentials, such as roles or privileges, and compare them against predefined rules or policies to determine whether the user should be granted access to a specific resource or action.

Conventionally, these checks should never grant access to every request received. If an endpoint or component is meant to be public, then it should be ignored by access control components. Conversely, if an endpoint should deny some users from accessing it, then access control has to be configured correctly for this endpoint.

Granting unrestricted access to all users can lead to security vulnerabilities and potential misuse of critical functionalities. It is important to carefully assess access decisions based on factors such as user roles, resource sensitivity, and business requirements. Implementing a robust and granular access control mechanism is crucial for the security and integrity of the web application itself and its surrounding environment.
