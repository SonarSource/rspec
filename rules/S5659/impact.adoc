=== What is the potential impact?

When a JSON Web Token is not appropriately signed with a strong cipher algorithm
or is unsigned, it becomes a significant threat to data security and the privacy
of user identities.

==== Impersonation of users

JWTs are commonly used to represent user authorization claims. They contain
information about the user's identity, user roles, and access rights. When these
tokens are not securely signed, it allows an attacker to forge them. In essence,
a weak or missing signature gives an attacker the power to craft a token that
could impersonate any user. For instance, they could create a token for an
administrator account, gaining access to high-level permissions and sensitive
data.

==== Unauthorized data access

When a JWT is not securely signed, it can be tampered with by an attacker, and
the integrity of the data it carries cannot be trusted. An attacker can
manipulate the content of the token and grant themselves permissions they should
not have, leading to unauthorized data access.
