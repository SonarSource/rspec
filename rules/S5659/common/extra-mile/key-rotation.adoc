==== Rotate your secret keys

Even with the strongest cipher algorithms, there is a risk that your secret keys
may be compromised. Therefore, it is a good practice to periodically rotate your
secret keys. By doing so, you limit the amount of time that an attacker can
misuse a stolen key. When you rotate keys, be sure to allow a grace period where
tokens signed with the old key are still accepted to prevent service disruptions.
