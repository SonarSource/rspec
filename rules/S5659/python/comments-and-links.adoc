The first code example of the current description of the RSPEC links to https://github.com/GehirnInc/python-jwt but this is another JWT implementation.

 There are multiple JWT implementations in Python with very similar names and they sometimes use the same namespace...

* PyJWT: https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt
 https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[doc]

 This is the one which matches the first code example of the current description.

 https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v2-0-0[Starting with version 2.0], the verify param of the decode function was dropped and replaced with

----
jwt.decode(encoded, key, options={"verify_signature": False}){code}

 * [https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt]
 This is the one which has a process_jwt function.
{quote}From version 2.0.1 the namespace has changed from jwt to python_jwt, in order to avoid conflict with PyJWT.

 * [https://github.com/GehirnInc/python-jwt]
 This implementation is wrongly linked in the current description of the ticket.
 It's actually not covered by the current description of the RSPEC.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] thanks, good catch! Luckily I only confused the links, the first one was supposed to be PyJWT (as that one is used much more often). I will change the name of the rule.


That are nice examples for the exceptions. While they are of course secure I think it might be fine to still raise this issue since there is no reason to not check for the right type of exception (e.g. ``++jwt.InvalidSignatureError++``). The intention of this specification is though to detect cases where the invalid signature exception is caught accidentally.

I have removed the exception case for now.
