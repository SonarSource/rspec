JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), a popular method of securely transmitting information
between parties as a JSON object, can become a significant security risk when
they are not properly signed with a robust cipher algorithm, left unsigned
altogether, or if the signature is not verified.
This vulnerability class allows malicious actors to craft fraudulent tokens,
effectively impersonating user identities. In essence, the integrity of a JWT
hinges on the strength and presence of its signature.
