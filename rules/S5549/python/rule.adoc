When a function is called, it accepts only one value per parameter. Python interpreters will raise a SyntaxError when they see something like ``++myfunction(a=1, a=2)++``, but there are other cases which will only fail at runtime:

* An argument is provided by value and position at the same time.
* Some arguments are provided via unpacking and the same argument is provided twice.

This rule raises an issue when a function is called with multiple values for the same parameter.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
def func(a, b, c):
    return a * b * c

func(6, 93, 31, c=62) # Noncompliant: argument "c" is duplicated

params = {'c':31}
func(6, 93, 31, **params) # Noncompliant: argument "c" is duplicated
func(6, 93, c=62, **params) # Noncompliant: argument "c" is duplicated
----


== Compliant Solution

----
def func(a, b, c):
    return a * b * c

print(func(c=31, b=93, a=6)) # Compliant
