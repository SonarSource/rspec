This rule raises issues for overloaded binary mathematical and relational operators that are not declared as hidden friends.

== Why is this an issue?

When overloading binary or relational operators, it is recommended that they be declared hidden friends of the class.

=== The hidden friend pattern

The hidden friend pattern consists of declaring and defining a function directly as a friend inside the class body. This reduces the function's visibility to argument-dependent lookup only. Approximately, such a function is considered only when called on an object of the enclosing class.

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyClass {
  friend void function(MyClass const& arg) { // This function is a hidden friend of MyClass
    ...
  }
};
----

=== Benefits of hidden friends

Using hidden friends provides the following benefits:

* in contrast to the member function, it allows conversion to be applied to both operands
* in contrast to free functions, it is considered only if one of the operands is an object of the given class

This rule raises issues for these overloaded binary operators:

* mathematical operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`
* until {cpp}20, all relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, ``++<=++``, ``++>=++``
* since {cpp}20, non-members key relational operators: `==`, ``++<=>++``

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyClass {
  MyClass operator+(const MyClass& rhs) // Noncompliant
  { /* ... */ }
};

bool operator==(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass& rhs) // Noncompliant
{ /* ... */ }
----


=== Why are hidden friends preferred over free functions?

The overloaded operators that are declared as hidden friends are found only by argument-dependent lookup (ADL) for a given class.
Roughly, this means that the hidden friend of class `C` is considered a candidate
only if one of the arguments of the call is an object of type `C` or one derived from it.
In contrast, a free function is considered for any class declared in the same namespace.

For illustration, let's consider the following example which defines `operator/` as a free function.
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
namespace lib {
  class Path {
  public:
    Path(char const*);
    Path(std::string_view);
    Path& operator/=(Path const&);
  };

  Path operator/(Path const& lhs, Path const& rhs) {
    auto result = lhs;
    result /= rhs;
    return result;
  }
}
----

The `operator/` will be considered as a candidate for any call `a / b`
when either `a` or `b` are of a type declared in the namespace `lib`.
This not only makes compilation slower but also lists the function as a candidate in case of a compilation error,
making such a message less readable.

Furthermore, when such an operator is visible via normal lookup, it may be invoked when both arguments are of the type that is convertible to `lib::Path`.
This may happen for code in the `lib` namespace or after using `using namespace lib;`.
However, such code will not compile or, even worse, select different overloads when placed in a different namespace.

[source,cpp]
----
namespace lib {
  void insideLib(std::string_view sv) {
    sv / "dir"; // Compiles, converts both arg to lib::Path
  }
} // namespace lib

namespace otherNS {
  void withoutUsing(std::string_view sv) {
    sv / "dir"; // Either does not compile or calls a different operator
  }
  void withUsing(std::string_view sv) {
    using namespace lib;
    sv / "dir"; // Compiles, converts both arg to lib::Path
  }
} // namespace otherNS
----

Such conversion for both arguments will not be allowed when the operator is declared as a hidden friend,
as none of the operands are of `lib::Path` type:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
namespace lib {
  class Path {
  public:
    Path(char const*);
    Path(std::string_view);
    Path& operator/=(Path const&);

    friend Path operator/(Path const& lhs, Path const& rhs) {
      auto result = lhs;
      result /= rhs;
      return result;
    }
  };
}
----

=== Why are hidden friends preferred over member functions?

When the overloaded operator is declared as a class member,
it can be invoked only for objects of that class or classes derived from it.
These restrictions also apply when operator syntax (`a op b`) is used
and disallows implicit conversion for left operands while allowing them for right operands.

For example, given the object `i` of class `Integer` that defines
`operator+` as a member:
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Integer {
public:
  Integer(long long int);
  Integer& operator+=(Integer const& rhs);
  Integer operator+(Integer const& rhs) const { // Noncompliant
    Integer res = *this;
    res += rhs;
    return res;
  }
};
----
The call `i + 10` is well-formed and resolves to `i.operator+(10)`,
which will convert `10` to an `Integer` object using the implicit converting constructor.
However, `10 + i` is ill-formed.

If hidden friend functions were used, the expressions `i + 10` and `10 + i`,
would resolve to `operator+(i, 10)` and `operator+(10, i)` respectively,
allowing conversion to be performed symmetrically on the integer literal.
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Integer {
public:
  Integer(long long int);
  Integer& operator+=(Integer const& rhs);
  friend Integer operator+(Integer const& lhs, Integer const& rhs) { // Compliant
    Integer res = lhs;
    res += rhs;
    return res;
  }
};
----


=== Why relational operators are treated differently since {cpp}20?

{cpp}20 has introduced a three-way comparison operator ``++<=>++`` (also known as spaceship)
in addition to the mechanism that considers additional functions when interpreting relational operations:

* `a < b` (also `>`, ``++<=++``, ``++>=++``) is also interpreted as ``++operator<=>(a, b) < 0++``, ``++a.operator<=>(b) < 0++``, or ``++0 < operator<=>(b, a)++``, ``++0 < b.operator<=>(a)++``,
* `a != b` is also intepreted as `!operator==(a, b)`, `!a.operator==(b)`, or `!operator==(b, a)`, `!b.operator==(a)`,
* `a == b` is also intepreted as `operator==(a, b)`, `a.operator==(b)`, or  `operator==(b, a)`, `b.operator==(a)`.

The above mechanism makes overloads for `!=`, `<`, `>`, ``++<=++``, ``++>=++`` replacable with ``++<=>++`` and `==` (see S6187).
As these overloads will usually be removed, we do not suggest replacing them with hidden friends.

Additionally, such rewrites consider calls of overloads with the order of argument as spelled (`a`, `b`), and reversed (`b`, `a`).
This makes the behavior of expression consistent regardless of the order of operands.
Given the following example:

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyString {
  MyString(char const* cstr);
  bool 
  operator==(MyString const& other) const;  // Compliant since C++20: see below
  
  std::strong_ordering 
  operator<=>(MyString const& other) const; // Compliant: only available since C++20
};

const MySting ms;
----

The expression `ms == "Some string"` and `"SomeString" == ms` both compile,
and the latter calls `operator==` with the argument reversed.
This removes the drawbacks of declaring all combinations of such operators as members,
and the issue is not raised for them for {cpp}20 and later.

Note, that hidden friends are still preferred over free functions:
[source,cpp]
----
struct MyString {
  MyString(char const* cstr);
};

bool 
operator==(MyString const& lhs, MyString const& rhs)  // Noncompliant
{ /* ... */ }

std::strong_ordering 
operator<=>(MyString const& lhs, MyString const& rhs) // Noncompliant
{ /* ... */ }
----

== How to fix it

The issue can be fixed by declaring the operator as a hidden friend,
i.e., declaring it as a `friend` inside the class and inlining its function body.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct IntWrapper {
  long i;
  MyClass operator+(const MyClass& rhs) const // Noncompliant
  {
    return MyClass{i + rhs.i}
  }
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct IntWrapper {
  long i;
  friend MyClass operator+(const MyClass& lhs, const MyClass& rhs) // Compliant
  {
    return Myclass{lhs.i + rhs.i}
  }
};
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct IntWrapper {
  long i;
};

MyClass operator+(const MyClass& lhs, const MyClass& rhs) // Noncompliant
{
  return Myclass{lhs.i + rhs.i}
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=4,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct IntWrapper {
  long i;
  friend MyClass operator+(const MyClass& lhs, const MyClass& rhs) // Compliant
  {
    return Myclass{lhs.i + rhs.i}
  }
};
----

=== How to handle operator with definition in source file

To define a hidden friend, the overloaded operator needs to be defined in class.
If the operator is initially defined in the source file, it may be necessary to move its definition to the header file.
In complex implementations, this may be undesired or impossible.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// Header file
class Integer {
public:
  Integer(long long int);
  Integer operator+(Integer const& rhs) const; // Noncompliant
};

// Source file
Integer Integer::operator+(Integer const& rhs) const
{
  /* Complex logic */
}
----

==== Compliant solution

To properly resolve such an issue, you may define a helper member function,
that will remain defined in the source file, and define the operator in terms of it.

For mathematical operators, this is usually achieved by defining them in terms of the corresponding compound assignment operator.
This has the additional benefit of reducing code duplication if both `operator+` and `operator+=` were already defined,
or making the interface more consistent by providing compound assignment counterparts for each supported operator.

[source,cpp,diff-id=5,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Header file
class Integer {
public:
  Integer(long long int);
  Integer& operator+=(Integer const& rhs);
  friend Integer operator+(Integer const& lhs, Integer const& rhs) // Compliant
  {
    Integer result = lhs;
    result += rhs;
    return result;
  }
};

// Source file
Integer& Integer::operator+=(Integer const& rhs)
{
  /* Complex logic */
}
----

=== How to handle operator template

When declaring a hidden friend for a class template, a separate friend function is instantiated for each instantiation of the enclosing class.
When changing from a free overloaded operator template to a friend function, template parameters corresponding to the class should be removed.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=6,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
template<typename CharT>
class StringRef {
public:
  StringRef(CharT const* str);

  int compare(StringRef other) const;
};

template<typename CharT>
bool operator==(StringRef<CharT> lhs, StringRef<CharT> rhs) // Noncompliant
{
  return lhs.compare(rhs) == 0;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=6,diff-type=compliant]
----
template<typename CharT>
class StringRef {
public:
  StringRef(CharT const* str);

  int compare(StringRef other) const;

  friend bool operator==(StringRef lhs, StringRef rhs) // Compliant: separate overload for each instantiation of StringRef<CharT>
  {
    return lhs.compare(rhs) == 0;
  }
};
----

Such a solution has the additional benefit of allowing the operands to be converted (as the operator is no longer a template).
This means that for `StringRef<char> sr`, the expression `sr == "Some string"` will compile and use the implicit constructor from ``++CharT const*++``,
alleviating the need to declare additional overloads accepting ``++const CharT*++``.

In the case of heterogeneous operators that accept different specializations, only one set of template parameters should be removed:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=7,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
template<typename T>
struct Optional {
  bool has_value() const;
  T const& value() const;
};

template<typename T>
  requires std::equality_comparable<T>
bool operator==(Optional<T> const& lhs, Optional<T> const& rhs) // Noncompliant
{
  if (lhs.has_value() && rhs.has_value()) {
    return lhs.value() == rhs.value();
  }
  return lhs.has_value() == rhs.has_value();
}

template<typename T, typename U>
  requires std::equality_comparable_with<T, U>
bool operator==(Optional<T> const& lhs, Optional<U> rhs) // Noncompliant
{
  if (lhs.has_value() && rhs.has_value()) {
    return lhs.value() == rhs.value();
  }
  return lhs.has_value() == rhs.has_value();
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=7,diff-type=compliant]
----
template<typename T>
struct Optional {
  bool has_value() const;
  T const& value() const;

  friend bool operator==(Optional const& lhs, Optional rhs) // Compliant: lhs and rhs are Optional<T>
    requires std::equality_comparable<T>
  {
    if (lhs.has_value() && rhs.has_value()) {
      return lhs.value() == rhs.value();
    }
    return lhs.has_value() == rhs.has_value();
  }

  template<typename U>
    requires std::equality_comparable_with<T, U>
  friend bool operator==(Optional const& lhs, Optional<U> rhs) // Compliant: lhs is Optional<T>
  {
    if (lhs.has_value() && rhs.has_value()) {
      return lhs.value() == rhs.value();
    }
    return lhs.has_value() == rhs.has_value();
  }
};

Exception for member `operator<<` and `operator>>` that looks like streaming is omitted on purpose.
I do not think any user will be confused about not having an issue there when they write a stream
(this happens only for members).
