== Why is this an issue?

Member functions can only be used with an instance of a class. But ``++friend++`` functions can be used with an implicitly converted type. So loosening access privileges to ``++friend++`` on overloaded binary operators makes them more flexible. Specifically, with a ``++friend++`` function, the class instance can be on either the right or the left of the operator, but with a member function, it can only be on the left.


This rule raises an issue for all non-``++friend++`` overloaded binary operators except:

* \"``++=++``", \"``++[ ]++``", and \"``++->++``", which cannot be overloaded as ``++friend++`` functions.
* \"``+++=++``", \"``++-=++``", \"``++*=++``", \"``++/=++``", \"``++%=++``", \"``++^=++``", \"``++&=++``", \"``++|=++``", \"``++<<=++``", and \"``++>>=++``", which are not symmetric operators.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
bool operator==(const MyClass &RHS);  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
friend bool operator==(const MyClass &LHS, const MyClass &RHS);
----
