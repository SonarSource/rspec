Authorizing anonymous access can reduce an organization's ability to protect itself against attacks on its Azure resources.

Security incidents may include disrupting critical functions, data theft, and additional Azure subscription costs due to resource overload.

Using authentication coupled with fine-grained authorizations helps bring Defense-In-Depth and bring traceability to investigators of security incidents.

Depending on the affected Azure resource, multiple authentication choices are possible: Active Directory Authentication, OpenID implementations (Google, Microsoft, etc.) or native Azure mechanisms.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* This Azure resource is essential for the information system infrastructure.
* This Azure resource is essential for mission-critical functions.
* This Azure resource stores or processes sensitive data.
* Compliance policies require access to this resource to be authenticated.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Enable authentication in this Azure resource, and disable anonymous access.

If only Basic Authentication is available, enable it.

== Sensitive Code Example

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/[App Services and equivalent]:

----
resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  name = "example"

  auth_settings {
    enabled = false # Sensitive
  }

  auth_settings {
    enabled = true
    unauthenticated_client_action = "AllowAnonymous" # Sensitive
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/[API Management]:

----
resource "azurerm_api_management_api" "example" { # Sensitive, the openid_authentication block is missing
  name = "example-api"
}

resource "azurerm_api_management" "example" {
  sign_in {
    enabled = false # Sensitive
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/[Data Factory] Linked Services:

----
resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_sftp" "example" {
  authentication_type = "Anonymous"
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/storage/[Storage Accounts]:

----
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  allow_blob_public_access = true # Sensitive
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" {
  container_access_type = "blob" # Sensitive
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/[Redis Caches]:

----
resource "azurerm_redis_cache" "example" {
  name = "example-cache"

  redis_configuration {
    enable_authentication = false # Sensitive
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/[App Services and equivalent]:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  name = "example"

  auth_settings {
    enabled = true
    unauthenticated_client_action = "RedirectToLoginPage"
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/[API Management]:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_api_management_api" "example" {
  name = "example-api"

  openid_authentication {
    openid_provider_name = azurerm_api_management_openid_connect_provider.example.name
  }
}

resource "azurerm_api_management" "example" {
  sign_in {
    enabled = true
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/[Data Factory] Linked Services:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_sftp" "example" {
  authentication_type = "Basic"
  username            = local.creds.username
  password            = local.creds.password
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_odata" "example" {
  basic_authentication {
    username = local.creds.username
    password = local.creds.password
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/storage/[Storage Accounts]:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  allow_blob_public_access = true
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" {
  container_access_type = "private"
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/[Redis Caches]:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_redis_cache" "example" {
  name = "example-cache"
 
  redis_configuration {

=== Message

* For App Service and equivalent resources:
** If ``auth_settings`` block is missing: Omitting ``auth_settings`` disables authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
** if ``auth_settings->enabled = false``: Make sure that disabling authentication is safe here.
** if ``auth_settings->unauthenticated_client_action = "AllowAnonymous"``: Make sure that authorizing anonymous access is safe here.
* For ``api_management_api``: Omitting ``openid_authentication`` disables authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
* For ``api_management`` resources:
** If ``sign_in`` block is missing: Omitting ``sign_in`` authorizes anonymous access. Make sure it is safe here.
** If ``sign_in->enabled = false``: Make sure that giving anonymous access without enforcing sign-in is safe here.
* For ``data_factory_linked_service_odata``: Omitting the ``basic_authentication`` block disables authentication. Make sure it is safe here.
* For ``data_factory_linked_service_sftp`` and ``data_factory_linked_service_web``: Make sure that authorizing anonymous access is safe here.
* For ``redis_cache``: Make sure that disabling authentication is safe here.
* For ``storage_account``: Make sure that authorizing potential anonymous access is safe here.
* For ``storage_container``: Make sure that authorizing potential anonymous access is safe here.

* For ``api_management``:
** Highlight the resource if the ``sign_in`` block is missing
** Highlight ``sign_in->enabled = false``
* For ``data_factory_linked_service_odata``: Highlight the resource if the ``basic_authentication`` block is missing
* For ``data_factory_linked_service_sftp`` and ``data_factory_linked_service_web``: Highlight ``authentication_type = "Anonymous"``
