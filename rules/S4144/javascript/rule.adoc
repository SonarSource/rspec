== Why is this an issue?

When two functions have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but may be confusing to maintainers. In the latter case, the code should be refactored.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function calculateCode() {
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}

function getName() {  // Noncompliant
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}
----

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
function calculateCode() {
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}

function getName() {
  return calculateCode();
}
----

=== Exceptions

* Functions with fewer than 3 lines are ignored.

* This rule does not apply to function expressions and arrow functions because they don't have explicit names and are often used in a way where refactoring is not applicable.

[source,javascript]
----
list.map((item) => ({
  name: item.name,
  address: item.address,
  country: item.country
}));
