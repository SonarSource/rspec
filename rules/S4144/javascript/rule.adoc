When two functions have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but may be confusing to maintainers. In the latter case, the code should be refactored.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function calculateCode() {
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}

function getName() {  // Noncompliant
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
function calculateCode() {
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}

function getName() {
  return calculateCode();
}
----

== Exceptions

Functions with fewer than 3 lines are ignored.
