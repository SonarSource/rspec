== Why is this an issue?

When two methods have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but may be confusing to maintainers. In the latter case, one implementation should invoke the other.

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
private const string CODE = "bounteous";
private int callCount = 0;

public string GetCode() 
{
  callCount++;
  return CODE;
}

public string GetName()  // Noncompliant
{
  callCount++;
  return CODE;
}
----

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
private const string CODE = "bounteous";
private int callCount = 0;

public string GetCode() 
{
  callCount++;
  return CODE;
}

public string GetName() 
{
  return GetCode();
}

=== Exceptions

Empty methods, methods with only one line of code and methods with the same name (overload) are ignored.
