== Why is this an issue?

When two methods have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but may be confusing to maintainers.

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Private Const CODE As String = "bounteous"
Private callCount As Integer = 0

Public Function GetCode() As String
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function

Public Function GetName() As String ' Noncompliant
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function
----

If the duplication is intentional, one implementation should invoke the other.

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Private Const CODE As String = "bounteous"
Private callCount As Integer = 0

Public Function GetCode() As String
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function

Public Function GetName() As String
  Return GetCode()
End Function
----

=== Exceptions

Empty methods, methods with only one line of code and methods with the same name (overload) are ignored.
