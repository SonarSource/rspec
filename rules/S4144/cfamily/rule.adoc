== Why is this an issue?

Two methods having the same implementation are suspicious.
 It might be that something else was intended. Or the duplication is intentional, which becomes a maintenance burden.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Circle : public Shape {
private:
  int ray;
public:
  void setWidth(int size) {
    ray = size / 2;
    updateShape();
  }

  void setHeight(int size) {  // Noncompliant: duplicates setWidth
    ray = size / 2;
    updateShape();
  }
};
----

If the identical logic is intentional, the code should be refactored to avoid duplication. For example, by having both methods call the same method or by having one implementation invoke the other.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Circle : public Shape {
private:
  int ray;
public:
  void setWidth(int size) {
    setDiameter(size);
  }

  void setHeight(int size) {
    setDiameter(size);
  }

private:
  void setDiameter(int size) { // Implementation is shared
    ray = size / 2;
    updateShape();
  }
};
----

This rule raises an issue on methods and not free functions.

=== Exceptions

Empty methods, methods with the same name (overload) and methods with only one statement are ignored.
