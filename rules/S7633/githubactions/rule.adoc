GitHub Actions automatically redacts secrets from logs to prevent accidental exposure. However, when structured data stored as secrets is parsed using functions like `fromJSON()`, the parsed values are no longer recognized as secrets by the automatic redaction mechanism. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed in workflow logs.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The structured data contains sensitive information that should not be exposed in logs.
* The parsed values from the structured data are used in contexts where they might be printed to logs.
* There are no additional safeguards in place to prevent the exposure of these parsed values.

There is a risk if you answer yes to all of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Avoid parsing structured data stored as secrets when the individual values need to remain secret.
* Store individual secrets separately instead of embedding them in structured data.
* If structured data must be used, ensure that any operations involving the parsed values are performed in environments where logging is controlled.
* Use intermediate variables with care and avoid echoing or printing variables that contain parsed secret values.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,yaml]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Example Step
        env:
          SECRET: ${{ fromJSON(secrets.JSON_SECRET).SECRET_IN_JSON }} # Sensitive
        run: |
          example-command "$SECRET"
----

== Compliant Solution

The example below is compliant because the secret is not parsed from structured data.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Example Step
        env:
          SECRET: ${{ secrets.SECRET }}
        run: |
          example-command "$SECRET"
