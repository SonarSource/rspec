My 2 cents [~ann.campbell.2]:

* For me this rule duplicates RSPEC-1181 in Java
* And catching an Exception in Java is not at all an issue. I would even say that this is a good practice at some levels when you want to be sure to catch all possible exceptions. this is only an issue if you catch Error or Throwable exception

I'm going to say it differently : as a Java developer I do believe that this rule is useless and even misleading. Indeed the best practice is the following one:

* Most of the time we should catch only specialized exceptions
* But as soon we are located at the boundary of a technical stack (SonarQube <-> Plugins, Web <-> EJB, ...), generic exceptions (but not Throwable and Error, see RSPEC-1181) should be caught.

So if we activate this rule on our own portfolio, we'll generate lot of false-positives.

\[~freddy.mallet] it sounds like you'd like to see this rule closed. Does the fact that it replaces a PMD rule change your mind?

Thanks [~sebastien.gioria]. 

I'm going to skip the CERT reference; it's about ``++throw++``-ing rather than ``++catch++``-ing. Also, I don't understand how this ties to OWASP A6.
