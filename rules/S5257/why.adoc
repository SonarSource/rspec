== Why is this an issue?

HTML <table> elements should not be used for layout purposes as it can confuse screen readers. It is recommended to use CSS instead.

This rule raises an issue on every ``++<table>++`` element containing a ``++role++`` attribute set to ``++"presentation"++`` or ``++"none"++``, which is how https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/[W3C recommends] marks layout tables.
