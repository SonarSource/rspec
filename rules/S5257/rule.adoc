HTML <table> elements should not be used for layout purpose as it can confuse screen readers. It is recommended to use CSS instead.

This rule raises an issue on every ``++<table>++`` element containing a ``++role++`` attribute set to ``++"presentation"++`` or ``++"none"++``, which is how https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/[W3C recommends] marks layout tables.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
<table role="presentation">
<!-- ... -->
</table>
----
