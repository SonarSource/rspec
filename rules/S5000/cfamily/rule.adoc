== Why is this an issue?

The function ``++memcmp++`` can only be used for objects of trivially copyable types. This includes scalar types, arrays, and trivially copyable classes. 


A class type is trivially copyable if:

* One or more of the following methods is trivial and the rest are deleted: copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator,
* It has a trivial, non-deleted destructor.

Additionally, if the type contains padding, some of its bits might be non-representative, and a strict comparison of raw memory contents might lead to the mistaken belief that two identical objects are actually different.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class Shape { // Trivially copyable, but will contain padding after the bool on most architectures
public:
  bool visible;
  int x;
  int y;
};

bool isSame(Shape *s1, Shape *s2)
{
    return memcmp(s1, s2, sizeof Shape) == 0; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class Shape {
public:
  bool visible;
  int x;
  int y;
};

bool operator==(Shape const &s1, Shape const &s2) {
  return s1.visible == s2.visible && s1.x == s2.x && s1.y == s2.y;
}

bool isSame(Shape *s1, Shape *s2)
{
    return (*s1) == (*s2);
}
