== Why is this an issue?

It is very easy to write incomplete assertions when using some test frameworks. This rule enforces complete assertions in the following cases:

* Fluent Assertions: https://fluentassertions.com/introduction[`Should()`] is not followed by an assertion invocation.
* NFluent: https://www.n-fluent.net[`Check.That()`] is not followed by an assertion invocation.
* NSubstitute: https://nsubstitute.github.io/help/received-calls[`Received()`] is not followed by an invocation.

In such cases, what is intended to be a test doesn't actually verify anything.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
string actual = "Hello World!";
// Fluent Assertions
actual.Should();     // Noncompliant
// NFluent
Check.That(actual);  // Noncompliant
// NSubstitute
command.Received();  // Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
string actual = "Hello World!";
// Fluent Assertions
actual.Should().Contain("Hello");
// NFluent
Check.That(actual).Contains("Hello");
// NSubstitute
command.Received().Execute();
----

Do we mark somehow rules that are library dependent? For example, out of the box we only have ``++Assert.IsTrue++`` and ``++Assert.AreEqual++``-like assertions. With those, this rule doesn't make sense. But when you add a library like "FluentAssertions", you could write "something.Should();" instead of "something.Should().NotBeNull()".

\[~tamas.vajk] should we expand the examples to include:

Assert;  // Noncompliant

----
Assert.AreNotSame(actual,"");

? Does the noncompliant version compile?
