=== What is the potential impact?

LaunchDarkly API access tokens are used to authenticate with the LaunchDarkly
REST API.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

// Set value that can be used to refer to the type of secret in, for example:
// "An attacker can use this {secret_type} to ..."
:secret_type: API token

// Where possible, use predefined content for common impacts. This content can
// be found in the folder "shared_content/secrets/impact".
// When using predefined content, search for any required variables to be set and include them in this file.
// Not adding them will not trigger warnings.
