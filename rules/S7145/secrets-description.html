<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>LaunchDarkly API access tokens are used to authenticate with the LaunchDarkly
REST API. It provides full access to all resources in the account, including
projects, environments, feature flags, and user data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application&#8217;s
users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_source_code">Compromise of sensitive source code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The affected service is used to store private packages and repositories. If a token is leaked, it can be used by unauthorized individuals to gain access to your sensitive code, proprietary libraries, and other confidential resources. This can lead to intellectual property theft, unauthorized modifications, or even sabotage of your software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these private packages contain other secrets, it might even lead to further breaches in the organization&#8217;s services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_infrastructure_takeover">Infrastructure takeover</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By obtaining a leaked secret, an attacker can gain control over your organization&#8217;s {service_name} infrastructure. They can modify DNS settings, redirect traffic, or launch malicious instances that can be used for various nefarious activities, including launching DDoS attacks, hosting phishing websites, or distributing malware. Malicious instances may also be used for resource-intensive tasks such as cryptocurrency mining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can result in legal liability, but also increased costs, degraded performance, and potential service disruptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, corporate {service_name} infrastructures are often connected to other services and to the internal networks of the organization. Because of this, cloud infrastructure is often used by attackers as a gateway to other assets. Attackers can leverage this gateway to gain access to more services, to compromise more business-critical data and to cause more damage to the overall infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
