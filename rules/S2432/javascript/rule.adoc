== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, a setter is a special type of function that is used to set the value of a property on an object. Setters are defined using the ``++set++`` keyword followed by the name of the property that the setter is associated with.

To set the property, we simply assign a value to it as if it were a regular property. The setter function is automatically called with the value that we assign to the property.

Functions declared with the ``++set++`` keyword will automatically return the values they were passed. Thus any value explicitly returned from a setter will be ignored, and explicitly returning a value is a mistake.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let person = {
  // ...
  set firstname(first) {
    this.first = first;
    return 42;  // Noncompliant: The return value 42 will be ignored
  }
};
console.log(person.firstname = 'bob'); // Prints 'bob'
----

Since return values in setters are ignored, you should remove return statements altogether.
