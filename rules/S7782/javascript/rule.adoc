This rule raises an issue when using regular expressions with `^` (start anchor) or `$` (end anchor) patterns to test simple string prefixes or suffixes.

== Why is this an issue?

Using regular expressions for simple string prefix and suffix checks makes code less readable and harder to understand. When you see `/^foo/.test(string)`, it requires mental parsing to understand that you're checking if the string starts with "foo".

The `String#startsWith()` and `String#endsWith()` methods were specifically designed for these common operations. They express the intent more clearly and are typically more performant than regular expressions for simple string matching.

Regular expressions are powerful tools, but they add unnecessary complexity when simpler, more semantic alternatives exist. Using the appropriate string methods makes your code more maintainable and easier for other developers to understand at a glance.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using regular expressions instead of string methods reduces code readability and maintainability. Other developers need to spend extra time understanding the regex pattern when the intent could be expressed more clearly with dedicated string methods.

=== How to fix?


Replace regex patterns that check string prefixes with the `startsWith()` method. This makes the code intention clear and improves readability.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const isValid = /^https/.test(url); // Noncompliant

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const isValid = url.startsWith('https');
