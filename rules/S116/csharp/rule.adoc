== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

Using the regular expression ``++^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$ ++``, the noncompliant code below:

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass {
   private int my_field;
}
----

Should be replaced with:

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass {
   private int myField;
}
----

== Exceptions

Loops with side effects in their condition or incrementor expressions are excluded from this rule. These loops are intentionally empty because the work is performed in the loop's condition or incrementor.

Examples of side effects that exclude a loop from this rule:

* Increment/decrement operators: `while (++counter < 10);`
* Assignment operators: `while ((value = ReadNext()) != null);`
* Compound assignment operators: `while ((sum += value) < 100);`
* Method calls that may have side effects: `while (reader.Read() != -1);`
* Await expressions: `while (await task != null);`

For loops with side effects in their incrementors are also excluded:

[source,csharp]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ProcessItem(i));
----
