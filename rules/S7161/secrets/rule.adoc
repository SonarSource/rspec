=== What is the potential impact?

Tableau secrets scopes depend on the type of secret. From the most impactful to
the least:

1. Account passwords
2. Personal access tokens (PAT)
3. "Credentials token", received after a SignIn request

Their scopes vary in terms of lifetime, access, and privileges.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
