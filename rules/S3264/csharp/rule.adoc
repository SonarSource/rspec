Events that are not invoked anywhere are dead code, and there's no good reason to keep them in the source.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class UninvokedEventSample
{
    private event Action<object, EventArgs> Happened; //Noncompliant

    public void RegisterEventHandler(Action<object, EventArgs> handler)
    {
        Happened += handler; //we register some event handlers
    }

    public void RaiseEvent()
    {
        if (Happened != null)
        {
            // Happened(this, null); // the event is never triggered, because this line is commented out.
        }
    }
}
