== Why is this an issue?

``++std::scoped_lock++`` basically provides the same feature as ``++std::lock_guard++``, but is more generic: It can lock several mutexes at the same time, with a deadlock prevention mechanism (see S5524). The equivalent code to perform simultaneous locking with ``++std::lock_guard++`` is significantly more complex. Therefore, it is simpler to use ``++std::scoped_lock++`` all the time, even when locking only one mutex (there will be no performance impact).


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void f1(std::mutex &m1) {
  std::lock_guard lock{m1}; // Noncompliant
  // Do some work
}

void f2(std::mutex &m1, std::mutex &m2)
    std::lock(m1, m2);
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock1{m1, std::adopt_lock}; // Noncompliant
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock2{m2, std::adopt_lock}; // Noncompliant
    // Do some work
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void f1(std::mutex &m1) {
  std::scoped_lock lock{m1}; // Compliant
  // Do some work
}

void f2(std::mutex &m1, std::mutex &m2)
    std::scoped_lock lock{m1, m2}; // Compliant, and more simple
    // Do some work
}
