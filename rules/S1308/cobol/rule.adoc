== Why is this an issue?

Unstructured programming has been strongly criticized for producing barely readable (spaghetti) code. It offers programmers great freedom, but is considered a bad approach for creating major projects.


In COBOL, the use of ``++GO TO++`` statements can lead to unstructured control flows. Eliminating ``++GO TO++`` statements in favor of ``++PERFORM++`` statements will aid adherence to a procedural programming approach. However, this change could require heavy refactoring.
