== Why is this an issue?

Introduced in {cpp}11, ``++static_assert++`` checks a precondition at compile-time and emits a diagnostic error message.

For any condition that could be checked at compile-time, `static_assert` should be preferred to the C macro `assert`:

* Because it is checked at compile-time, the maintainer changing the code is immediately warned when the condition breaks, as opposed to `assert` which will trigger only when the specific line is run, potentially by another person.

* Because it is checked at compile-time, it is impossible to accidentally create a side-effect.

* It cannot have a runtime performance cost.

* Contrary to `assert`, it is not a macro and thus doesn't have the same surprising behaviors like bad handling of commas or confusing error messages when it doesn't compile.

* It is designed to emit a customizable error message which will be useful to diagnose the error.

template <class T>
void testFunction(T t) {
  static_assert(sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long), "long long is smaller than long!");
  static_assert(std::is_integral_v<T>, "This template only works for integral types");
  assert(t > 0); // Compliant: only known at runtime
  // ...
}

This rule doesn't trigger for assertions that are false on purpose to stop the execution flow:

[source,cpp]
----
[[noreturn]] void stop() {
  assert(false); // Compliant: Interrupting the runtime execution
  assert(!"We shouldn't reach this"); // Compliant: Interrupting the runtime execution
}
