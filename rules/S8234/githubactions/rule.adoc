== Why is this an issue?

Using `permissions: read-all` or `permissions: write-all` grants all read or write permissions to a job, violating the principle of least privilege. Jobs should only have the specific permissions they need.

* `read-all` grants: pull-requests: read, packages: read, deployments: read, actions: read, etc.

* `write-all` grants: pull-requests: write, packages: write, deployments: write, actions: write, etc.

For example, a job that only needs to read issues should not have access to read code, pull requests, or packages. A job that only needs to write files should not be able to create releases, modify deployments, or write to other repositories.

=== What is the potential impact?

If a workflow or job is compromised (e.g., via malicious code injection, supply chain attack, or accidental exposure), excessive permissions can lead to:

==== Data Exposure

If a workflow or job with `read-all` permission is compromised, an attacker can access sensitive data in issues, pull requests, or packages etc.

==== Unauthorized Modification

If a workflow or job with `write-all` permission is compromised, an attacker can create or modify issues, pull requests, releases, or deployments etc.

==== Supply chain compromise

If a workflow or job with `write-all` permission is compromised, an attacker can publish malicious packages or modify artifacts

== How to fix it

Replace `read-all` and `write-all` with specific permissions that match the job's actual needs. If a job needs multiple permissions, list them explicitly:
----
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read
  issues: write
----
=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
name: Example
jobs:
  test-job:
    permissions: read-all # Noncompliant
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Do something that requires 'contents: read' permissions.
----
[source,yaml,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
name: Example
permissions: write-all # Noncompliant
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: hello
         # Do something that requires 'contents: write' permissions.
----
==== Compliant solution
[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
name: Example
jobs:
  test-job:
    permissions:
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Do something that requires 'contents: read' permissions.
----
[source,yaml,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
name: Example
jobs:
  example:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: hello
         # Do something that requires 'contents: write' permissions.

=== How does this work?

GitHub Actions enforces permissions through the GITHUB_TOKEN automatically provided to each workflow run. When you specify permissions in a workflow, GitHub restricts the token's scopes for that job.

When a job uses `permissions: read-all`, GitHub grants all read permissions to the GITHUB_TOKEN for that job. Similarly, `permissions: write-all` grants all write permissions. This means any step in the job can perform any read or write operation, even if it's not needed.

By specifying individual permissions like permissions: `contents: read`, GitHub restricts the token to only that scope. If a step tries to access other resources (e.g., reading issues with only contents: read), GitHub returns 403 Forbidden, preventing unauthorized access.
