== Why is this an issue?

By convention, a Java class' physical location (source directories) and its logical representation (packages) should be kept in sync. Thus a Java file located at ``++"src/org/bar/Foo.java"++`` should have a package of ``++"org.bar"++``. 


Unfortunately, this convention is not enforced by Java compilers, and nothing prevents a developer from making the "Foo.java" class part of the "com.apple" package, which could degrade the maintainability of both the class and its application.


Similarly, source placed in a folder with dots in its name instead of having the equivalent folder structure will compile but cause problems at run time. For instance, code with a package declaration of ``++org.foo.bar++`` that is placed in ``++org/foo.bar++`` will compile, but the classloader will always search for the class into the folder based on package structure, and will consequently expect sources to be in ``++org/foo/bar++`` folder. ``++foo.bar++`` is therefore not a proper folder name for sources.
