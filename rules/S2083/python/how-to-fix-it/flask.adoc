=== How to fix it in Flask

The following code is vulnerable to path injection as it is constructing a path
using untrusted data. +
This path is then used without validation to return a file.

Therefore, it can be leveraged by an attacker to delete arbitrary files.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory

app = Flask('example')

@app.route('/example')
def example():
    my_file = request.args['my_file']
    return send_file("static/%s" % my_file, as_attachment=True) # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory

app = Flask('example')

@app.route('/example')
def example():
    my_file = request.args['my_file']
    return send_from_directory('static', my_file)
----

=== How does this work?

:auto_canonicalization_function: send_from_directory

The universal method to prevent path injection is to validate paths created
from untrusted data. This can be done either manually or automatically,
depending on whether the library includes a data sanitization feature and the
required function.

Here, {auto_canonicalization_function} can be considered a secure-by-design API.
