=== What is the potential impact?

A successful attack might give an attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete sensitive information from the file system and sometimes even execute arbitrary operating system commands.

The files that can be affected are limited by the permission of the process that runs the application. Worst case scenario: the process runs with root privileges on Linux, and therefore any file can be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various effects of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.
