Path injections occur when an application uses untrusted data to construct a file path and access this file without validating its path first.

A user with malicious intent would inject specially crafted values, such as ``++../++``, to change the initial intended path. The resulting path would resolve somewhere in the filesystem where the user should not normally have access to.
