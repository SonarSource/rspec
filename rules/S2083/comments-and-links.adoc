I have some doubt about that one as for instance in Java plugin code base I have the following:

----
private File resolvePath(File baseDir, String fileName) {
    File file = new File(fileName);
    if (!file.isAbsolute()) {
      file = new File(baseDir, fileName);
    }
    return file;
  }

Which is based on a property coming from SQ and filled by the user to be able to access libraries of a java project. So you actually _want_ to support access to some files eventually located in relative directories...

\[~nicolas.peru] there are 2 CWE's we're covering here, one about absolute path traversal and another about relative traversal.


In any case, the point of your code is to read files on paths provided by the user. Since your code runs on the user's machine, there's no problem with that and I wouldn't expect this rule to be activated. I'll switch this to off by default.
