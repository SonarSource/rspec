=== How to fix it in Core PHP

:canonicalization_function: `realPath`
The following code is vulnerable to path injection as it is constructing a path
using untrusted data. +
This path is then used without validation to return a file.

Therefore, it can be leveraged by an attacker to read arbitrary files.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
$fileName = $_GET["filename"];

file_get_contents($fileName); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
$fileName = $_GET["filename"];
$targetDirectory = "/path/to/target/directory/";

$path = realpath($targetDirectory . $fileName);

if (str_starts_with($path,  $targetDirectory)) {
    file_get_contents($path);
}
----
