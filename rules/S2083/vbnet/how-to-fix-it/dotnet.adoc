==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Private Shared TargetDirectory As String = "/path/to/target/directory/"

    Public Sub Example(FileName As String)
        Dim Path As String = IO.Path.Combine(TargetDirectory, FileName)
        IO.File.Delete(Path)
    End Sub
End Class

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Private Shared TargetDirectory As String = "/path/to/target/directory/"

    Public Sub Example(FileName As String)
        Dim Path As String = IO.Path.Combine(TargetDirectory, FileName)
        Dim CanonicalDestinationPath As String = IO.Path.GetFullPath(Path)

        If CanonicalDestinationPath.StartsWith(TargetDirectory, StringComparison.Ordinal) Then
            IO.File.Delete(CanonicalDestinationPath)
        End If
    End Sub
End Class

=== How does this work?

:canonicalization_function: System.IO.Path.GetFullPath

include::../../common/fix/self-validation.adoc[]

=== Pitfalls

include::../../common/pitfalls/partial-path-traversal.adoc[]

For example, the following code is vulnerable to partial path injection. Note
that the string `TargetDirectory` does not end with a path separator:


[source, vbnet]
----
Private Shared TargetDirectory As String = "/Users/John/"

Public Sub Example(FileName As String)
    Dim CanonicalDestinationPath As String = IO.Path.GetFullPath(FileName)

    If CanonicalDestinationPath.StartsWith(TargetDirectory, StringComparison.Ordinal) Then
        IO.File.Delete(CanonicalDestinationPath)
    End If
End Sub
----

This check can be bypassed because `"/Users/Johnny/file".startsWith("/Users/John")`
returns `true`. Thus, for validation, `"/Users/John"` should actually be
`"/Users/John/"`.

**Warning**: Some functions remove the terminating path separator in their
return value. +
The validation code should be tested to ensure that it cannot be impacted by this
issue.
