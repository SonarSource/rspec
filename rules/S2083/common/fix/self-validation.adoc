==== Validate data yourself

The validation should be done as follow:

1. Resolve the canonical path of the file by using methods like `{canonicalization_function}`. This will resolve relative path or path components like `../` and removes any ambiguity regarding the file's location. 
2. Check that the canonical path is within the directory where the file should be located.
3. Ensure the target directory path ends with a forward slash to prevent partial path traversal, for example, */base/dirmalicious* starts with */base/dir* but does not start with */base/dir/*.
