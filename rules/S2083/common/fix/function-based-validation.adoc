==== Use functions that combine feature and validation

The cleanest way to fix this vulnerability is to use a function that combines:

* the retrieval of a file
* restrict the retrieval of a file to a specific folder


Built-in APIs from libraries like `{auto_canonicalization_function}` benefit from
quality maintenance regarding features, security, or hardening. It is usually
better to use these solutions than to develop your own.

Behind the scenes, this function protects against both regular and partial path
injection.
