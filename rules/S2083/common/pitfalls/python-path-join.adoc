==== os.path.join(path, \*paths)

This function should not be used as a validator.

The standard library states: *"if a component is an absolute path, all previous
components are discarded, and linking continues from the component with the
absolute path."*

This means that including untrusted data in any of the path parameters can lead
to a full or partial path traversal vulnerability.
