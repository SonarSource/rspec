==== Do not use {joining_func} as a validator

The {joining_docs}[official documentation] states that if any argument other
than the first is an absolute path, any previous argument is discarded.

This means that including untrusted data in any of the parameters and using the
resulting string for file operations may lead to a path traversal vulnerability.
