==== Do not use {joining_func} as a validator

As the {joining_docs}[official documentation] states, if an argument other
than the first is an absolute path, any previous argument is discarded.

This means that including untrusted data in any of the parameter and using the
resulting string for file operations may lead to a full or partial path
traversal vulnerability.
