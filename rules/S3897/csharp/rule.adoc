The ``++IEquatable<T>++`` interface has only one method in it: ``++Equals(<T>)++``. If you've already written ``++Equals(T)++``, there's no reason not to explicitly implement ``++IEquatable<T>++``. Doing so expands the utility of your class by allowing it to be used where an ``++IEquatable++`` is called for.


**Note**: Classes that implement ``++IEquatable<T>++`` should also be ``++sealed++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyClass  // Noncompliant
{
  public bool Equals(MyClass other)
  {
    //...
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
sealed class MyClass : IEquatable<MyClass>
{
  public override bool Equals(object other)
  {
    return Equals(other as MyClass);
  }

  public bool Equals(MyClass other) 
  {
    //...
  }
}
