== Why is this an issue?

An `IDisposable` object should be disposed (there are some rare exceptions where not disposing is fine, most notably `Task`). If a class has an `IDisposable` field, there can be two situations:

* The class observes a field that is under the responsibility of another class. 
* The class owns the field, and is therefore responsible for calling `Dispose` on it.

In the second case, the safest way for the class to ensure `Dispose` is called is to call it in its own `Dispose` function, and therefore to be itself `IDisposable`. A class is considered to own an `IDisposable` field resource if it created the object referenced by the field.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class ResourceHolder   // Noncompliant; doesn't implement IDisposable
{
    private FileStream fs;  // This member is never Disposed
    public void OpenResource(string path)
    {
        this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open); // I create the FileStream, I'm owning it
    }
    public void CloseResource()
    {
        this.fs.Close();
    }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable 
{
    private FileStream fs; 
    public void OpenResource(string path) 
    { 
        this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open); // I create the FileStream, I'm owning it
    } 
    public void CloseResource() 
    { 
        this.fs.Close(); 
    }
    public void Dispose() 
    { 
        this.fs.Dispose(); 
    } 
}
