== Why is this an issue?

Indexes allow for faster retrieval of data than might otherwise be possible, but they come at a cost in both processor and memory use. When an index is used, the speed increase it contributes to data retrieval makes it well worth the cost. But an unused index is simply a waste of resources. Therefore unused indexes should be removed.
