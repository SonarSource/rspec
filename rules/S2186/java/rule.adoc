JUnit assertions should not be made from the ``++run++`` method of a ``++Runnable++``, because failed assertions result in ``++AssertionError++``s being thrown. If the error is thrown from a thread other than the one that ran the test, the thread will exit but the test won't fail.

  // ...
  Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);  // Noncompliant
}
