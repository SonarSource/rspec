Since Java 7 it has been possible to catch multiple exceptions at once. Therefore, when multiple ``++catch++`` blocks have the same code, they should be combined for better readability.


*Note* that this rule is automatically disabled when the project's ``++sonar.java.source++`` is lower than ``++7++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
catch (IOException e) {
  doCleanup();
  logger.log(e);
}
catch (SQLException e) {  // Noncompliant
  doCleanup();
  logger.log(e);
}
catch (TimeoutException e) {  // Compliant; block contents are different
  doCleanup();
  throw e;
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
catch (IOException|SQLException e) {
  doCleanup();
  logger.log(e);
}
catch (TimeoutException e) {
  doCleanup();
  throw e;
}
----
