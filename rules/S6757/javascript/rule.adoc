== Why is this an issue?

Referring to `this` in React functional components would be an error because the components are just regular JavaScript functions 
and do not have an object associated with them. Functional components receive their props as a first argument to the component function,
so you can access them directly, and it is a common practice to destructure them right away.

[source,javascript]
----
function UserProfile({firstName, lastName}){
    return (
        <div className="user">{firstName} {lastName}</div>
    );
}
----

React also supports legacy class-based components, where `this` keyword refers to the component instance object, but this style of writing components is no longer recommended, and mixing it with functional components will lead to errors.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function MyComponent(props){
    const foo = this.props.bar; // Noncompliant: remove 'this'
    return (
        <div>{foo}</div>
    );
}
----

To fix the issue, remove references to `this` from your functional component code. Make also sure you are not mixing functional and class-based component styles.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
function MyComponent({bar}){
    const foo = bar;
    return (
        <div>{foo}</div>
    );
}
----
