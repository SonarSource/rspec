== Why is this an issue?

Referring to `this` in React functional components would be an error because the components are just regular JavaScript functions 
and do not have an object assotiated with them. The functional components receive its props as a first argument to the component function,
so you can access then directly, and it is a common style to destructure them right away.

[source,javascript]
----
function UserProfile({firstName, lastName}){
    return (
        <div className="user">{firstName} {lastName}</div>
    );
}
----

React also supports legacy class-based components, where `this` keyword refers to the component instance object, but this style of writing components is no longer recommended, and mixing it with functional components will lead to errors.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function MyComponent(props){
    const foo = this.props.bar; // Noncompliant: remove 'this'
    return (
        <div>{foo}</div>
    );
}
----

To fix the issue remove `this` from your functional component code (are you mixing functional and class-based component styles?)

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
function MyComponent(props){
    const foo = props.bar;
    return (
        <div>{foo}</div>
    );
}
----
