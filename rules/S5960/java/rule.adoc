Assertions are intended to be used in *test* code, but not in *production* code. It is confusing, and might lead to ``++ClassNotFoundException++`` when the build tools only provide the required dependency in test scope.

In addition, assertions will throw a sub-class of ``++Error++``: ``++AssertionError++``, which should be avoided in production code.


This rule raises an issue when any assertion intended to be used in test is used in production code.


Supported frameworks:

* JUnit
* FestAssert
* AssertJ

Note: this does not apply for ``++assert++`` from Java itself or if the source code package name is related to tests (contains: ``++test++`` or ``++assert++`` or ``++junit++``).
