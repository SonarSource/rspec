\[~tamas.vajk], I know you said we probably didn't need a code example, but I really felt like we needed to illustrate what we were looking for. 


My code sample is probably wrong. Would you clean it up, please?

We could also have a similar rule for class and file name mappings. Or we could just add it to this rule. Class names should match their containing file name.

\[~tamas.vajk] what about the fact that I can have multiple top-level classes in a file?

\[~ann.campbell.2] You can, but you shouldn't. We could check if any of the top-level classes' names match the file name. Also, there is a problem with ``++partial++`` classes. They might be defined in multiple files in the same folder. So we can't force the file name to be identical. In this case usually we have a file name in the following format: _CLASSNAME.SOMEOTHERNAME.cs_, for example: _MyForm.Designer.cs_

Thanks [~tamas.vajk]. I created a new rule (which is assigned to you).


Note that I've also pulled this phrase from the Noncompliant example section: Given a project default namespace of "MyProject"

Since there was no reference to "MyProject" in the code itself.
