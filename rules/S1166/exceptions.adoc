=== Exceptions

``++InterruptedException++``, ``++NumberFormatException++``, ``++DateTimeParseException++``, ``++ParseException++`` and ``++MalformedURLException++`` exceptions are arguably used to indicate nonexceptional outcomes. Similarly, handling ``++NoSuchMethodException++`` is often required when dealing with the Java reflection API.

Because they are part of Java, developers have no choice but to deal with them. This rule does not verify that those particular exceptions are correctly handled.


----
int myInteger;
try {
  myInteger = Integer.parseInt(myString);
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
  // It is perfectly acceptable to not handle "e" here
  myInteger = 0;
}
----

Furthermore, no issue will be raised if the exception message is logged with additional information, as it shows that the developer added some context to the error message.


----
try {
  /* ... */
} catch (Exception e) {
  String message = "Exception raised while authenticating user: " + e.getMessage();
  LOGGER.warn(message); // Compliant - exception message logged with some contextual information
}
----
