This rule raises an issue when an object, class, or module defines a property or method named `then`.

== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript treats objects with a `then` property as "thenable" - similar to Promises. This can cause unexpected behavior when these objects are used with `await` expressions or dynamic imports.

When JavaScript encounters an object with a `then` property in an `await` expression, it assumes the object is Promise-like and tries to resolve it. This can lead to:

* Code execution being suspended indefinitely if the `then` method doesn't behave like a Promise
* Unexpected errors if the `then` method throws an exception
* Silent failures where subsequent code never executes

The same issue occurs with dynamic imports. If a module exports a `then` function, the import statement will treat the entire module as thenable, potentially calling the `then` function instead of returning the module object.

This behavior stems from JavaScript's Promise resolution algorithm, which checks for a `then` property to determine if an object should be treated as a Promise.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue can cause applications to hang indefinitely, throw unexpected errors, or fail silently. In production environments, this could lead to unresponsive user interfaces, incomplete data processing, or application crashes. The debugging experience is particularly poor because the connection between the `then` property and the problematic behavior is not immediately obvious.

=== How to fix?


Rename the `then` property to a more descriptive name that reflects its actual purpose.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const userAction = {
  userId: 123,
  then() { // Noncompliant
    console.log('Action completed');
  }
};
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const userAction = {
  userId: 123,
  complete() {
    console.log('Action completed');
  }
};
