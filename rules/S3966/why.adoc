== Why is this an issue?

Disposing an object twice in the same method, either with the {using} or by calling `Dispose` directly, is confusing and error-prone. For example, another developer might try to use an already-disposed object, or there can be runtime errors for specific paths in the code.

In addition, even if the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable.dispose#System_IDisposable_Dispose[documentation] explicitly states that calling the `Dispose` method multiple times should not throw an exception, some implementations still do it. Thus it is safer to not dispose of an object twice when possible.
