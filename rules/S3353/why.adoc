== Why is this an issue?

If a variable that is not supposed to change is not marked as `const`, it could be accidentally reassigned elsewhere in the code, leading to unexpected behavior and bugs that can be hard to track down.

By declaring a variable as `const`, you ensure that its value remains constant throughout the code. It also signals to other developers that this value is intended to remain constant. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

In some cases, using `const` can lead to performance improvements. The compiler might be able to make optimizations knowing that the value of a `const` variable will not change.
