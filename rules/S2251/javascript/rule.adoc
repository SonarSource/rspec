== Why is this an issue?

A ``++for++`` loop with a stop condition that can never be reached, such as one with a counter that moves in the wrong direction, will run infinitely. While there are occasions when an infinite loop is intended, the convention is to construct such loops as ``++while++`` loops. More typically, an infinite ``++for++`` loop is a bug. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; i < strings.length; i--) { // Noncompliant;
  //...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
  //...
}
