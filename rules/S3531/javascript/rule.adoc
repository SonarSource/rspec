== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, a generator is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed during its execution. It allows you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a function that can maintain its internal state and produce a sequence of values over time.

Generators are defined using a function syntax with an asterisk ``++(*)++`` appended to the ``++function++`` keyword (``++function*++``). Within the generator function, you can use the ``++yield++`` keyword to produce a value and temporarily pause the execution of the function, returning that value to the consumer.

[source,javascript]
----
function* generate() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}
----

This example defines a generator function named ``++generate++`` that produces a sequence of values: 1, 2, and 3.

Using a generator without the ``++yield++`` keyword can limit the usefulness and potential benefits of generators. When you use the ``++yield++`` keyword without providing a value, it creates a yield expression that pauses the execution of the generator function and returns ``++undefined++`` as the yielded value.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function* range(start, end) {
  while (start < end) {
    yield; // Noncompliant: The generator yields undefined
    start++;
  }
}
----

Yielding without a value makes it harder for the generator consumer to understand the purpose or context of the yielded value. Instead, one should always provide an explicit value with ``++yield++`` (using `undefined` when that is the intention) to make the generated sequence more meaningful and informative.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
function* range(start, end) {
  while (start < end) {
    yield start;
    start++;
  }
}
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] Could you add to description smth like "It even could be a bug in your problem as you your iterator produced by this generator function is always empty"?

And I would like to remove highlighting and specific message for return, I don't think it's worth that. Are you ok?
