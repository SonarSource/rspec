== Why is this an issue?

Both ``++arguments.caller++`` and ``++arguments.callee++`` make quite a few optimizations impossible so they were deprecated in latest versions of JavaScript. In fact, EcmaScript 5 forbids the use of both in ``++strict++`` mode, according to the docs:

____
Arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable accessor properties named "caller" and "callee" which throw a TypeError exception on access.
____


The same restriction applies to the function's ``++caller++`` and ``++arguments++`` properties in ``++strict++`` mode.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function whoCalled() {
   if (arguments.caller == null)   //Noncompliant
      console.log('I was called from the global scope.');
   else
      console.log(arguments.caller + ' called me!');  // Noncompliant

  console.log(whoCalled.caller);  // Noncompliant
  console.log(whoCalled.arguments);  // Noncompliant
}
