== Why is this an issue?

In order to produce a formatted string, both `string.Create` and either `FormattableString.Invariant` or `FormattableString.CurrentCulture` can be used. However, `string.Create` rents array buffers from `ArrayPool<char>` making it more performant, as well as preventing unnecessary allocations and future stress on the Garbage Collector. 

This applies to .NET versions after .NET 6, when these `string.Create` overloads were introduced.
