== Why is this an issue?

Most built-in bitwise operators (``++~++``, ``++>>++``, ``++>>=++``, ``++&++``, ``++&=++``, ``++^++``, ``++^=++``, ``++|++``, and ``++|=++``) have implementation-dependent results when performed on signed operands, and bitwise left shift (``++<<++`` and ``++<<=++``) has unspecified or undefined behavior when performed on negative operands.

Therefore, bitwise operations should not be performed on signed operands.

Starting with {cpp}20, the behaviors have been defined more accurately (negative values have to be represented using two's complement), and therefore this rule will only report an issue when the second operand of a shift operator is signed (shifting by a negative value is still undefined behavior).

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
if ( ( uint16_a & int16_b ) == 0x1234U ) // Noncompliant until C++20
if ( ~int16_a == 0x1234U ) // Noncompliant until C++20

auto f(int i) {
    return 1 << i; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
if ( ( uint16_a | uint16_b ) == 0x1234U )
if ( ~uint16_a == 0x1234U )

auto f(unsigned int i) {
    return 1 << i;
}
----


=== Exceptions

When used as bit flags, it is acceptable to use preprocessor macros as arguments to the & and | operators even if the value is not explicitly declared as unsigned.

[source,cpp]
----
fd = open(file_name, UO_WRONLY | UO_CREAT | UO_EXCL | UO_TRUNC, 0600);
----

If the right-side operand to a shift operator is known at compile time, it is acceptable for the value to be represented with a signed type provided it is positive.

[source,cpp]
----
#define SHIFT 24
foo = 15u >> SHIFT;
----

When combining several bitwise operations, even if all leaf operands are unsigned, if they are smaller than an `int`, some intermediate results will be of type `signed int`, due to integral promotion. However, this situation is usually not an issue, and is an exception for this rule:

[source,cpp]
----
unsigned int f(unsigned short src) {
  return (src >> 3) & 0x1F; // (src >> 3) is of type signed int
}
----
