Most built-in bitwise operators (``++~++``, ``++>>++``, ``++>>=++``, ``++&++``, ``++&=++``, ``++^++``, ``++^=++``, ``++|++``, and ``++|=++``) have implementation-dependent results when performed on signed operands, and bitwise left shift (``++<<++`` and ``++<<=++``) has undefined behavior when performed on negative operands. Therefore bitwise operations should not be performed on signed operands.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if ( ( uint16_a & int16_b ) == 0x1234U ) 
if ( ~int16_a == 0x1234U ) 
----


== Compliant Solution

----
if ( ( uint16_a | uint16_b ) == 0x1234U ) 
if ( ~uint16_a == 0x1234U )
----


== Exceptions

When used as bit flags, it is acceptable to use preprocessor macros as arguments to the & and | operators even if the value is not explicitly declared as unsigned.

----
fd = open(file_name, UO_WRONLY | UO_CREAT | UO_EXCL | UO_TRUNC, 0600);
----

If the right-side operand to a shift operator is known at compile time, it is acceptable for the value to be represented with a signed type provided it is positive.

----
#define SHIFT 24
foo = 15u >> SHIFT;
----
