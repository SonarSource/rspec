== Why is this an issue?

Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in (possibly nested) objects and arrays. It can make code more concise and expressive by directly extracting values or properties needed from arrays or objects. However, it is possible to define an empty pattern that has no effect, where no variables are bound to the destructured values.


[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
var {a: {}} = myObj; // Noncompliant: this does not create any variable
function foo({first: []}) { // Noncompliant: this does not define any parameter
  // ...
}
----

When empty curly braces or brackets are used to the right of a property name, the intent is to use a default value. To fix it, use the assignment operator (`=`).

If that is not the intention, fix the left-side pattern to contain the variables to create.
