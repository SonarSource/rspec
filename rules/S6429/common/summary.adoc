Exposing Docker sockets can lead to compromise of the host systems.

The Docker daemon provides an API to access its functionality, for example through a UNIX domain socket.
Mounting the Docker socket into a container allows the container to control the Docker daemon of the host system, resulting in full access over the whole system.
A compromised or rogue container with access to the Docker socket could endanger the integrity of the whole Kubernetes cluster.

== Ask Yourself Whether

There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to never add a Docker socket as a volume to a Pod.
