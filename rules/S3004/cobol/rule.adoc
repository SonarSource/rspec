== Why is this an issue?

A primary key uniquely identifies a row in a database table, and should be considered immutable. Primary key values may be used in foreign keys in other tables, as well as in external systems. Changing such a value, even with the best of motivations, is likely to wreak havoc on the system's data integrity and potentially across other systems as well.


*Note* That this rule raises issues only when a database catalog is provided during the SonarQube analysis.
