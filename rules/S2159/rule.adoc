== Why is this an issue?

Comparisons of dissimilar types will always return false. The comparison and all its dependent code can simply be removed. This includes:

* comparing an object with null
* comparing an object with an unrelated primitive (E.G. a string with an int)
* comparing unrelated classes
* comparing an unrelated ``++class++`` and ``++interface++``
* comparing unrelated ``++interface++`` types
