== How to fix it

The simplest and most recommended way is to replace the non-interactive elements with interactive ones. If for some reason you can't replace the non-interactive element, you can add an interactive ``++role++`` attribute to it and manually manage its keyboard event handlers and focus. Common interactive roles include
``++button++``, ``++link++``, ``++checkbox++``, ``++menuitem++``, ``++menuitemcheckbox++``, ``++menuitemradio++``, ``++option++``, ``++radio++``, ``++searchbox++``, ``++switch++``, and ``++textbox++``.
