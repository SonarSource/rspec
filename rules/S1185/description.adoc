Overriding a method just to call the same method from the super class without performing any other actions is useless and misleading. The only time this is justified is in ``++final++`` overriding methods, where the effect is to lock in the parent class behavior. This rule ignores such overrides of ``++equals++``, ``++hashCode++`` and ``++toString++``.
