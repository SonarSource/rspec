In most companies the choice is done either to work with <code>PERFORM paragraph1</code> or with <code>PERFORM paragraph1 THRU paragraph2</code>. Mixing the two approches is error prone when creating a new paragraph in the middle of an existing source code because there is no easy way to know if an existing execution flow might go through this new paragraph. This rule helps sustain the use of <code>PERFORM ... THRU...</code>.
