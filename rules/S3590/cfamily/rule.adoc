Explicitly releasing non-heap memory leads to undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

The `free` function and `delete` operator are used exclusively to release dynamically allocated memory.
Attempting to release any other type of memory is _undefined behavior_.

The following non-heap memory types may not be released:

* Stack allocated memory - local variables or memory allocated with the `alloca`, `_alloca`, `_malloca` and `__builtin_alloca` functions.
* Executable program code - function pointers.
* Program data - global and static variables.
* Read-only program data - constants and strings.

=== What is the potential impact

The C and {cpp} standards define freeing non-heap memory as _undefined behavior_.

In all modern compilers, this scenario will result in a crash.

== How to fix it

Remove any calls to `free` or `delete` that aim at releasing non-heap memory.

=== Code examples

Stack allocated memory:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-type=noncompliant,diff-id=1]
----
void fun(int size) {
  int number = 0;
  char* name = (char*)alloca(size);
  // ...
  delete &number; // Noncompliant: memory is stack-allocated.
  free(name); // Noncompliant: memory is stack-allocated.
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-type=compliant,diff-id=1]
----
void fun(int size) {
  int number = 0;
  char* name = (char*)alloca(size);
  // ...
  // Compliant: stack memory is automatically released at the end of the function.
}
----

Program executable code:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-type=noncompliant,diff-id=2]
----
int getValue() {
  return 10;
}

void fun() {
  // ...
  free((void*) &getValue); // Noncompliant: memory is part of executable code.
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-type=compliant,diff-id=2]
----
int get10() {
  return 10;
}

void fun() {
  // ...
  // Compliant: program code will be released at the end of the program's execution.
}
----

Program data:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-type=noncompliant,diff-id=3]
----
struct S {
  static inline int data = 64;
};

void fun() {
  static int x = 8;
  // ...
  free(&x); // Noncompliant: memory part of the program's data.
  free(&S::data); // Noncompliant: memory part of the program's data.
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-type=compliant,diff-id=3]
----
struct S {
  static inline int data = 64;
};

void fun() {
  static int x = 8;
  // ...
  // Compliant: globals and static variables are released at the end of the program's execution.
}
----

Read-only program data:

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-type=noncompliant,diff-id=4]
----
int const limit = 128;

void fun() {
  char* name = "string";
  // ...
  free((void*)&limit); // Noncompliant: memory part of program's read-only data.
  free(name); // Noncompliant: memory part of read-only program data.
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-type=compliant,diff-id=4]
----
int const limit = 128;

void fun() {
  char const* name = "string";
  // ...
  // Compliant: read-only program data is freed at the end of the program's execution.
}
----


=== Going the extra mile

The accidental release of non-heap memory usually occurs in practice if the same pointer variable is used to once reference heap and once non-heap memory.
This may lead to confusion and should be avoided.
Specifically if the same pointer is used to reference heap and non-heap memory.


These best practices help to avoid accidentally releasing non-heap memory:
* If accessing different memory types, use different pointer variables.
* When passing non-heap memory addresses to functions, ensure that the functions do not attempt to release the memory.
* If manually managing dynamic memory, release it in the same scope where it was acquired.

The following example illustrates the usage of different pointers:

Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-type=noncompliant,diff-id=5]
----
void fun(int length) {
  static char smallString[32];
  char* usedString;

  if (length < 31) {
    usedString = smallString; // Pointer to stack memory assigned here
  } else {
    usedString = (char*)malloc(length + 1);
  }
  // ...
  free(usedString); // Noncompliant: if length < 31, the freed memory will be located on the stack.
}
----

Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-type=compliant,diff-id=5]
----
void fun(int length) {
  static char smallString[32];
  char* stackOrHeapString;
  char* heapString = nullptr;

  if (length < 31) {
    stackOrHeapString = smallString;
  } else {
    heapString = (char*)malloc(length + 1);
    stackOrHeapString = heapString;
  }
  // ...
  free(heapString); // Compliant: only the heap string will be freed if allocated.
}
----

The following example illustrates a case of passing a mixed pointer to an unsafe function:

Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-type=noncompliant,diff-id=6]
----
void use(char* string) {
  // ...
  free(string); // Noncompliant: pointer's origin is unknown. If non-heap, the program will crash.
}

void fun(int length) {
  static char smallString[32];
  char* usedString;

  if (length < 31) {
    usedString = smallString; // Pointer to stack memory assigned here
  } else {
    usedString = (char*)malloc(length + 1);
  }
  useAndClear(usedString); // If length < 31, the unsafe memory will free memory located on the stack.
}
----

Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-type=compliant,diff-id=6]
----
void use(char* string) {
  // ...
  // Compliant: memory no longer freed in the called function
}

void fun(int length) {
  static char smallString[32];
  if (length < 31) {
    use(smallString);
  } else {
    heapString = (char*)malloc(length + 1);
    use(heapString);
    free(heapString); // Compliant: memory released in the scope it was acquired in.
  }
}
