\[~samuel.mercier] I think you missed the mark on the message. It talks about macro expansion, but the code sample shows macro definitions as being noncompliant.


Also, you've tied this to Maintainability, but I think it's more than that. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/{cpp}_Programming/Programming_Languages/{cpp}/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor#The_dangers_of_macros[The dangers of macros].

\[~ann.campbell.2] I am tempted to say you are right. I am just wondering if we should flag definitions of macros or usage...

* If we flag definitions we might have a ton of false positive coming from the standard headers.
* If we flag usages will have multiple issues for the same definition.

\[~samuel.mercier] are the standard headers really going to be under analysis in a normal situation?
