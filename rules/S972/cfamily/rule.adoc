== Why is this an issue?

These are the only permitted uses of macros. {cpp} offers ``++const++`` variable and function templates, which provide a type-safe alternative to the preprocessor.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#define CLOCK (xtal/16) // Noncompliant, Constant expression
#define PLUS2(X) ((X) + 2) // Noncompliant, Macro expanding to expression
#define PI 3.14159F // Noncompliant, use "const" object instead
#define int32_t long // Noncompliant, use "typedef" instead
#define STARTIF if( // Noncompliant, language redefinition
#define INIT(value) {(value), 0, 0} // Noncompliant, braced initializer
#define HEADER "filename.h" // Noncompliant, string literal

// The following is compliant 
#define STOR extern // Compliant, storage class specifier

=== Message

Macro "xxx" is not an include guard, and does not expand to a type qualifier, or a storage class specifier.

\[~samuel.mercier] I think you missed the mark on the message. It talks about macro expansion, but the code sample shows macro definitions as being noncompliant.


Also, you've tied this to Maintainability, but I think it's more than that. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/{cpp}_Programming/Programming_Languages/{cpp}/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor#The_dangers_of_macros[The dangers of macros].

\[~ann.campbell.2] I am tempted to say you are right. I am just wondering if we should flag definitions of macros or usage...

* If we flag definitions we might have a ton of false positive coming from the standard headers.
* If we flag usages will have multiple issues for the same definition.

\[~samuel.mercier] are the standard headers really going to be under analysis in a normal situation?

\[~ann.campbell.2] correct, we will analyze them, but cannot report issues on them.
