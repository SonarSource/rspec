If a session ID can be guessed (not generated with a secure pseudo random generator, or with insufficient length ...) an attacker may be able to hijack another user's session.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* the session ID is not unique.
* the session ID is set from a user-controlled input.
* the session ID is generated with not secure pseudo random generator.
* the session ID length is too short.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Don't manually generate session IDs, use instead language based native functionality.


== Sensitive Code Example

----
session_id(bin2hex(random_bytes(4))); // Sensitive: 4 bytes is too short
session_id($_POST["session_id"]); // Sensitive: session ID can be specified by the user
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,php]
----
session_regenerate_id(); ; // Compliant
session_id(bin2hex(random_bytes(16))); // Compliant
----

As far as I can tell, this rule does not apply for Asp.Net. According to documentation: "The SessionID value is randomly generated by ASP.NET and stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser." Source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.sessionstate.httpsessionstate.sessionid?view=netframework-4.8#System_Web_SessionState_HttpSessionState_SessionID[HttpSessionState.SessionID Property]


This property is read-only (does not have a setter) and the class is sealed so this behavior cannot be easily changed.


For Asp.Net Core the behavior is similar. An implementation of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.isession.id?view=aspnetcore-5.0#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_ISession_Id[ISession] is provided by the framework and the *Id* is read-only.
