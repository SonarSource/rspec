Non-static variables initialized with <code>INZ()</code> are only reliably initialized on the first run through the code in a  "terminate and stay resident" (TSR) program. Subsequent calls to the program within the same job do not re-initialize the variable with the value from <code>INZ()</code> unless the last record indicator is set at the end of the program. 

Without setting the last record indicator, the assumptions the code makes about the variable's initial value will be wrong every time but one, potentially leading to bad program behavior.
