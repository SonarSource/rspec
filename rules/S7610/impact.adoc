=== What is the potential impact?

A breach resulting from logged sensitive data can cause irreparable reputational damage and erode user trust. This can lead to customer churn and negative publicity. Furthermore, such an incident can trigger significant legal and financial repercussions, including heavy fines under data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and potential class-action lawsuits. This places the business in a state of extended liability, requiring it to manage ongoing incident response, regulatory scrutiny, and legal obligations to all affected parties.
