On client-side applications, such as Android apps, logging sensitive information like passwords, personal data, or API keys, poses a significant security risk. While direct log access by other applications is restricted on modern Android, these logs can still be read by anyone with physical device access (e.g. via Logcat), on rooted devices, or by malicious apps with special permissions.

Even if not directly accessible to other apps, they might be stored on the device in plaintext, making them vulnerable if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised. Furthermore, these logs can be inadvertently collected and transmitted by crash reporting or analytics services, exposing sensitive data to third parties. This can lead to compromised user accounts, data breaches, and a loss of trust in the application.
