To prevent the exposure of sensitive data in Android application logs, the primary strategy is to avoid logging such information entirely. Developers should implement strict logging policies that explicitly forbid the inclusion of credentials, personal identifiers, or other confidential user data. When logging is necessary for debugging, it should be restricted to debug builds only. This can be achieved by leveraging tools like ProGuard or R8 to automatically strip `Log` calls from release builds. For cases where some user-related data is essential for context, implement data masking or sanitization techniques to redact the sensitive portions before logging.
