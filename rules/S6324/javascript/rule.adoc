== Why is this an issue?

Entries in the ASCII table below code 32 are known as control characters or non-printing characters. As they are not common in JavaScript strings, using these invisible characters in regular expressions is most likely a mistake.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const pattern1 = /\x1a/;             // Noncompliant: 1a (23 base 10) is less than 32
const pattern2 = new RegExp('\x1a'); // Noncompliant: 1a (23 base 10) is less than 32
----

Instead, one should only match printable characters in regular expressions.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const pattern1 = /\x20/;
const pattern2 = new RegExp('\x20');
