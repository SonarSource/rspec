== Why is this an issue?

This rule is a more precise version of S1308 preventing the use of ``++GO TO++``. The flow of a program is already complicated to understand with simple ``++GO TO++``s. It's even worse when a ``++GO TO++`` is executed conditionally like this is the case with ``++GO TO DEPENDING ON++``. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   ...
   GO TO PARAGRAPH-10
         PARAGRAPH-20
         PARAGRAPH-30
   DEPENDING ON WS-PARA-NUMBER *> Noncompliant
   ...
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cobol]
----
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   ...
   EVALUATE WS-PARA-NUMBER
      WHEN 1
         PERFORM PARAGRAPH-10
      WHEN 2
         PERFORM PARAGRAPH-20
      WHEN 3
         PERFORM PARAGRAPH-30
      WHEN OTHER
         PERFORM PARAGRAPH-99
   END-EVALUATE
   ...
