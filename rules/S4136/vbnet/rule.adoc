== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Interface IMyInterface 
    Function DoTheThing() As Integer
    Function DoTheOtherThing() As String // Noncompliant
    Function DoTheThing(ByVal Path As String) As Integer
End Interface
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Interface IMyInterface 
    Function DoTheThing() As Integer
    Function DoTheThing(ByVal Path As String) As Integer
    Function DoTheOtherThing() As String
End Interface
----

=== Exceptions

As it is common practice to group method declarations by implemented interface, no issue will be raised for interface implementations if grouped together with other members of that interface.


As it is also a common practice to group method declarations by accessibility level, no issue will be raised for method overloads having different access modifiers.

Example:

[source,vbnet]
----
Class MyClass

    Private Sub DoTheThing(s As String) ' Ok - this method is declared as Private while the other one is Public
        ' ...
    End Sub

    Private Sub DoTheOtherThing(s As String)
        ' ...
    End Sub

    Public Sub DoTheThing()
        ' ...
    End Sub

End Class
