== Why is this an issue?

Debug statements (ones with 'D' or 'd'  in the indicator area) should not be executed in production, but the ``++WITH DEBUGGING MODE++`` clause activates all debug lines, which could expose sensitive information to attackers. Therefore the ``++WITH DEBUGGING MODE++`` clause should be removed.
