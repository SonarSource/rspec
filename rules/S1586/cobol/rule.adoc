To prevent any unexpected behavior, data items must be initialized before being used by a ``++CALL++`` statement. A data item is considered to be initialized in the three following cases :

* One of its parents has been initialized
* It has been defined in the ``++LINKAGE-SECTION++``
* The ``++MOVE SPACE[S] TO ...++`` and then the ``++INITIALIZE++`` statements have been sequentially executed on this data item. Both statements are required in that order because the ``++INITIALIZE++`` statement doesn't initialize ``++FILLER++``s and non-named fields.

Be aware that activating this rule will impact the overall performance of the analysis.
