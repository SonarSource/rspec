== Why is this an issue?

Re-exporting is a feature that allows a file to import a component (object, function or primitive) from a module and add it to the exported components of the file's module. However, as the language allows a file to export a component without explicitly importing it, a reader may mistake a re-export with a simple export. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
export { foo } from 'someModule';

=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]

import { foo } from 'someModule';
export { foo };
