This rule raises an issue when a Grails domain class name or field name matches a SQL reserved keyword (such as `Order`, `Select`, `From`, `Where`, etc.).

== Why is this an issue?

SQL reserved keywords have special meaning in database systems and cannot be used directly as table or column names without escaping.

When you use SQL reserved keywords as domain class or field names in Grails, the GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping) framework attempts to create database tables and columns with these names. This leads to several problems:

* *Schema creation failures*: The database will reject attempts to create tables or columns with reserved keyword names, causing your application to fail during startup or migration.
* *Runtime SQL errors*: Even if the schema is created successfully (perhaps with manual escaping), queries generated by GORM may fail because the keywords are not properly escaped in all contexts.
* *Maintenance overhead*: You'll need to add explicit table and column name mappings in your domain classes to work around the naming conflicts, making your code more complex and harder to maintain.

SQL reserved keywords include common words like `ORDER`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP`, `HAVING`, `INDEX`, `TABLE`, `USER`, and many others. Different database systems may have slightly different sets of reserved keywords, but the core SQL standard keywords are consistent across most databases.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using SQL reserved keywords can cause application startup failures, runtime database errors, and force developers to add complex workarounds in their domain mappings. This increases maintenance burden and can lead to subtle bugs in database operations.

== How to fix it

Rename the domain class and fields to avoid SQL reserved keywords. Choose descriptive names that clearly represent your business domain without conflicting with SQL syntax.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Order { // Noncompliant - 'Order' is a SQL reserved keyword
    String select // Noncompliant - 'select' is a SQL reserved keyword
    String from   // Noncompliant - 'from' is a SQL reserved keyword
    String where  // Noncompliant - 'where' is a SQL reserved keyword
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class CustomerOrder {
    String selection
    String source
    String condition
}
----
