This rule raises an issue when strings or bytes are concatenated implicitly.

== Why is this an issue?

Python concatenates adjacent string or byte literals at compile time. It means that ``++"a" "b"++`` is equivalent to ``++"ab"++``. 
This is sometimes used to split a long string on multiple lines. However an implicit string concatenation can also be very confusing. 
In the following contexts it might indicate that a comma was forgotten:

* when the two strings are on the same line it looks like a badly formatted tuple. 
Parentheses are not mandatory to create a tuple, only the comma is.
* when the strings are in a list, a set or a tuple.


=== Exceptions

This rule will not raise any issues when there is a visible reason for the string concatenation:

* when the quotes used for both strings are different. This can be used to avoid escaping quotes.
* when the strings or bytes have different prefixes, i.e. "f" for f-strings, "r" for raw, "u" for unicode and no prefix for normal strings.
* when strings are visibly split to avoid long lines of code, i.e. when the first string ends with a space, punctuation or ``++\n++``.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def func():
    return "item1" "item2"  # Noncompliant

["1"  # Noncompliant
 "2",
 "a very"  # Noncompliant
 "long string"]
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
def func():
    return "item1", "item2"

["1",
 "2",
 "a very" +
 "long string"]
----

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

When the strings are on multiple lines:

* "Add a "+" operator to make the string concatenation explicit; or did you forget a comma?"
When the strings are on the same line:

* "Merge these implicitly concatenated strings; or did you forget a comma?"


=== Highlighting

Primary: The end quote of the first concatenated string/bytes literal

Secondary:

* location: the starting quote of the next string/bytes/literal
* no message
