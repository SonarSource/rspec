When using the ``++Stream++`` API, call chains should be simplified as much as possible to improve readability and maintainability.


This rule raises an issue when one of the following substitution can be made:

[frame=all]
[cols="^1,^1"]
|===
|Original|Preferred

|``++stream.collect(counting())++``|``++stream.count()++``
|``++stream.collect(maxBy(comparator))++``|``++stream.max(comparator)++``
|``++stream.collect(minBy(comparator))++``|``++stream.min(comparator)++``
|``++stream.collect(mapping(mapper))++``|``++stream.map(mapper).collect()++``
|``++stream.collect(reducing(...))++``|``++stream.reduce(...)++``
|``++stream.collect(summingInt(mapper))++``|``++stream.mapToInt(mapper).sum()++``
|``++stream.collect(summingLong(mapper))++``|``++stream.mapToLong(mapper).sum()++``
|``++stream.collect(summingDouble(mapper))++``|``++stream.mapToDouble(mapper).sum()++``
|===

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int count = stream.collect(counting());  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int count = stream.count();
