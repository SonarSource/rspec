== Why is this an issue?

The ``++cgi.force_redirect++`` _php.ini_ configuration is on by default, and it prevents unauthenticated access to scripts when PHP is running as a CGI. Unfortunately, it must be disabled on IIS, OmniHTTPD and Xitami, but in all other cases it should be on.


This rule raises an issue when when ``++cgi.force_redirect++`` is explicitly disabled.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
cgi.force_redirect=0  ; Noncompliant
