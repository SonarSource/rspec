The ``++cgi.force_redirect++`` _php.ini_ configuration controls the behavior of
the PHP engine when used in CGI mode. In particular, it prevents CGI scripts
from being directly requested, without prior weh server or application
processing.

When disabled, CGI script can, therefore, be requested directly.

== Why is this an issue?

Pre-processing on the server side is often required to check users
authentication when working in CGI mode. Those preliminary actions can also
position diverse configuration parameters that are necessary for the CGI script
to work properly.

If this configuration is not set up before access, the CGI might behave
unexpectedly, which can have various consequences. Mainly, authentication or
authorization are common threats in those cases.

== How to fix it

`cgi.force_redirect` should be enforced in the main PHP configuration file.

Note that this parameter is enabled by default.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source, php, diff-id=1, diff-type=noncompliant]
----
; php.ini
cgi.force_redirect=0  ; Noncompliant
----


==== Compliant solution

[source, php, diff-id=1, diff-type=compliant]
----
; php.ini
cgi.force_redirect=1  ; Noncompliant
----

=== Pitfalls

The `cgi.force_redirect` is not supported by all web servers. For example,
Microsoft IIS web server is unable to differentiate an internally redirected
request from a normal one.

If using such a server, the `cgi.force_redirect` parameter will have to be
disabled for the CGI scripts to work properly. In that case, it is important to
ensure the CGI behavior is aware of the security threat.
