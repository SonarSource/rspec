Test frameworks provide a mechanism to skip tests if their prerequisites are not met, by either calling dedicated methods (e.g: ``++unittest.TestCase.skipTest++``, ``++pytest.skip++``, ...) or using decorators (e.g: ``++unittest.skip++``, ``++pytest.mark.skip++``, ...)


Using a ``++return++`` statement instead will make the test succeed, even though no assertion has been performed. It is therefore better to flag the test as ``++skipped++`` in such situation.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++return++`` is performed conditionally at the beginning of a test method.


No issue will be raised if the ``++return++`` is unconditional as S1763 already raises an issue in such case.


The supported frameworks are ``++Pytest++`` and ``++Unittest++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
import unittest
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_something(self):
        if not external_resource_available():
            return  # Noncompliant
        self.assertEqual(foo(), 42)
----


== Compliant Solution

----
import unittest
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_something(self):
        if not external_resource_available():
            self.skipTest("prerequisite not met")
        self.assertEqual(foo(), 42)
----
