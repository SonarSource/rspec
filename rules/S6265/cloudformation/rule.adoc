== Sensitive Code Example

All users (ie: anyone in the world authenticated or not) have read and write permissions with the ``++PublicReadWrite++`` access control:

[source,yaml]
----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket' # Sensitive
    Properties: 
      BucketName: "mynoncompliantbucket"
      AccessControl: "PublicReadWrite"
----

== Compliant Solution

With the ``++private++`` access control (default), only the bucket owner has the read/write permissions on the buckets and its ACL.

[source,yaml]
----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket' # Compliant
    Properties:
      BucketName: "mycompliantbucket"
      AccessControl: "Private"
