== Sensitive Code Example

All users, either authenticated or anonymous, have read and write permissions with the `PUBLIC_READ_WRITE` access control:

[source,javascript]
----
const s3 = require('aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3');

new s3.Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ_WRITE // Sensitive
});

new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ_WRITE // Sensitive
});
----

== Compliant Solution

With the `PRIVATE` access control (default), only the bucket owner has the read/write permissions on the bucket and its ACL.

[source,javascript]
----
const s3 = require('aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3');

new s3.Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE
});

new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE
});
----
