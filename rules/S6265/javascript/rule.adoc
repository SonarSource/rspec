== Sensitive Code Example

All users (ie: anyone in the world authenticated or not) have read and write permissions with the `PUBLIC_READ_WRITE` access control:

[source,python]
----
new s3.Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ_WRITE // Sensitive
});

new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ_WRITE // Sensitive
});
----

== Compliant Solution

With the `PRIVATE` access control (default), only the bucket owner has the read/write permissions on the bucket and its ACL.

[source,python]
----
new s3.Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE // Compliant
});

new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
    accessControl: s3.BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE // Compliant
});
----
