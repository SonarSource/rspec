== Sensitive Code Example

All users (ie: anyone in the world authenticated or not) have read and write permissions with the `PUBLIC_READ_WRITE` access control:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "bucket",
    access_control=s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ_WRITE     # Sensitive
)

s3deploy.BucketDeployment(self, "DeployWebsite",
    access_control=s3.BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ_WRITE     # Sensitive
)
----

== Compliant Solution

With the `PRIVATE` access control (default), only the bucket owner has the read/write permissions on the buckets and its ACL.

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "bucket",
    access_control=s3.BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE       # Compliant
)

# Another example
s3deploy.BucketDeployment(self, "DeployWebsite",
    access_control=s3.BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE       # Compliant
)
----
