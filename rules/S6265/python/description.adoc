Predefined permissions, also known as https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl[canned ACLs], are an easy way to grant large privileges to predefined groups or users.

The following canned ACLs are security-sensitive:

* `PUBLIC_READ`, `PUBLIC_READ_WRITE` grant respectively "read" and "read and write" privileges to everyone in the world (`AllUsers` group).
* `AUTHENTICATED_READ` grants "read" privilege to all authenticated users (`AuthenticatedUsers` group).
