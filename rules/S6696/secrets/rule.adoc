=== What is the potential impact?

SendGrid keys are used for authentication and authorization when using the
SendGrid email delivery service.

If a SendGrid key were to accidentally fall into the hands of unintended
recipients, it could have severe repercussions for your email delivery.

Firstly, unauthorized individuals who gain access to your SendGrid account could
exploit its features to send emails on your behalf. This unauthorized access
might result in the sending of spam emails, phishing attempts, or other forms of
unsolicited and potentially harmful content. This not only compromises the
integrity of your email communications but also poses a risk to the recipients
who may unknowingly engage with malicious messages.

Secondly, the leaked SendGrid key could trigger a high volume of email activity,
potentially raising suspicions. SendGrid, being vigilant
about such activities, may flag your account and take action against it. This
could lead to the suspension or termination of your SendGrid account, disrupting
your email delivery service and causing significant inconvenience and potential
loss of communication with your customers or clients.
