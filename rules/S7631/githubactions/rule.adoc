When using GitHub Actions, certain workflow triggers such as `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run` execute with the repository's privileges.
This creates a security risk when these workflows check out code from a forked repository and then use this untrusted code as input for subsequent steps.

If code from the fork is used as an input inside the workflow, they could exploit this to extract sensitive information, manipulate the repository, or execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the repository. Special considerations should be taken into account on organizations and repositories created before 2023 when https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-02-github-actions-updating-the-default-github_token-permissions-to-read-only/[the default permissions of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` were changed to read-only].

== Ask Yourself Whether

* Is the checked out code executed directly as part of some steps in the workflow?
* Can the checked out code _indirectly_ affect the execution of the workflow? For example, does your workflow use configuration files to download packages from package repositories?

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

If the flow does not require write access to the repository nor access to its secrets, the recommended approach is to avoid using triggers that cause execution using elevated privileges.

If this is not feasible, the workflow can be split into two parts:

* An unprivileged job that gets triggered by `pull_request` that performs checks that do not require elevated permissions, and
* A privileged job that is triggered by `workflow_run` on completion of the first job, that performs the actions requiring elevated permissions

When doing this, it is important to make sure that the privileged workflow does not process input from the untrusted workflow.


== Sensitive Code Example

The following workflow executes the `build.sh` script from the fork using the privileges of the repository:

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request_target:  # Sensitive

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}  # Sensitive

      - name: Build
        run: |
          ./build.sh
----

== Compliant solution

If elevated permissions are not needed, the simplest way to fix this is to use `pull_request` as the trigger.

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:  # Compliant

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

      - name: Build
        run: |
          ./build.sh
----

If access to repository secrets or write access to the repository is required, consider splitting the job into two separate workflows:

* The first workflow gets triggered on `pull_request` and checks out the code from the fork with limited permissions, storing the results in artifacts or outputs.
* The second workflow gets triggered on `workflow_run` on completion of the first. This workflow reads the sanitized result from the first workflow.
