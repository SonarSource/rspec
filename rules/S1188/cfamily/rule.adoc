== Why is this an issue?

Lambdas (introduced in {cpp}11) are a very convenient and compact way to inject a behavior without having to create a dedicated function. But those lambdas should be used only if the behavior to be injected can be defined in a few lines of code, otherwise the source code can quickly become unreadable.
