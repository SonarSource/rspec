== Why is this an issue?

The use of ``++DUMP++`` and ``++DUMP TRANSACTION++``, while potentially useful during development and debugging, could expose system information to attackers and should not be used in production.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
EXEC CICS DUMP TRANSACTION  *> Noncompliant
  DUMPCODE('dumpfile')
  FROM (area-to-dump)
  LENGTH (data-to-dump)
END-EXEC.
