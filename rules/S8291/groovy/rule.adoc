This rule raises an issue when a private method is declared but never called within the class.

== Why is this an issue?

Unused private methods represent dead code that serves no purpose in the application. These methods add unnecessary complexity to the codebase and can confuse developers who encounter them.

Dead code occurs when methods are written but never actually used. This can happen during development when:

* Methods are created for future use but never implemented
* Refactoring removes the need for certain methods but leaves them behind
* Copy-paste programming introduces methods that aren't needed in the new context

Unused private methods are particularly problematic because:

* They cannot be called from outside the class, so there's no external dependency
* They increase the cognitive load when reading and understanding the code
* They can mislead developers into thinking the method serves a purpose
* They contribute to code bloat and maintenance overhead

Since private methods can only be accessed within the same class, the analyzer can definitively determine if they are unused by checking all method calls within that class scope.

=== What is the potential impact?

Unused private methods negatively impact code maintainability and readability. They create confusion for developers who must spend time understanding code that serves no purpose. This dead code also increases the overall size of the codebase without providing any value, making the code harder to navigate and maintain.

== How to fix it

Remove the unused private method entirely. Since it's never called, removing it will not affect the application's functionality.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class UserService {
    def processUser(user) {
        return validateUser(user)
    }
    
    private def validateUser(user) {
        return user != null
    }
    
    private def formatUserData(user) { // Noncompliant
        return user.toString().toUpperCase()
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class UserService {
    def processUser(user) {
        return validateUser(user)
    }
    
    private def validateUser(user) {
        return user != null
    }
}
