== Why is this an issue?

When an object is declared with ``++const++`` class type, only ``++const++`` member functions can be invoked on that object. The common expectation of ``++const++`` member functions is that the state of the object may not be modified when invoking the functions. However, returning a non-const pointer or reference to class-data from a ``++const++`` function allows a modification to the conceptual state of an object.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class C
{
public:
  C(int32_t & value) : a(&value), b(value) { }
  int32_t * getA () const // Noncompliant, "const" method returns a non-const pointer to data
  {
    return a;
  }
  int32_t & getB () const // Noncompliant, "const" method returns a non-const reference to data
  {
    return b;
  }
private:
  int32_t * a;
  int32_t & b;
};

void fn ( C const & c )
{
  c.getA()[ 0 ] = 0; // Hazardous: modification to conceptual state of C from the returned value of a const method
  c.getB() = 0; // Hazardous: modification to conceptual state of C from the returned value of a const method
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class C
{
public:
  C(int32_t & value) : a(&value), b(value) { }
  int32_t const * getA () const // Compliant, "const" method returns a "const" pointer to data
  {
    return a;
  }
  int32_t const & getB () const // Compliant, "const" method returns a "const" reference to data
  {
    return b;
  }
private:
  int32_t * a;
  int32_t & b;
};

void fn ( C const & c )
{
  c.getA()[ 0 ] = 0; // Compliant, rejected during compliation
  c.getB() = 0; // Compliant, rejected during compilation
}
