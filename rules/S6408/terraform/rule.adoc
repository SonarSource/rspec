Creating custom roles that allow privilege escalation can allow attackers to
maliciously exploit an organization's cloud resources.

Certain GCP permissions allow impersonation of one or more privileged principals
within a GCP infrastructure. +
To prevent privilege escalation after an account has been compromised,
proactively follow GCP Security Insights and ensure that custom roles contain
as few privileges as possible that allow direct or indirect impersonation.

For example, privileges like `deploymentmanager.deployments.create` allow
impersonation of service accounts, even if the name does not sound like it. +
Other privileges like `setIamPolicy`, which are more explicit, directly allow
their holder to extend their privileges.

After gaining a foothold in the target infrastructure, sophisticated attackers
typically map their newfound roles to understand what is exploitable.

The riskiest privileges are either:

* At the infrastructure level: privileges to perform project, folder, or
  organization-wide administrative tasks.
* At the resource level: privileges to perform resource-wide administrative tasks.

In either case, the following privileges should be avoided or granted only with
caution:

* `*.*.setIamPolicy`
* `cloudbuilds.builds.create`
* `cloudfunctions.functions.create`
* `cloudfunctions.functions.update`
* `cloudscheduler.jobs.create`
* `composer.environments.create`
* `compute.instances.create`
* `dataflow.jobs.create`
* `dataproc.clusters.create`
* `deploymentmanager.deployments.create`
* `iam.roles.update`
* `iam.serviceAccountKeys.create`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt`
* `orgpolicy.policy.set`
* `run.services.create`
* `serviceusage.apiKeys.create`
* `serviceusage.apiKeys.list`
* `storage.hmacKeys.create`

== Ask Yourself Whether

* Impersonation is required to use this custom role.
* This custom role is intended for a small group of administrators.
 
There is a risk if you answered no to these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Use a permission that does not allow privilege escalation. 

== Sensitive Code Example

Lightweight custom role intended for a user who needs to develop:

----
resource "google_organization_iam_custom_role" "example" {
  permissions = [
    "iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken",     # Sensitive
    "iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken",     # Sensitive
    "iam.serviceAccounts.actAs",              # Sensitive
    "iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation", # Sensitive
    "resourcemanager.projects.get",
    "resourcemanager.projects.list",
    "run.services.create",
    "run.services.delete",
    "run.services.get",
    "run.services.getIamPolicy",
    "run.services.list",
    "run.services.update",
  ]
}
----

Lightweight custom role intended for a user who only needs visibility:

----
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "example" {
  permissions = [
    "iam.serviceAccountKeys.create",        # Sensitive
    "iam.serviceAccountKeys.get",           # Sensitive
    "deploymentmanager.deployments.create", # Sensitive
    "cloudbuild.builds.create",             # Sensitive
    "resourcemanager.projects.get",
    "resourcemanager.projects.list",
    "run.services.get",
    "run.services.getIamPolicy",
    "run.services.list",
  ]
}
----

== Compliant Solution

Lightweight custom role intended for a user who needs to develop:

----
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "example" {
  permissions = [
    "resourcemanager.projects.get",
    "resourcemanager.projects.list",
    "run.services.create",
    "run.services.delete",
    "run.services.get",
    "run.services.getIamPolicy",
    "run.services.list",
    "run.services.update",
  ]
}
----

Lightweight custom role intended for a user who only needs visibility:

----
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "example" {
  permissions = [
    "resourcemanager.projects.get",
    "resourcemanager.projects.list",
    "run.services.get",
    "run.services.getIamPolicy",
    "run.services.list",
  ]
}
