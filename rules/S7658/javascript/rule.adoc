This rule raises an issue when deprecated Node.js APIs are used in the code.

== Why is this an issue?

Node.js has deprecated many APIs over time as the platform has evolved. These deprecated APIs are marked for removal in future versions of Node.js, which means code using them will eventually break when upgrading to newer Node.js versions.

Using deprecated APIs can lead to:

* **Compatibility issues**: Code may stop working when upgrading Node.js versions
* **Security vulnerabilities**: Deprecated APIs may have known security issues that won't be fixed
* **Performance problems**: Newer replacement APIs are often more efficient
* **Maintenance burden**: Deprecated APIs lack ongoing support and documentation

The Node.js team provides clear migration paths and alternative APIs for most deprecated functionality. For example, the deprecated `fs.exists()` should be replaced with `fs.access()` or `fs.stat()`, and the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor should be replaced with `Buffer.from()`, `Buffer.alloc()`, or `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using deprecated APIs can cause applications to break when upgrading Node.js versions. It may also expose applications to security vulnerabilities or performance issues that won't be addressed in deprecated APIs.

=== How to fix?


Replace deprecated APIs with their modern equivalents. Check the Node.js documentation for the recommended replacement for each deprecated API.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const fs = require('fs');

// Using deprecated fs.exists()
fs.exists('./file.txt', (exists) => { // Noncompliant
  console.log(exists);
});

// Using deprecated Buffer constructor
const buffer = new Buffer('hello'); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const fs = require('fs');

// Use fs.access() instead of fs.exists()
fs.access('./file.txt', fs.constants.F_OK, (err) => {
  console.log(!err);
});

// Use Buffer.from() instead of Buffer constructor
const buffer = Buffer.from('hello');
