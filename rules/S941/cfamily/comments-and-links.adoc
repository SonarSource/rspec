@Ann, if my feeling is correct there is a misunderstanding somewhere because for me the main goal of those MISRA rules is to prevent any expression on pointers :

----
uint8_t * p1;
uint8_t * p2;

p1++; //non compliant
p2--; //non compliant
p1 - p2; //non compliant
p1 < p2; //non compliant
----

The only exception is when those pointers are used to address an array element.


According to the provided code snippets, I've the feeling that you're trying to cover check something else : prevent accessing to an array element outside of the known limit of the array.

\[~freddy.mallet] I had the same initial impression from reading the MISRA rule titles. 


The 2004 descriptions are quite curt, but the description and code samples for the 2012 versions of the same rules are quite extensive. To your specific concern, using pointer math to access an array element outside the bounds of the array is the first thing mentioned in MISRA C:2012, 18.1.


I was very tempted to leave out much of the detail, or to try to split it into multiple rules, but in the end decided it was all integral to the same topic.

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/131[CWE-131] relates to this rule but has a broader scope (some of which is handled in RSPEC-2613). How would you like to handle? Move all access-beyond-end-of-buffer to a separate rule?

I have modified the rule to remove everything related to arrays out of bounds so that it does not overlap with https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-3519[RSPEC-3519] which deals with buffer overflows in general.
