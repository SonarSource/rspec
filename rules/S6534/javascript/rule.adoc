== Why is this an issue?

Numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64-bit floating-point. However, numbers that can't be represented in such a format get rounded before assigning them to a variable.

=== What is the potential impact?

When you are saving a number that is too big or contains a fraction that is not expressible in the 64-bit floating-point format, it gets rounded which will lead to unexpected behaviours when it will be used.

== How to fix it

When you need to store a large number, use `BigInt()`. Pay attention that operations between `BigInt` and `Number` types raise an error, so you will have to adapt your code accordingly.

For numbers with digits after the decimal, it is recommended to use a library to ensure that calculation errors are not introduced by rounding.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const foo = 2312123211345545367 // Noncompliant: will be stored as 2312123211345545000
const bar = 0.123456789123456789 // Noncompliant: will be stored as 0.12345678912345678
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const foo = BigInt(2312123211345545367)
// Use a library like decimal.js for storing numbers containing decimal digits
----

=== How does this work?

JavaScript numbers are stored in a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. There are limits to what can be stored in this format both in huge numbers as in numbers with decimal digits.
When attempting to store a number that can not be represented in this format into a variable, the number gets rounded before storage.
