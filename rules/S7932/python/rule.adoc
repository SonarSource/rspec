This rule raises an issue when `return`, `break`, or `continue` statements are used to exit a `finally` block.

== Why is this an issue?

Using `return`, `break`, or `continue` statements that exit a `finally` block can lead to confusing control flow and unexpected behavior. When these statements exit a `finally` block, they can mask exceptions that were raised in the corresponding `try` or `except` blocks, making debugging difficult.

Starting with Python 3.14, this pattern emits a `SyntaxWarning` as specified in PEP 765, indicating that this usage is discouraged and may become a syntax error in future Python versions. The `finally` block is intended for cleanup code that should always execute, regardless of how the `try` block exits. When control flow statements exit the `finally` block, they can interfere with this guarantee.

Additionally, this pattern can make code harder to understand and maintain, as the actual exit point becomes unclear when reading the code.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using control flow statements that exit `finally` blocks can lead to:

* **Debugging difficulties**: The actual cause of issues may be hidden when exceptions are suppressed unexpectedly
* **Future compatibility issues**: Code may break in future Python versions when this becomes a syntax error
* **Reduced code maintainability**: Control flow becomes harder to follow and understand

=== How to fix?


Move the return statement outside the finally block and use a variable to store the return value if needed.
