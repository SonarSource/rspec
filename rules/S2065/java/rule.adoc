``++transient++`` is used to mark fields in a ``++Serializable++`` class which will not be written out to file (or stream). In a class that does not implement ``++Serializable++``, this modifier is simply wasted keystrokes, and should be removed.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,java]
----
class Vegetable {  // does not implement Serializable
  private transient Season ripe;  // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,java]
----
class Vegetable {
  private Season ripe;
  // ...
}
----
