When you add a new constraint to a table, (``++ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ...++``), ``++WITH CHECK++`` is assumed by default, and existing data are automatically validated.


But when you disable/enable an existing constraint, ``++WITH NOCHECK++`` is assumed by default, and existing data are no longer trusted. In this case you will face an integrity issue that prevents some rows from being updated, and a performance issue because the query optimizer cannot trust this constraint anymore. 


Of course, ``++WITH CHECK++`` is obviously preferred, but if ``++NOCHECK++`` behavior is desired, it should not be selected by omission, but specified explicitly because ``++WITH NOCHECK++`` has such a significant impact. By making ``++NOCHECK++`` explicit, the developer documents that this behavior has been selected on purpose.


Note: You can list the existing constraints that are in an untrusted state using:

``++SELECT * FROM sys.foreign_keys WHERE is_not_trusted = 1;++``

``++SELECT * FROM sys.check_constraints WHERE is_not_trusted = 1;++``


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
-- Create a trusted constraint
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT max_age CHECK (age < 200) ;

-- Disable the constraint
ALTER TABLE users NOCHECK CONSTRAINT max_age;

-- Enable the constraint
ALTER TABLE users CHECK CONSTRAINT max_age; -- Noncompliant, 'WITH NOCHECK' is the default mode, but is it really intentional?
----


== Compliant Solution

----
-- Create a trusted constraint
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT max_age CHECK (age < 200) ;

-- Disable the constraint
ALTER TABLE users NOCHECK CONSTRAINT max_age;

-- Enable the constraint
ALTER TABLE users WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT max_age;
-- OR
ALTER TABLE users WITH NOCHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT max_age;
