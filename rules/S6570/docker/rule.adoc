Variable references should be encapsulated with double quotes to avoid globbing and word splitting.

== Why is this an issue?

Within the command, variable references and command substitutions go through word splitting and pathname expansion (globbing).

This causes issues if the variable contains whitespaces or shell pathname expansion (glob) characters like `*`.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue can lead to bugs if the variable contains sensitive characters, which may be interpreted incorrectly and thus lead to undesired behavior.

== How to fix it

Surround variable reference with double quotes.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

This example demonstrates pathname expansion using the `echo` command:
[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
RUN test="command t*.sh" && echo $test
----
Suppose this code is executed in a directory that contains two files: `temp1.sh` and `temp2.sh`. This code will print `"command temp1.sh temp2.sh"`,
as `*` is substituted with matching files in the current folder.

This example demonstrates word splitting using the `echo` command:
[source,docker,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
RUN test=" Hello World " && echo $test
----
This code will print `"Hello World"`, omitting the leading and trailing whitespaces.

==== Compliant solution

This example demonstrates pathname expansion using the `echo` command, which will print ``++"command t*.sh"++`` as intended:
[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
RUN test="command t*.sh" && echo "$test"
----

This example demonstrates word splitting using the `echo` command, which will print `" Hello World "` as intended:
[source,docker,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
RUN test=" Hello World " && echo "$test"
----

Surround this variable with double quotes; otherwise, it can lead to unexpected behavior.
