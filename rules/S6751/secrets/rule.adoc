=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

PyPI API tokens can be used to authenticate with PyPI by setting the token as a password in `.pypirc`.

[source,text]
----
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-YBf3ZAIKOMPwNZ1VaQ0RAtjww5lI1az1CMLEOWgDQN56EPADfzRmgsENVcmIUh2mSBwYlTtyNKGmVlLm2MZD2aJOTWmD2EO5PMyWjvUY3Ii2CjsidALCNCNmvX8N8gcijBliFN2ciBCLgQdi2YYfGjA1kz19z1UBKg
----

==== Compliant solution

Instead, Python's https://pypi.org/project/keyring/[`keyring` package] can be used to securely authenticate with PyPI. Once `keyring` is installed using pip, it should be used for authentication automatically. It is also possible to configure it manually using the following:

[source,bash]
----
pip config set --global global.keyring-provider subprocess
