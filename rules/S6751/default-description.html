<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The exact consequences of a PyPI API token compromise can vary depending on the scope of the affected token. Depending on this factor, the attacker might get access to the full account the token is bound to or only to a project belonging to that user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, such a compromise can lead to source code leaks, data leaks and even serious supply chain attacks. In general, a reputational loss is also a common threat.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_source_code">Compromise of sensitive source code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The affected service is used to store private packages and repositories. If a token is leaked, it can be used by unauthorized individuals to gain access to your sensitive code, proprietary libraries, and other confidential resources. This can lead to intellectual property theft, unauthorized modifications, or even sabotage of your software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these private packages contain other secrets, it might even lead to further breaches in the organization&#8217;s services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_supply_chain_attacks">Supply chain attacks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the leaked secret gives an attacker the ability to publish code to private packages or repositories under the name of the organization, then there may exist grave consequences beyond the compromise of source code. The attacker may inject malware, backdoors, or other harmful code into these private repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can cause further security breaches inside the organization, but will also affect clients if the malicious code gets added to any products. Distributing code that (unintentionally) contains backdoors or malware can lead to widespread security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For PyPI, <code>keyring</code> is a recommended solution to securely store secrets. Further explanation is given in the example below.</p>

<p>Instead, Python&#8217;s <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyring/"><code>keyring</code> package</a> can be used to securely authenticate with PyPI. Once <code>keyring</code> is installed using pip, it should be used for authentication automatically. It is also possible to configure it manually using the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pip config set --global global.keyring-provider subprocess</code></pre>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_reducing_the_permission_scope_per_secret">Reducing the permission scope per secret</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By reducing the permission scope, the token is granted only the minimum set of permissions required to perform its intended tasks. This follows the principle of least privilege, which states that a user or token should have only the necessary privileges to carry out its specific functions. By adhering to this principle, the potential attack surface is minimized, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, if a token is compromised, the reduced permissions scope limits the potential damage that can be done. With fewer permissions, the attacker&#8217;s ability to access or modify critical resources is restricted, reducing the impact of the compromise.</p>
