=== What is the potential impact?

API tokens get access to the Fastly API. Tokens can be granted restricted
permissions that limit access to Fastly services and resources, such as

* Load Balancers
* Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
* TLS configuration
* Access Control Lists (ACL)
* etc.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
