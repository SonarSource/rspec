== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,python]
----
def func(a, b, compute):
    i = a + b  # Noncompliant; calculation result not used before value is overwritten
    i = compute()  # Noncompliant; the value is not used before leaving the function
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,python]
----
def func(a, b, compute):
    i = a + b
    i += compute()
    return i
----

== Exceptions
