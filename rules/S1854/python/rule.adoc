== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
def func(a, b, compute):
    i = a + b  # Noncompliant; calculation result not used before value is overwritten
    i = compute()
    return i
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
def func(a, b, compute):
    i = a + b
    i += compute()
    return i
----

=== Exceptions

This rule ignores initializations to -1, 0, 1, ``++None++``, ``++True++``, ``++False++`` and ``++""++``.
