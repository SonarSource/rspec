=== Exceptions

No issue is reported when 

* the analyzed method body contains `try` blocks 
* a lambda expression captures the local variable
* the variable is unused (case covered by Rule S1481)
* it's an initialization to `-1`, `0`, `1`, `null`, `true`, `false`, `""` or `string.Empty`

You can also use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/discards[discards] (rather than a variable) to express that result of a method call is ignored on purpose. 

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int Foo(int y)
{
  int x = 100; // Noncompliant: dead store
  x = 150;     // Noncompliant: dead store  
  x = 200;
  return x + y;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int Foo(int y)
{
  int x = 200; // Compliant: no unnecessary assignment
  return x + y;
}
----
