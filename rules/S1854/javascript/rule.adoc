== Exceptions

This rule ignores initializations to -1, 0, 1, ``++null++``, ``++undefined++``, [], \{\}, ``++true++``, ``++false++`` and ``++""++``. Variables that start with an underscore (e.g. '``++_unused++``') are ignored.

This rule also ignores variables declared with object destructuring using rest syntax (used to exclude some properties from object):

----
let {a, b, ...rest} = obj; // 'a' and 'b' are ok
doSomething(rest);

let [x1, x2, x3] = arr;    // but 'x1' is noncompliant, as omitting syntax can be used: "let [, x2, x3] = arr;"
doSomething(x2, x3);
----
