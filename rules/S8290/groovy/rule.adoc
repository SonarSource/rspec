This rule raises an issue when a private field is declared in a class but never referenced within that same class.

== Why is this an issue?

Unused private fields are dead code that serves no purpose in your application. They create several problems:

**Maintenance burden**: Dead code makes your codebase larger and harder to understand. Developers waste time reading and trying to understand code that doesn't actually do anything.

**Confusion and assumptions**: When developers see a private field, they naturally assume it serves a purpose. Unused fields can lead to incorrect assumptions about how the class works or what data it maintains.

**Incomplete implementation**: Unused private fields often indicate incomplete features or refactoring that wasn't finished. They can be a sign that code was partially removed but not completely cleaned up.

**Code bloat**: Over time, accumulating unused fields contributes to code bloat, making classes unnecessarily large and complex to navigate.

Removing unused private fields keeps your code clean, focused, and easier to maintain.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue affects code maintainability and developer productivity. While not a security risk, unused private fields make the codebase harder to understand and maintain, potentially slowing down development and increasing the likelihood of bugs in related code.

== How to fix it

Remove the unused private field entirely if it serves no purpose.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class UserService {
    private String unusedApiKey = "secret-key" // Noncompliant
    private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService)
    
    def processUser(User user) {
        logger.info("Processing user: ${user.name}")
        return user.process()
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class UserService {
    private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService)
    
    def processUser(User user) {
        logger.info("Processing user: ${user.name}")
        return user.process()
    }
}
