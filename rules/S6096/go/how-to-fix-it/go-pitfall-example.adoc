The non-compliant code example is also vulnerable to partial path injection.
Note how the target directory does not have a trailing path separator.

Even if the directory prefix would be checked, the check could be bypassed by using a path that is a prefix of the target directory.
For example, `/tmp/uploads_injectedfile.php` could be slipped into the system and combined with other vulnerabilities to form an attack chain.
