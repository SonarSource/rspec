==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Private Shared TargetDirectory As String = "/example/directory/"

    Public Sub ExtractEntry(EntriesEnumerator As IEnumerator(Of ZipArchiveEntry))
        Dim Entry As ZipArchiveEntry = EntriesEnumerator.Current
        Dim DestinationPath As String = Path.Combine(TargetDirectory, Entry.FullName)

        Entry.ExtractToFile(DestinationPath)
    End Sub
End Class

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Private Shared TargetDirectory As String = "/example/directory/"
    
    Public Sub ExtractEntry(EntriesEnumerator As IEnumerator(Of ZipArchiveEntry))
        Dim Entry As ZipArchiveEntry = EntriesEnumerator.Current
        Dim DestinationPath As String = Path.Combine(TargetDirectory, Entry.FullName)
        Dim CanonicalDestinationPath As String = Path.GetFullPath(DestinationPath)

        If CanonicalDestinationPath.StartsWith(TargetDirectory, StringComparison.Ordinal) Then
            Entry.ExtractToFile(CanonicalDestinationPath)
        End If
    End Sub
End Class

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/how-does-this-work.adoc[]

=== Pitfalls

include::../../common/pitfalls/partial-path-traversal.adoc[]

For example, the following code is vulnerable to partial path injection. Note
that the string `TargetDirectory` does not end with a path separator:


[source, vbnet]
----
Private Shared TargetDirectory As String = "/Users/John"

Public Sub ExtractEntry(entriesEnumerator As IEnumerator(Of ZipArchiveEntry))
    Dim entry As ZipArchiveEntry = entriesEnumerator.Current
    Dim canonicalDestinationPath As String = Path.GetFullPath(TargetDirectory)

    If canonicalDestinationPath.StartsWith(TargetDirectory, StringComparison.Ordinal) Then
        entry.ExtractToFile(canonicalDestinationPath)
    End If
End Sub
----

This check can be bypassed because `"/Users/Johnny".startsWith("/Users/John")`
returns `true`. Thus, for validation, `"/Users/John"` should actually be
`"/Users/John/"`.

**Warning**: Some functions remove the terminating path separator in their
return value. +
The validation code should be tested to ensure that it cannot be impacted by this
issue.
