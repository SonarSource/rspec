=== What is the potential impact?

A web application is vulnerable to Zip Slip and an attacker is able to exploit it by submitting an archive he controls.

The files that can be affected are limited by the permission of the process that runs the application. Worst case scenario: the process runs with root privileges on Linux, and therefore any file can be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various effects of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Override arbitrary files

The application opens the archive to copy its entries to the file system. The entries' names contain path traversal payloads for existing files in the system, which are overwritten once the entries are copied. The vulnerability is exploited to corrupt files critical for the application or operating system to work properly.
It could result in data being lost or the application being unavailable.
