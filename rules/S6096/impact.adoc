=== What is the potential impact?

A web application is vulnerable to Zip Slip and an attacker is able to exploit it by submitting an archive he controls.

The files that can be affected are limited by the permission of the process that runs the application. Worst case scenario: the process runs with root privileges on Linux, and therefore any file can be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various effects of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Override arbitrary files

The archive is open by the application to copy entries to the file system. Archive entry names tamper with the location of a file the application is supposed to copy resulting in files being overwritten. The vulnerability is exploited to corrupt files that are critical for the application or for the system to work properly.
It could result in data being lost or the application being unavailable.
