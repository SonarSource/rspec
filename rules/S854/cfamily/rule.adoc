== Why is this an issue?

The type of an integer is dependent on a complex combination of factors including:

* The magnitude of the constant;
* The implemented sizes of the integer types;
* The presence of any suffixes;
* The number base in which the value is expressed (i.e. decimal, octal or hexadecimal).

For example, the value 0x8000 is of type ``++unsigned int++`` in a 16-bit environment, but of type (``++signed++``) ``++int++`` in a 32-bit environment.

Note:

* Any value with a "U" suffix is of unsigned type;
* An unsuffixed decimal value less than 2^31 is of signed type.

But:

* An unsuffixed hexadecimal value greater than or equal to 2^15 may be of signed or unsigned type;
* For C90, an unsuffixed decimal value greater than or equal to 2^31 may be of signed or unsigned type.

In {cpp}, if an overload set includes candidates for an ``++unsigned int++`` and an ``++int++``, then the overload that would be matched by 0x8000 is therefore dependent on the implemented integer size. Adding a "U" suffix to the value specifies that it is unsigned.


== Resources

* MISRA C:2004, 10.6 - A "U" suffix shall be applied to all constants of unsigned type.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 2-13-3 - A "U" suffix shall be applied to all octal or hexadecimal integer literals of unsigned type.
* MISRA C:2012, 7.2 - A "u" or "U" suffix shall be applied to all integer constants that are represented in an unsigned type.
