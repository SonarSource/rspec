And I have the feeling that even in Java or C# for instance for which the default values of primitive types is known, this is a kind of reliability issue to rely on some paths on the those default values. (cc [~ann.campbell.2])

public int compute(Strong something){
  int returnValue;
  if(something.equals("foo")) {
    returnValue = 4;
  }
  return returnValue;
}
