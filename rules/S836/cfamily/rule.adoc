Variables should be initialized before their use to avoid unexpected
behavior due to garbage values.

== Why is this an issue?

A local variable of any built-in type (such as `int`, `float`, and pointers),
declared without an initial value is not initialized to any particular value.
Consequently, if no value is assigned to such a variable first, the code that
uses it has no defined behavior.

[source,cpp]
----
int addition() {
  int x;  // x is not initialized
  return x + 10; // Noncompliant: x has grabage value
}

int dereference() {
  int* p; // p is not initialized
  return *p; // Noncompliant: p has garbage value
}
----

Similarly, structures that simply aggregate variables of built-in types, such as arrays or `struct`/`class`
types without a constructor, will not initialize their members when declared without
an initializer:

[source,cpp]
----
struct Aggregate {
  int i;
  float f;
};

void aggregates() {
  int* intArray[5]; // each element of array is not initializer
  Aggregate aggr; // members aggr.i, agrr.f are not initialized
  Aggregate aggrArray[2]; // members of each element are not initialized
}
----

Finally, allocating objects of builtin or such aggregates types on the heap,
also does not initialize their values:

[source,c]
----
void usingMalloc() {
  int* intArr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 10); // each of 10 allocated integers is not initialized
}
----

This also applies when `new` is used in {cpp}:

[source,cpp]
----
void usingNew() {
  Aggregate* aggrPtr = new Aggregate; // members of allocated Aggregate are not initialized
  Aggregate* aggrArr = new Aggregate[5]; // members of each of 5 Aggregate objects are not initialized
}
----


=== What is the potential impact?

include::../../../shared_content/cfamily/garbage_value_impact.adoc[]

=== Why is there an issue for a class with a default constructor?

In {cpp}, a class can define a default constructor invoked when an
object of the given type is created. Such a constructor is called even
if a variable is declared without any initializer.
However, if the constructor code omits the initialization
of a member that itself does not have the default constructor,
the member will remain uninitialized  (See also S2107). And reading
from it will produce a garbage value:

[source,cpp]
----
struct Partial {
  // x is not initialized
  Partial() : y(10.0) {}

  int x;
  float y;
};

int initialized() {
  Partial p; // constructor is called
  // or even Partial p{};
  return p.x; // Non-compliant: reading an uninitialized variable
}
----


=== Exceptions

This rule does not flag the variables with static storage duration, meaning:
global, static, and thread-local variables.

All the variables with static storage duration are zero-initialized before the initializer is evaluated.
As a consequence, any variable or member of such an object has a defined value even if no initializer is specified.

[source,cpp]
----
int globInt;
int globTab[10];
Aggregate globAggr;
Partial globPart; // x member is zero-initialized

int uses() {
  static int staticInt;
  return globInt     // Compliant: all zero-initialized
       + globTab[2]
       + globAggr.f
       + globPart.x
       + staticInt;
}
----

== How to fix it

Commonly, the use of an uninitialized object is an indication of a defect in the
code, where either variable initialization was skipped on some code paths, or
the object is used by mistake. Generally, you can address such problems by:

* Initializing variables on the declaration with a valid value
* Assigning to the variable on the code path(s) that was missing initialization

Whenever possible, it is preferable to initialize a variable with its final
value on the declaration, as this eliminates the possibility of this defect
occurring.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int a;
  if (flag) {
    a = b;
  }
  return a; // Noncompliant: "a" has not been initialized in all paths
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Initializing variable on all code paths:

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int a;
  if (flag) {
    a = b;
  } else {
    a = 10;
  }
  return a; // Compliant
}
----

Skipping path that leads to the read of an uninitialized value:

[source,c]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int a;
  if (flag) {
    a = b;
  } else {
    return 10;
  }
  return a; // Compliant
}
----

Providing a valid initial value:

[source,cpp]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int a = 10;
  if (flag) {
    a = b;
  }
  return a; // Compliant
}
----

Initializing value in the definition:

[source,c]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int const a = flag ? b : 10;
  return a; // Compliant
}
----

=== Pitfalls

Initializing the variable to zero at the declaration is not always the right
solution to fix the issue, as it may lead to logic errors if such a value
is not handled correctly. For example, setting an `age` field of an `Employee`
structure may break assumptions of retirement handling code. Or more commonly,
setting a pointer to `NULL` will turn dereference of an uninitialized value
into a null-pointer dereference.


=== Going the extra mile

With the addition of lambdas in {cpp}11, it is possible to initialize
variables on declaration without creating a separate function
to compute the value:

[source,cpp]
----
int x = [&] { // capture all context by reference
  if (someCondition())
    return computeVar1();
  /* perform more computations */
  return other;
}(); // invoke the lambda immediately (right after creation)
----

Such pattern is referred to as an _Immediately invoked function expression_
(IIFE) or _Imediately invoked lambda_.
Furthermore, with the addition of structured binding in {cpp}17, it is
possible to declare multiple variables whose values are coupled:

[source,cpp]
----
auto [px, py, pz] = [&] {
  if (x_dir) {
    return std::make_tuple(1, 0, 0);
  } else if (y_dir) {
    return std::make_tuple(0, 1, 0);
  } else {
    assert(z_dir);
    return std::make_tuple(0, 0, 1);
  }
}();
----
