== Why is this an issue?

Variables should be initialized before their use to avoid unexpected behaviors due to garbage values.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int a;
  if (flag) {
    a = b;
  }
  return a; // Noncompliant - "a" has not been initialized in all paths
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int function(int flag, int b) {
  int a = 0;
  if (flag) {
    a = b;
  }
  return a;
}
----
