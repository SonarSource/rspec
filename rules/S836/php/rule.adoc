In PHP it is not required to initialize variables before their usage. However, using uninitialized variables is considered bad practice and should be avoided because of the following reasons:

* The value and type of uninitialized variables depend on the context of their first usage. It is better to be explicit about those to avoid confusion.
* The interpreter raises a warning or a notice in many cases.

<?php

function getText(array $lines): string {
    foreach ($lines as $line) {
        $text .= $line;
    }

    return $text;
}

== Compliant Solution

----
<?php

function getText(array $lines): string {
    $text = "";

    foreach ($lines as $line) {
        $text .= $line;
    }

    return $text;
}
