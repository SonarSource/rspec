== Why is this an issue?

In PHP it is not required to initialize variables before their usage. However, using uninitialized variables is considered bad practice and should be avoided because of the following reasons:

* The value and type of uninitialized variables depend on the context of their first usage. It is better to be explicit about those to avoid confusion.
* The interpreter raises a warning or a notice in many cases.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
<?php

function getText(array $lines): string {
    foreach ($lines as $line) {
        $text .= $line;
    }

    return $text;
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
<?php

function getText(array $lines): string {
    $text = "";

    foreach ($lines as $line) {
        $text .= $line;
    }

    return $text;
}
