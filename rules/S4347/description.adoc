The `java.security.SecureRandom` class provides a strong random number generator (RNG) appropriate for cryptography. However, seeding it with a constant or another predictable value will weaken it significantly. In general, it is much safer to rely on the seed provided by the `SecureRandom` implementation.


This rule raises an issue when `SecureRandom.setSeed()` or `SecureRandom(byte[])` are called with a seed that is either one of:

* a constant
* the system time
