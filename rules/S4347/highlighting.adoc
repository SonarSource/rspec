=== Highlighting

When the random number generator's output **is not** predictable by default:

* The most recent function call that sets a seed. For example:
  - The factory method that returns the RNG, where the seed is passed as a parameter.
  - The RNG constructor, where the seed is a parameter.
  - The function call on the RNG that sets the seed.

When the random number generator's output **is** predictable by default:

* The function call on the RNG that returns a random value.

If the factory method or constructor is not already highlighted, it should become
a secondary highlight.
