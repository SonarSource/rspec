=== What is the potential impact?
It is crucial to understand that the strength of cryptographic algorithms heavily relies on the quality of the random numbers used. By improperly seeding a CSPRNG, we introduce a significant weakness that can be exploited by attackers.

==== Insecure cryptographic keys
One of the primary use cases for CSPRNGs is generating cryptographic keys. If an attacker can predict the seed used to initialize the random number generator, they may be able to derive the same keys. Depending on the use case, this can lead to multiple severe outcomes, such as:

* Being able to decrypt sensitive documents, leading to privacy breaches or identity theft.
* Gaining access to a private key used for signing, allowing an attacker to forge digital signatures and impersonate legitimate entities.
* Bypassing authentication mechanisms that rely on public-key infrastructure (PKI), which can be abused to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks.

==== Session hijacking and man-in-the-middle attack
Another scenario where this vulnerability can be exploited is in the generation of session tokens or nonces for secure communication protocols. If an attacker can predict the seed used to generate these tokens, they can impersonate legitimate users or intercept sensitive information.
