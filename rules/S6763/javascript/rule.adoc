== Why is this an issue?

In React, a `PureComponent` is a class component that is optimized for performance by implementing a shallow comparison of props and state. It is a subclass of the regular React `Component` class and provides a default implementation of the `shouldComponentUpdate` method.

The `shouldComponentUpdate` method is responsible for determining whether a component should re-render or not. By default, it returns true and triggers a re-render every time the component receives new props or state. However, `PureComponent` overrides this method and performs a shallow comparison of the current and next props and state. If there are no changes, it prevents unnecessary re-renders by returning false.

Therefore, defining a `shouldComponentUpdate` method while extending `PureComponent` is redundant and should be avoided. By not defining `shouldComponentUpdate`, you allow `React.PureComponent` to handle the optimization for you.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent { // Noncompliant
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    // does something
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello!</div>
  }
}
----

You should either remove the redundant method `shouldComponentUpdate` or turn your component into a regular one by extending `Component`.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    // does something
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello!</div>
  }
}
