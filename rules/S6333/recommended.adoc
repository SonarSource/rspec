== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

In general, prefer limiting API access to a specific set of people or entities.

AWS provides multiple methods to do so, whose use changes depending on the
underlying need.

Using "AWS_IAM" uses the IAM service usually used to manage access to AWS
resources directly, such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets.

Using "COGNITO_USER_POOLS" uses AWS's Cognito directory services to manage user
authentication for AWS-independent need, such as user authentication and
authorization for web and mobile applications. +
It is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP). 

Using "CUSTOM" means using a Lambda authorizer, formerly known as a custom
authorizer. It can be used to authorize an API using an external OIDC provider.
