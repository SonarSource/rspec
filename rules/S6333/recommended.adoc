== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

In general, prefer limiting API access to a specific set of people or entities.

AWS provides multiple methods to do so:

* `AWS_IAM`, to use standard AWS IAM roles and policies.
* `COGNITO_USER_POOLS`, to use customizable OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdP).
* `CUSTOM`, to use an AWS-independant OIDC provider, glued to the infrastructure with a Lambda authorizer.
