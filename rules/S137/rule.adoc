== Why is this an issue?

Switch statements should be easy to read and to understand. Writing too many lines of

code in case clauses quickly makes it harder to get the overall behaviour of a switch

statement.


When the number of lines a exceeds specific number, the best option is to extract the 

corresponding code into a new function with a meaningful name.
