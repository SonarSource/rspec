== Why is this an issue?

If a private member of the class is declared but not used in the program, it can be considered dead code and should therefore be removed. This will improve maintainability because developers will not wonder what the variable is used for.

The private class members were introduced in ES2022 and use `#` hash symbol prefix. It is possible to declare private fields, methods, getters and setters as well as their static counterparts.

Private class members that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most likely an error due to incomplete refactoring and should be corrected or removed.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass {
    #privateField1;
    #privateField2;  // Noncompliant, #privateField2 is unused
    #privateMethod(){} // Noncompliant, #privateMethod is unused
    publicMethod(){
        return this.#privateField1;
    }
}
----

To fix the code remove unused private member of the class.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass {
    #privateField1;
    publicMethod(){
        return this.#privateField1;
    }
}
