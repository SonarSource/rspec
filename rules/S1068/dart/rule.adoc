== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

[source,dart]
----
class MyClass {
  final String _str; // Noncompliant, _str private field is never read

  C(this._str);
}
----

The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `_originalValue` isn't read anywhere in the library:

[source,dart]
----
class MyClass {
  final String _originalValue;
  final String _currentValue;

  C(this._originalValue) : _currentValue = _originalValue;

  String get value => _currentValue;

}
----

It might appear that the field `_originalValue` is being read in the initializer `(_currentValue = _originalValue)`, but that is actually a reference to the parameter of the same name, not a reference to the field.

== How t fix it?

If the field isn't needed, then remove it.

If the field was intended to be used, then add the missing code.
