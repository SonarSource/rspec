== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

[source,dart]
----
class MyClass {
  final String _str; // Noncompliant, _str private field is never read

  C(this._str);
}
----

== How to fix it

If the field isn't needed, then remove it.

If the field was intended to be used, then add the missing code.
