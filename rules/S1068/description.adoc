If a `private` field is declared but not used locally, its limited visibility makes it dead code.

This is either the sign that some logic is missing that should use this field or that the code should be cleaned.

Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand and preventing bugs from being introduced.
