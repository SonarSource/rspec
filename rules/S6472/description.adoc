Using ENV to handle secrets can lead to sensitive information being disclosed
to an inappropriate sphere.

The `ENV` commands in a Dockerfile are used to configure the container
environment. The variables set that way can be used at image build time,
during the execution of commands in the container, or at run time.

In most cases, environment variables are used to propagate configuration items
from the host to the container. A typical example is the `PATH` variable, used
to configure where system executables are searched for.

Using `ENV` to propagate configuration entries that contain secrets causes a
security risk. Indeed, in most cases, artifacts of those values are kept in the
final container image and, thus, disclosed to its users. The secret information
leak can happen either in the container environment itself, the image
metadata or the build environment logs.

The concrete impact of such an issue highly depends on the secret's purpose and
the exposure sphere:

* Financial impact if a paid service API key is disclosed and used.
* Application compromise if an application's secret, like a session signing
key, is disclosed.
* Infrastructure component takeover, if a system secret, like a remote access key, is leaked.
