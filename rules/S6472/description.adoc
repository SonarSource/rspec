The `ENV` commands in a Dockerfile are used to configure the container
environment. The variables set that way can be used at image build time,
during the execution of commands in the container, or at run time.

In most cases, environment variables are used to propagate configuration items
from the host to the container. A typical example is the `PATH` variable, used
to configure where system executables are searched for.

Using `ENV` to propagate configuration entries that contain secrets causes a
security risk. Indeed, in most cases, artifacts of those values are kept in the
final container image and, thus, disclosed to its users. The secret information
leak can happen either in the container environment itself or in the image
metadata.
