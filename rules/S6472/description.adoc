Using `ENV` and `ARG` to handle secrets can lead to sensitive information being
disclosed
to an inappropriate sphere.

The `ARG` and `ENV` instructions in a Dockerfile are used to configure the image
build and the container environment respectively. Both can be used at image
build time,
during the execution of commands in the container, and `ENV` can also be used
at runtime.

In most cases, build-time and environment variables are used to propagate
configuration items
from the host to the image or container. A typical example for an environmental
variable is the `PATH` variable, used
to configure where system executables are searched for.

Using `ARG` and `ENV` to propagate configuration entries that contain secrets
causes a
security risk. Indeed, in most cases, artifacts of those values are kept in the
final image. The secret information
leak can happen either in the container environment itself, the image
metadata or the build environment logs.

The concrete impact of such an issue highly depends on the secret's purpose and
the exposure sphere:

* Financial impact if a paid service API key is disclosed and used.
* Application compromise if an application's secret, like a session signing
key, is disclosed.
* Infrastructure component takeover, if a system secret, like a remote access
key, is leaked.
