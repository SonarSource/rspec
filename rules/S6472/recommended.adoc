== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use Buildkit's secret mount options when secrets have to be used at build
time.
* For run time secret variables, best practices would recommend only setting
them at runtime, for example with the `--env` option of the `docker run` command.

Note that, in both cases, the files exposing the secrets should be securely
stored and not exposed to a large sphere. In most cases, using a secret vault or
another similar component should be preferred. For example, *Docker Swarm*
provides a *secrets* service that can be used to handle most confidential data.
