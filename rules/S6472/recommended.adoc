== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use Buildkit's secret mount options when secrets have to be used at build
time.
* When Buildkit is not available, use a multi-step build configuration and only
expose secret variables in the intermediate steps.
* For run time secret variables, best practices would recommend only setting
them at runtime, for example with the `--env` option of the `docker run` command.
