== Why is this an issue?

Most developers expect property access to be as efficient as field access. However, if a property returns a copy of an array or collection, it will be much slower than a simple field access, contrary to the caller's likely expectations. Therefore, such properties should be refactored into methods so that callers are not surprised by the unexpectedly poor performance.
