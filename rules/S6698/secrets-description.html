<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Passwords in PostgreSQL are used to authenticate users against the database
engine. They are associated with user accounts that are granted specific
permissions over the database and its hosted data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a PostgreSQL password leaks to an unintended audience, it can have serious
consequences for the security of your database, the data stored within it, and
the applications that rely on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_data">Compromise of sensitive data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the affected service is used to store or process personally identifiable
information or other sensitive data, attackers knowing an authentication secret
could be able to access it. Depending on the type of data that is compromised,
it could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or other
negative outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a
reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_security_downgrade">Security downgrade</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications relying on a PostgreSQL database instance can suffer a security
downgrade if an access password is leaked to attackers. Depending on the
purposes the application uses the database for, consequences can range from
low-severity issues, like defacement, to complete compromise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if the PostgreSQL instance is used as part of the authentication
process of an application, attackers with access to the database will likely be
able to bypass this security mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, no connection information is logged by PostgreSQL server. The
<code>log_connections</code> parameter must be set to <code>true</code> in the server configuration
for this to happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Never hard-code secrets, not even the default values</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important that you do not hard-code secrets, even default values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, hard-coded default secrets are often short and can be easily compromised
even by attackers who do not have access to the code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, hard-coded default secrets can cause problems if they need to be
changed or replaced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And most importantly, there is always the possibility to accidentally set
default secrets for production services, which can lead to security
vulnerabilities and make production insecure by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To minimize these risks, it is recommended to apply the above strategies, even
for the default settings.</p>
