<p>Deserializing objects is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10654">CVE-2018-10654</a>: Hazelcast Library: Java deserialization vulnerability</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000058">CVE-2018-1000058</a>: Jenkins Pipeline: arbitrary code execution vulnerability</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Object deserialization from an untrusted source can lead to unexpected code execution. <code>ObjectInputStream</code> doesn&#8217;t provide a way to apply rules on its <code>InputStream</code> argument. Knowing that all serializable classes in the scope of the classloader will be deserialized, there is a possibility that malicious code could be executed during the deserialization phase even if, in the end, a <code>ClassCastException</code> will be raised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deserialization takes a stream of bits and turns it into an object. If the stream contains the type of object you expect, all is well. But if you&#8217;re deserializing untrusted input, and an attacker has inserted some other type of object, you&#8217;re in trouble. Why? There are a few different attack scenarios, but one widely-documented one goes like this: Deserialization first instantiates an <code>Object</code>, then uses the  <code>readObject</code> method to populate it. If the attacker has overridden <code>readObject</code> then he is entirely in control of what code executes during that process. It is only after <code>readObject</code> has completed that your newly-minted <code>Object</code> can be cast to the type you expected. A <code>ClassCastException</code> or <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> will be thrown, but at that point it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<li>
<p>an attacker could have tampered with the source provided to the deserialization function.</p>

<p>you are using an unsafe deserialization function. See the <strong>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</strong> for examples of safe libraries.</p>

<h2 id="_recommended_secure_coding_practices">Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To prevent insecure deserialization, you should either use look-ahead deserialization (pre-Java 9) or a filter to make sure you&#8217;re dealing with the correct type of object <em>before</em> you act on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several third-party libraries offer look-ahead deserialization, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ikkisoft&#8217;s <code>SerialKiller</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apache Commons Class IO&#8217;s <code>ValidatingObjectInputStream</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contrast-rO0&#8217;s <code>SafeObjectInputStream</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that it is possible to set a deserialization filter at the level of the JVM, but relying on that requires that your environment be configured perfectly. Every time. Additionally, such a filter may have unwanted impacts on other applications in the environment. On the other hand, setting a filter as close as possible to the deserialization that uses it allows you to specify a very narrow, focused filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should also limit access to the serialized source. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>if it is a file, restrict the access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it comes from the network, restrict who has access to the process, such as with a Firewall or by authenticating the sender first.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>\[~freddy.mallet] I agree the main problem here is the "Insecure Deserialization" that can lead to a potential "Injection". The "Injection" can&#8217;t be performed easily, you need first to bypass the deserialization layer. So I removed OWASP A1.</p>

<p>\[~andrei.epure] Hotspots rules are going to be revisited with "recommendations" that a Security Auditors should follow to be sure the code is safe. This <code>setObjectInputFilter]} will be part of them. Here we just want to raise a simple issue when the {{readObject</code> is called. Then up to the Security Auditor to look around this code and see if some sanitization of in the input is made.</p>
