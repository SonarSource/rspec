Thanks [~SPoint] ! And I would even remove the A1 category [~alexandre.gigleux] to keep our referential orthogonal.

\[~freddy.mallet] I agree the main problem here is the "Insecure Deserialization" that can lead to a potential "Injection". The "Injection" can't be performed easily, you need first to bypass the deserialization layer. So I removed OWASP A1.

\[~andrei.epure] Hotspots rules are going to be revisited with "recommendations" that a Security Auditors should follow to be sure the code is safe. This ``++setObjectInputFilter]} will be part of them. Here we just want to raise a simple issue when the {{readObject++`` is called. Then up to the Security Auditor to look around this code and see if some sanitization of in the input is made.
