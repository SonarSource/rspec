Granting privileges to make significant changes to internal resources can allow
attackers to attack, steal, and persist in an organization's cloud resources.

The goal of this rule is to communicate that attackers must be considered as
knowledgeable as an organization's own technicians. Today, operations teams
need to know about two important scenarios that can occur.

The first scenario is that attackers may need to deploy new resources to
execute their malicious intent or stay within the infrastructure. Therefore,
operations teams need to control what unexpectedly appears in the
infrastructure, e.g., what

* is added,
* is written down,
* updated,
* is started,
* appended,
* applied,
* and what is accessed.

The second scenario intervenes once the malicious intent has been executed. At
this stage, the attackers must either persist or remove their fingerprints.
When attacks are detected by the organization, security investigations must
verify what may have disappeared from the infrastructure, e.g., what

* has been stopped,
* has been disabled,
* has been canceled,
* has been deleted,
* destroyed,
* detached,
* disconnected,
* suspended,
* rejected,
* or removed.

Note: In the event of a security incident, restrictive measures like the
previous ones are absolutely not recommended for the operations team trying to
stop the attack. Attackers might notice the deletion and know that an
investigation is underway.

To prevent improper creation or deletion of resources, proactive measures
include restricting upstream custom roles.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* This custom role will only be used for read purposes
* Compliance policies require that access should be read-only

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Replace this set of permissions with as much read-only permissions as possible.

== Sensitive Code Example

=== Message

Replace this set of permissions with as many read-only permissions as possible.

Review these permissions to make sure read-only is more appropriate or not.
Make sure that this role really needs these permissions
