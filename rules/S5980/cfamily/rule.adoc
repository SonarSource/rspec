Multiple smart pointers should not be initialized with pointers pointing to the same memory. Smart pointers take care of calling the object deleter; this means that two smart pointers initialized with the same raw pointer value would lead to calling the delete function twice on the same address.Â Double deleting is a recipe for undefined behavior.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void fshared_ptr() {
  int* p = new int;
  std::shared_ptr<int> p1(p);
  std::shared_ptr<int> p2(p); // Noncompliant, memory deleted twice
}

void funique_ptr(int* p1) {
  std::unique_ptr<int> p2(p1); // Noncompliant, memory deleted twice
}

void f() {
  auto up = std::make_unique<int>(10);
  funique_ptr(up.get());
}
