== Why is this an issue?

In Kotlin, nullability is a part of the type system. This means that all types could be used in 2 ways. T - as non-nullable and T? as nullable. When you want to access properties or instance methods of a nullable type, you need to handle the potential null value. 

However, while accessing a non-nullable type, you don't need to test nullability as the compiler knows that the value can never be null. So all the nullability checks on the non-nullable types are considered code smells.


Here is an example of non-nullable variable. 's' is of a type string and cannot be null.

[source, kotlin]
----
val s: String = ""
----

Here is an example of nullable variable. Nullable variables are declared by using the '?' operator.

[source, kotlin]
----
val s?: String = ""
----


== How to fix it

Avoid using null checks on non-nullable variables.

=== Code examples

If your variable type is declared as a String, it will be non-nullable. All of the null checks listed below are redundant, and only add unneeded complexity to your code.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source, kotlin]
----
val s: String = ""

if (s == null) {} // Noncompliant, always false
if (s != null) {} // Noncompliant, always true
s?.doSomething() // Noncompliant, useless ?.
s ?: return "" // Noncompliant, useless ?:
requireNotNull(s) // Noncompliant, always pass
checkNotNull(s) // Noncompliant, always pass
s!!.doSomething() // Noncompliant, useless !!
----

==== Compliant solution

[source, kotlin]
----
val s: String = ""
----
