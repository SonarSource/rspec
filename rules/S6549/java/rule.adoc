== Why is this an issue?

Applications behave as filesystem oracles when they disclose to attackers if resources from the filesystem exist or not.

A user with malicious intent would inject specially crafted values, such as ``++../++``, to change the initially intended path. The resulting path would resolve to a location somewhere in the filesystem which the user should not normally have access to.


=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker exploiting a filesystem oracle vulnerability can determine if a file exists or not.

The files that can be affected are limited by the permission of the process
that runs the application. Worst case scenario: the process runs with elevated privileges, and therefore any file can be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Information gathering

The vulnerability is exploited to gather information about the host system. The filesystem oracle can help identify user accounts, running services, or the exact version of installed software.
