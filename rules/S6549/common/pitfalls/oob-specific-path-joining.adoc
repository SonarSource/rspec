==== Do not use {joining_func} as a validator

As specified in the {joining_docs}[official documentation], if the given
parameter is an absolute path, the base object from which the method is called
is discarded and is not included in the resulting string.

This means that including untrusted data in the parameter and using the
resulting string for file operations may lead to a path traversal vulnerability.
