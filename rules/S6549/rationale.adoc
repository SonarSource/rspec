Applications behave as filesystem oracles when they disclose to attackers if resources from the filesystem exist or not.

A user with malicious intent would inject specially crafted values, such as ``++../++``, to change the initial intended path. The resulting path would resolve somewhere in the filesystem where the user should not normally have access to.
