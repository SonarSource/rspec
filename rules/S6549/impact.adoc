=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker exploiting a filesystem oracle vulnerability can determine if a file exists or not.

The files that can be affected are limited by the permission of the process
that runs the application. Worst case scenario: the process runs with elevated privileges, and therefore any file can be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Information gathering

The vulnerability is exploited to gather information about the host system. The filesystem oracle can help identify user accounts, running services, or the exact version of installed software.
