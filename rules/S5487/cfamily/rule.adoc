Failing to properly initialize or destroy a `pthread` mutex can lead to undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

_Mutexes_ are synchronization primitives that allow managing concurrency.

Their use requires following a well-defined life cycle:

* _Mutexes_ need to be initialized (using ``++pthread_mutex_init++``) before being used. Once it is initialized, a _mutex_ is in an _unlocked_ state.
* _Mutexes_ need to be destroyed (using ``++pthread_mutex_destroy++``) to free the associated internal resources. Only _unlocked_ _mutexes_ can be safely destroyed.

Before initialization and after destruction, a mutex is in an uninitialized state.

During a _mutex_' life cycle,
the following patterns should be avoided as they result in undefined behavior:

* trying to initialize an already initialized _mutex_
* trying to destroy an initialized _mutex_ that is in a _locked_ state
* trying to destroy an uninitialized _mutex_
* trying to lock an uninitialized _mutex_
* trying to unlock an uninitialized _mutex_

In {cpp}11 and higher, `std::mutex` is less error-prone and is supported by more platforms.

In {cpp}03, it is recommended to wrap mutex creation/destruction in an RAII class, as well as mutex lock/unlock. Those RAII classes will perform the right operations, even in the presence of exceptions.

=== What is the potential impact?

Failing to properly initialize or destroy a POSIX Thread Mutex leads to *undefined behavior*.

For programs that exercise undefined behavior, the compiler is no longer bound by the language specification.
The application may crash or, even worse, the application may appear to execute correctly while losing data or producing incorrect results.
In a multi-threaded context, additionally, the application may experience spurious deadlocks or data races.


== How to fix it

Ensure that all mutexes follow the well-defined life cycle.

If {cpp}11 (or higher) is available, use `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard`, instead, to avoid invalid usage patterns that lead to undefined behavior.
Depending on the scenario, `std::atomic` may be used as an alternative if only small and primitive data shall be modified in a concurrent context and in a synchronized manner.


=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t mtx;

void double_initialization(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL); // Initializes the mutex using an implementation-defined default attribute.
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL); // Noncompliant: initializing an already initialized mutex
}

void destroy_locked(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx); // Noncompliant: destroying a locked mutex
}

void double_destruction(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx); // Noncompliant: destroying an uninitialized mutex
}

void lock_destroyed(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx); // Noncompliant: locking an uninitialized mutex
}

void unlock_destroyed(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx);
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx); // Noncompliant: unlocking an uninitialized mutex
}
----


==== Compliant solution

C solution:

[source,c]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t mtx;

void destroy_initialized(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx);
}

void use_and_destroy_initialized(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx);
  // Critical code that processes a shared resource (e.g. memory).
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx);
  pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx);
}
----

For static mutex variables:

[source,c]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t mtx = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void use_statically_initialized(void)
{
  pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx); // Compliant: mutex is initialized statically
  // Critical code that processes a shared resource (e.g. memory).
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx);
}
----

{cpp}11 and higher solution:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <mutex>
#include <stdexcept>

std::mutex mtx;

void use_lock_guard(bool condition) {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
  // Critical code that processes a shared resource (e.g. memory).
  if (condition) {
    // Compliant: mutex will unlock automatically even in case of an exception
    throw std::invalid_argument("Expected false");
  }
  // Compliant: mutex will unlock automatically at the end of the scope
}
----

{cpp}03 solution:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t mtx;

class Mutex {
public:
  Mutex(pthread_mutex_t* mtx) : pmtx(mtx) {
    pthread_mutex_init(pmtx, /*mutex attribute=*/NULL);
  }
  ~Mutex() {
    pthread_mutex_destroy(pmtx);
  }
  pthread_mutex_t* pmtx;
private:
  // Disallow copy operations to avoid double-free issues.
  Mutex(Mutex const& other);
  Mutex& operator=(Mutex const& other);
};

struct LockGuard {
  LockGuard(Mutex &m) : mtx(m) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mtx.pmtx);
  }
  ~LockGuard() {
    pthread_mutex_unlock(mtx.pmtx);
  }
  Mutex &mtx;
};

void destroy_initialized()
{
  Mutex m(&mtx);
  // Compliant: mtx will be properly initialized and destroyed
}

void use_and_destroy_initialized()
{
  Mutex m(&mtx);
  {
    LockGuard lock(m);
    // Critical code that processes a shared resource (e.g. memory).
    // Compliant: mutex will unlock automatically at the end of the scope
  }
  // Compliant: mtx will be destroyed properly
}

"Going the extra mile" could explain how the modern ({cpp}17, {cpp}20) std::locks are implemented so that people could reimplement them in {cpp}11 if necessary.
