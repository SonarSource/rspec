We drop the substitutions regarding the Optional class, since the rule is about Functional Interfaces and they make the rule much more complicated.

We are going to create a new rule to make the underline substitutions possible:

|``++Optional<Integer>++`` | ``++OptionalInt++``|

|``++Optional<Long>++`` | ``++OptionalLong++``|

|``++Optional<Double>++`` | ``++OptionalDouble++``|

\[~stylianos.agapiou] Did you create RSPEC for the new rule about ``++Optional++``? If not, can you start a discussion about this rule? If yes, can you link the new rule here?

\[~tibor.blenessy] No, I didn't create an RSPEC for the rule. I will start a discussion about it. Thanks for the notice.
