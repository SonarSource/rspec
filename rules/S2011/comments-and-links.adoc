@Ann, I would have associated this rule to the "Reliability" SQALE characteristic. I'm using the "Changeability - Data related changeability" mainly when a design flaw may prevent the developer from changing a structure of data.

This rule should be only about the use of the global keyword. Instead of grabbing value from global scope, fcn should receive it as a parameter

1. I just have a small suggestion for the description, WDYT about something like:


"_{color:grey}Global variables are a useful construct, but they should not be abused{color}_. 

A function can access the global scope through the global keyword.This practice considerably reduces the readability of a function. The global variable should be passed as a parameter of the function."


2. About the tag I agree, convention suits well for me.


3. Also, maybe we could the add in this rule the use of $GLOBALS array, see: \http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONARPHP-131, sorry for realising this only now.

\[~linda.martin] all 3 suggestions taken, but you'll want to double-check my syntax/usage of $GLOBALS in the noncompliant example.
