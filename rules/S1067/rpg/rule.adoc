The complexity of an expression is defined by the number of ``++AND++``, ``++OR++``.

A single expression's complexity should not become too high to keep the code readable.

With the default threshold value of 3

C                   IF        (condition1 AND condition2)
C                             OR (condition2 AND condition2)
C                             OR (condition3 AND condition4)

   IF A=X OR A=Y AND A=Z AND B=Y OR B=Z;
        ...
