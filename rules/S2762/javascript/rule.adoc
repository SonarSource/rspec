jQuery doesn't cache elements for you. If you've made a selection that you might need to make again, you should save the selection in a variable rather than making the selection repeatedly.


== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default threshold of 2

----
$( "p" ).hide();
$( "p" ).show();  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
var paragraph = $( "p" );

paragraph.hide();
paragraph.show();
----


== Exceptions

Stored selections are not updated when the DOM changes. Since variables may need to updated this rule ignores selections that are repeated during an assignment.

----
var paragraph = $("p");

// ...

paragraph = $("p");
----
