Vue.js framework prevents XSS vulnerabilities by automatically escaping HTML contents with the use of native API browsers like ``++innerText++`` instead of ``++innerHtml++``. 

It's still possible to explicity use ``++innerHtml++`` and similar APIs to render HTML. Accidentally rendering malicious HTML data will introduce an XSS vulnerability in the application and enable a wide range of serious attacks like accessing/modifying sensitive information or impersonating other users.


== Ask Yourself Whether

The application needs to render HTML content which:

* could be user-controlled and not previously sanitized.
* is difficult to understand how it was constructed. 

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Avoid injecting HTML content with ``++v-html++`` directive unless the content can be considered 100% safe, instead try to rely as much as possible on built-in auto-escaping Vue.js features.
* Take care when using the ``++v-bind:href++`` directive to set URLs which can contain malicious Javascript (``++javascript:onClick(...)++``).
* Event directives like ``++:onmouseover++`` are also prone to Javascript injection and should not be used with unsafe values.



== Sensitive Code Example

When using Vue.js templates, the ``++v-html++`` directive enables HTML rendering without any sanitization:
----
<div v-html="htmlContent"></div> <!-- Noncompliant -->
----

When using a rendering function, the ``++innerHTML++`` attribute enables HTML rendering without any sanitization:
----
Vue.component('element', {
  render: function (createElement) {
    return createElement(
      'div',
      {
        domProps: {
          innerHTML: this.htmlContent, // Noncompliant
        }
      }
    );
  },
});
----

When using JSX, the ``++domPropsInnerHTML++`` attribute enables HTML rendering without any sanitization:
----
<div domPropsInnerHTML={this.htmlContent}></div> <!-- Noncompliant -->
----

== Compliant Solution

When using Vue.js templates, putting the content as a child node of the element is safe:
----
<div>{{ htmlContent }}</div>
----

When using a rendering function, using the ``++innerText++`` attribute or putting the content as a child node of the element is safe:
----
Vue.component('element', {
  render: function (createElement) {
    return createElement(
      'div',
      {
        domProps: {
          innerText: this.htmlContent, 
        }
      },
      this.htmlContent // Child node
    );
  },
});
----

When using JSX, putting the content as a child node of the element is safe:
----
<div>{this.htmlContent}</div>
