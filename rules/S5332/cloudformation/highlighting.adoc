=== Highlighting

* For AWS Load Balancer Listeners :

** Highlight `Properties.Protocol` and maybe also `FixedResponseConfig.MessageBody` if `fixed-response` is used as a `Rule Action` and if `protocol` is set to `HTTP`
** Highlight `Properties.Protocol` if the Load Balancer is an ALB, and if the protocol is set to `HTTP` if `Forward` is used as a `Rule Action`
** redirect : Highlight `RedirectConfig.Protocol` and `Properties.Protocol` if `RedirectConfig.Protocol` is set as `HTTP` if `Redirect` is used as a `Rule Action`
