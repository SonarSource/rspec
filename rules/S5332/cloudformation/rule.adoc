== Sensitive Code Example

For https://aws.amazon.com/msk/[Amazon MSK] communications between clients and brokers:

----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  MSKCluster:
    Type: 'AWS::MSK::Cluster'
    Properties:
      ClusterName: MSKCluster
      EncryptionInfo:
        EncryptionInTransit:
          ClientBroker: TLS_PLAINTEXT # Sensitive
          InCluster: false # Sensitive
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://aws.amazon.com/msk/[Amazon MSK] communications between clients and brokers, data in transit is encrypted by default, allowing you to omit writing the `EncryptionInTransit` configuration. However, if you need to configure its parameters explicitly, this configuration is compliant:

----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  MSKCluster:
    Type: 'AWS::MSK::Cluster'
    Properties:
      ClusterName: MSKCluster
      EncryptionInfo:
        EncryptionInTransit:
          ClientBroker: TLS
          InCluster: true
