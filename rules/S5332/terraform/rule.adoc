== Noncompliant Code Example

For https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/index.html[Amazon OpenSearch domains]:

----
resource "aws_elasticsearch_domain" "example" {
  domain_name = "example"
  domain_endpoint_options {
    enforce_https = false # Sensitive
  }
  node_to_node_encryption {
    enabled = false # Sensitive
  }
----

For https://aws.amazon.com/msk/[Amazon MSK] communications between clients and brokers:

----
resource "aws_msk_cluster" "sensitive_data_cluster" {
    encryption_info {
        encryption_in_transit {
            client_broker = "TLS_PLAINTEXT" # Sensitive
            in_cluster = false # Sensitive
        }
    }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/index.html[Amazon OpenSearch domains]:

----
resource "aws_elasticsearch_domain" "example" {
  domain_name = "example"
  domain_endpoint_options {
    enforce_https = true
  }
  node_to_node_encryption {
    enabled = true
  }
----
  
For https://aws.amazon.com/msk/[Amazon MSK] communications between clients and brokers, data in transit is encrypted by default, allowing you to omit writing the `encryption_in_transit` configuration. However, if you need to configure it explicitly, this configuration is compliant:

----
resource "aws_msk_cluster" "sensitive_data_cluster" {
    encryption_info {
        encryption_in_transit {
            client_broker = "TLS"
            in_cluster = true
        }
    }
}
