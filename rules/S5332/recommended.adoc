== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use ``++ssh++`` as an alternative to ``++telnet++``
* Use ``++sftp++``, ``++scp++`` or ``++ftps++`` instead of ``++ftp++``
* Use ``++https++`` instead of ``++http++``
* Use ``++SMTP++`` over ``++SSL/TLS++`` or ``++SMTP++`` with ``++STARTTLS++`` instead of clear-text SMTP

It is recommended to secure all transport channels (event local network) as it can take a single non secure connection to compromise an entire application or system.
