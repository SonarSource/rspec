Clear-text protocols such as ``++ftp++``, ``++telnet++`` or  non secure ``++http++`` are lacking encryption of transported data. They are also missing the capability to build an authenticated connection. This mean that any attacker who can sniff traffic from the network can read, modify or corrupt the transported content. These protocol are not secure as they expose applications to a large range of risk:

* Sensitive data exposure
* Traffic redirected  to a malicious endpoint
* Malware infected software update or installer
* Execution of client side code
* Corruption of critical information

Cloud components that run in a logically isolated network should avoid using clear-text protocols whenever it's possible. The main reason for enabling encryption in-transit in such a case is to apply the principle of _defense in depth_. An attacker who would successfully bypass isolation mechanisms or take control of one of the components of the network, would be unable to sniff or temper with the transported if encryption in-transit is enabled.

Note also that using the ``++http++`` protocol is being deprecated by https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http[major web browser].
