Clear-text protocols such as ``++ftp++``, ``++telnet++`` or  non secure ``++http++`` are lacking encryption of transported data. They are also missing the capability to build an authenticated connection. This mean that any attacker who can sniff traffic from the network can read, modify or corrupt the transported content. These protocol are not secure as they expose applications to a large range of risk:

* Sensitive data exposure
* Traffic redirected  to a malicious endpoint
* Malware infected software update or installer
* Execution of client side code
* Corruption of critical information

Even in a context of isolated networks like offline environments or cloud environments, there is a risk of communication being sniffed or tampered with. For example, if an attacker could successfully bypass isolation mechanisms or compromise a component of the network. In such a case, the attacker would use clear-text communications as a lever to exploit a data breach or to compromise other components of the network.
This principle of securing systems by layering security basics is also known as _defense-in-depth_.

Note also that using the ``++http++`` protocol is being deprecated by https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http[major web browser].
