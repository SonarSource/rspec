Clear-text protocols such as ``++ftp++``, ``++telnet++`` or  non-secure ``++http++`` lack encryption of transported data, as well as the capability to build an authenticated connection. 
This means that any attacker able to sniff traffic from the network can read, modify or corrupt the transported content. These protocols are not secure as they expose applications to a large range of risk:

* Sensitive data exposure
* Traffic redirected  to a malicious endpoint
* Malware infected software update or installer
* Execution of client side code
* Corruption of critical information

Even in the context of isolated networks like offline environments or segmented cloud environments, the insider threat exists. Thus, attacks involving communications being sniffed or tampered can still happen.

For example, attackers could successfully compromise prior security layers by :
* Bypassing isolation mechanisms
* Compromising a component of the network
* Getting the credentials of an internal IAM account (either from a service account or an actual person)

In such cases, encrypting communications would prevent attackers from exploiting clear-text communications. This additional protection layer would prevent them from leaking data or compromising other components of the network.
By layering various security practices (segmentation and encryption for example), the application will follow the _defense-in-depth_ principle.

Note also that using the ``++http++`` protocol is being deprecated by https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http[major web browser].
