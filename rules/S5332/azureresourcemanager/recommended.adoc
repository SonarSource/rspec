== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Make application data transit over a secure, authenticated and encrypted protocol like TLS or SSH. Here are a few alternatives to the most common clear-text protocols:
** Use ``++sftp++``, ``++scp++``, or ``++ftps++`` instead of ``++ftp++``.
** Use ``++https++`` instead of ``++http++``.


It is recommended to secure all transport channels, even on local networks, as it can take a single non-secure connection to compromise an entire application or system.
