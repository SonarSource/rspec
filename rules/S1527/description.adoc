The following words may be used as keywords in future evolutions of the language, so using them as identifiers should be avoided to allow an easier adoption of those potential future versions:


* ``++await++``
* ``++class++``
* ``++const++``
* ``++enum++``
* ``++export++``
* ``++extends++``
* ``++implements++``
* ``++import++``
* ``++interface++``
* ``++let++``
* ``++package++``
* ``++private++``
* ``++protected++``
* ``++public++``
* ``++static++``
* ``++super++``
* ``++yield++``

Use of these words as identifiers would produce an error in JavaScript ``++strict++`` mode code.

This list includes keywords that have been adopted by the latest implementations of ECMAScript. We have kept them in the rule because our analyzer runs on legacy JavaScript codebases as well.
