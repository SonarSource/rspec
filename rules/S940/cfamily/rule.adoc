== Why is this an issue?

Attempting to make comparisons between pointers will produce undefined behaviour if the two pointers do not point to the same object.


Note: it is permissible to address the next element beyond the end of an array, but accessing this element is not allowed.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f1 ( )
{
 int32_t a1[ 10 ];
 int32_t a2[ 10 ];
 int32_t * p1 = a1;
 if ( p1 < a2 ) // Non-compliant, p1 and a2 are unrelated
 {
 }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f1 ( )
{
 int32_t a1[ 10 ];
 int32_t * p1 = a1;
 if ( p1 < a1 ) // Compliant, p1 points to an element of a1
 {
 }
}
----
