\[~samuel.mercier] I wonder if the message should include the names of the illegally-compared pointers? I ask this only because it could occur in a "busy" line of code.

E.G.

``++if (a < b && c > d) ++`` where a & b are related, but c & d are not.

\[~ann.campbell.2] For me "!=" is a comparison, so that original title allows "p1 != p2", even if they don't point on the same array, while new one forbids. What about usage of a term from C and {cpp} specification: <, >, +<=+ and >= are collectively called "relational operators", == and != are called "equality operators"?
