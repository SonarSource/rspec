== Why is this an issue?

If ``++Thread.sleep(...)++`` is called when the current thread holds a lock, it could lead to performance and scalability issues, or even worse to deadlocks because the execution of the thread holding the lock is frozen. It's better to call ``++wait(...)++`` on the monitor object to temporarily release the lock and allow other threads to run.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public void doSomething(){
  synchronized(monitor) {
    while(notReady()){
      Thread.sleep(200);
    }
    process();
  }
  ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public void doSomething(){
  synchronized(monitor) {
    while(notReady()){
      monitor.wait(200);
    }
    process();
  }
  ...
}
