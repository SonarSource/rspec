== Why is this an issue?

Any modification a method makes to a function parameter passed by reference will also be made to the original value.
Reason for this is that references have the effect of pointing two variables to the same memory space.

This feature can be difficult to use correctly, particularly if the callee is not expecting a reference.

The improper use of references in function calls can make code less efficient rather than more efficient.

Further, according to the PHP manual:

____
As of PHP 5.3.0, you will get a warning saying that "call-time pass-by-reference" is deprecated... And as of PHP 5.4.0, call-time pass-by-reference was removed, so using it will raise a fatal error.
____

== How to fix it

Refactor your code to not pass a reference as a function parameter.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
