If a pointer to an object is used as an exception, the code that will catch the exception may or may not have to delete the pointed-to object. This is even more complex in the exception case than in classical manual memory management, because of the distance between the ``throw`` statements and the matching ``catch``. 

Throwing by value is just simpler and less error prone.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class E { /* Implementation */};
E globalException;

void fn ( int i )
{ 
  // In this situation, the developer writing the 'catch' has no way to know if the object pointed-to by 
  // the exception should be deleted or not...
  if ( i > 10 ) {
    throw ( &globalException); // Noncompliant, the catch is supposed not to delete the pointer
  }
  else {
    throw (new E ); // Noncompliant, the catch is supposed to delete the pointer
  } 
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class E { /* Implementation */};
E globalException;

void fn ( int i )
{ 
  if ( i > 10 ) {
    throw ( globalException); // Throws a copy of the global variable
  }
  else {
    throw (E{} ); // Throws a new object
  } 
}
