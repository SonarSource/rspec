== Why is this an issue?

If a pointer to an object is used as an exception, the code that will catch the exception may or may not have to delete the pointed-to object. This is even more complex in the exception case than in classical manual memory management, because of the distance between the ``++throw++`` statements and the matching ``++catch++``. 


Throwing by value is just simpler and less error prone.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class E { /* Implementation */};
E globalException;

void fn ( int i )
{ 
  // In this situation, the developer writing the 'catch' has no way to know if the object pointed-to by 
  // the exception should be deleted or not...
  if ( i > 10 ) {
    throw ( &globalException); // Noncompliant, the catch is supposed not to delete the pointer
  }
  else {
    throw (new E ); // Noncompliant, the catch is supposed to delete the pointer
  } 
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class E { /* Implementation */};
E globalException;

void fn ( int i )
{ 
  if ( i > 10 ) {
    throw ( globalException); // Throws a copy of the global variable
  }
  else {
    throw (E{} ); // Throws a new object
  } 
}

\[~samuel.mercier] please correct the following

Also [~samuel.mercier] I don't think Maintainability is appropriate here. The risks are 

* both caller and callee destroy the object - undefined behavior (likely runtime crash)
* neither caller nor callee destroys the object - memory leak
Since the worse outcome is a crash, I would associate this to Reliability

And if this is associated to the Reliability category, then the tag 'pitfall' should be replaced by 'bug'

\[~ann.campbell.2] caller cannot destroys the object, unless it also catches the exception it has thrown. But I agree about the memory leak, so I updated to Reliablity / Exception handling

It was on purpose [~evgeny.mandrikov], since this strikes me as potentially an issue of house style. If you think it is not, feel free to set it on by default.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I don't see any valid reason for catching/throwing an exception by pointer, , while opposite is highly recommended, so don't see any reason to not activate this rule by default.
