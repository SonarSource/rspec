== Why is this an issue?

If the ``++'++``, ``++\++``, ``++"++`` or ``++/*++`` characters are used between ``++<++`` and ``++>++`` delimiters or the ``++'++``, ``++\++`` or ``++/*++`` characters are used between the ``++"++`` delimiters in a header name preprocessing token, then the behavior is undefined.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <"foo">     // Noncompliant
#include "dir\foo.h" // Noncompliant
----
