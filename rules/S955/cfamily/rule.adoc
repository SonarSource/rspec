== Why is this an issue?

The `#include` directive allows you to include header files in your code by enclosing the file names in either double quotes (`"`) or angle brackets (`<` and `>`). However, using:

* `'`, `\` or `/*` characters between the double quotes (for example: `#include "dir\foo.h"`)
* `'`, `\`, `"` or `/*` characters between the angle brackets (for example: `#include <"foo">`)

in the header names may or may not be supported, and the behavior will depend on the specific implementation.

== Resources

* MISRA C:2004, 19.2 - Non-standard characters should not occur in header file names in #include directives.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 16-2-4 - The ', ", /* or // characters shall not occur in a header file name.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 16-2-5 - The \ character should not occur in a header file name.
* MISRA C:2012, 20.2 - The ', " or \ characters and the /* or // character sequences shall not occur in a header file name
