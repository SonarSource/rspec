== Why is this an issue?

Type assertion can be done in two ways: with ``++as MyType++`` or with ``++<MyType>++``. But since there is an ambiguity in the latter when using JSX and there is no ambiguity in the former, ``++as++`` is preferred.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
var foo = <any>"foo";  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
var foo = "foo" as any;
