== Why is this an issue?

This rule is not really a rule, but a demonstration of the images that can
appear in a rule description.

=== What is the potential impact?

There are two AsciiDoc image macro types, block and inline. As with all macros,
the block and inline forms differ by the number of colons that follow the macro
name. The block form uses two colons (::), whereas the inline form only uses
one (:).

==== Block image macro

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[Link to that section].

A block image is displayed as a discrete element, i.e., on its own line, in a
document. A block image is designated by image macro name and followed by two
colons (::) It’s preceded by an empty line, entered on a line by itself, and
then followed by an empty line.

----
// Example 1

Content in document.

image::image.png[]  

Content in document
----

To insert a block image, type the image macro name directly followed by two
colons (``++::++``).

After the colons, enter the image file target. Type a pair of square brackets
(``++[]++``) directly after the target to complete the macro.

The result of Example 1 is displayed below.

Content in document

image::image.png[]

Content in document


The target is required. The target may be a relative path or a URL. How the
target is interpreted depends on the processor settings and/or output format.
If the converter generates output that references the image, the path must be
relative to the published document. If the converter embeds the image in the
output document (e.g., inline SVG, data-uri is set, converting to PDF
directly), the target must be resolvable at convert time. In the latter case, a
URL will only be resolved if the security settings on the processor allows it
(e.g., allow-uri-read).

The target may contain space characters. In the HTML output, these spaces will
be URL encoded (i.e., ``++%20++``).

You can specify a comma-separated list of optional attributes inside the square
brackets or leave them empty. If you want to specify alt text, enter it inside
the square brackets.

----
// Example 2. Block image macro with alt text

image::image.png[Image Alt-text]
----

If the alt text contains a comma, you must enclose the alt text in double
quotes. The double quote enclosure effectively escapes the comma from being
interpreted as an attribute separator.

----
// Example 3. Block image macro with alt text that contains a comma
image::sunset.jpg["Mesa Verde Sunset, by JAVH"]
----


Although you could enclose the alt text in single quotes to escape the comma,
doing so implicitly enables substitutions. Unless you need substitutions to be
applied to the alt text, prefer using double quotes as the enclosure.

You can also give the image an ID, title, set its dimensions and make it a
link.

----
// Example 4. Block image macro with attribute list
.A mountain sunset  //1
[#img-sunset,link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/javh/5448336655] // 2
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,200,100] // 3 & 4
----

1 - Defines the title of the block image, which gets displayed underneath the
image when rendered. +
2 - Assigns an ID to the block and makes the image a link. The link attribute
can also be defined inside the attribute list of the block macro. +
3 - The first positional attribute, Sunset, is the image’s alt text. +
4 - The second and third positional attributes define the width and height,
respectively.

The result of Example 4 is displayed below.

.A mountain sunset
[#img-sunset,link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/javh/5448336655]
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,200,100]

==== Figure caption label

When a title is defined on a block image, the image title will be prefixed by a
caption label (Figure) and numbered automatically. To turn off figure caption
labels and numbers, unset the figure-caption attribute in the document header.

= Document Title
:figure-caption!:
Inline image macro
An inline image is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a paragraph or sidebar block. The inline image macro is almost identical to the block image macro, except its macro name is followed by a single colon (:).

Example 5. Inline image macro
Click image:play.png[] to get the party started. 

Click image:pause.png[title=Pause] when you need a break. 
In the flow of an element, enter the macro name and a single colon (image:), followed by the image target. Complete the macro with a pair of square brackets ([]).
You can specify a comma-separated list of attributes inside the square brackets or leave them empty.
The result of Example 5 is displayed below.

Click play to get the party started.

Click pause when you need a break.

The target is required. The target may be a relative path or a URL. How the target is interpreted depends on the processor settings and/or output format. If the converter generates output that references the image, the path must be relative to the published document. If the converter embeds the image in the output document (e.g., inline SVG, data-uri is set, converting to PDF directly), the target must be resolvable at convert time. In the latter case, a URL will only be resolved if the security settings on the processor allows it (e.g., allow-uri-read).

The target may contain space characters. In the HTML output, these spaces will be URL encoded (i.e., %20).

For inline images, the optional title is displayed as a tooltip.
==== Image position

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/image-position/

This image is retrieved from a url with `[BlogPost image, 250, 350]`:

image::https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com/c196a450-1482-01db-440a-964b8358d017/fd9c3f5b-9e7c-43e7-81a3-dd9ed735e48e/java-jdk-21-lts_blog-index.webp[BlogPost image, 250, 350]

This image is an svg with `[Image,200,200,align="center"]`:

image::icon.svg[Image,200,200,align="center"]

Inline with Text: The image is placed directly in line with the text. The top
and bottom of the image will align with the text line. Here it is, retrieved
from a URL , with `[Blogpost image, 25, 25]`:
image:https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com/c196a450-1482-01db-440a-964b8358d017/fd9c3f5b-9e7c-43e7-81a3-dd9ed735e48e/java-jdk-21-lts_blog-index.webp[Blogpost image, 25, 25]
and this is some other text.

Here’s an example of a floating block image. The paragraphs or other blocks
that follow the image will float up into the available space next to the image.
The image will also be positioned horizontally in the center of the image
block.

Example 1. A block image pulled to the right and centered within the block (`[Image,200,200,float="right",align="center"]`)

image::image.png[Image,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed maximus ut est nec
porttitor. Vestibulum nec blandit felis. Duis euismod ac nulla nec tempus.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac
turpis egestas. Suspendisse dapibus metus metus, ut scelerisque quam posuere
nec. Mauris vitae auctor magna. Fusce feugiat sollicitudin ornare. 


Here’s an example of a floating inline image. The image will float into the upper-right corner of the paragraph text (`[Linux,150,150,float="right"]`).

Example 2. An inline image pulled to the right of the paragraph text

image:image.png[Linux,150,150,float="right"]
You can find Linux everywhere these days!


==== Framing roles

image:image.png[role="related thumb right"] Here's text that will wrap around the image to the left.

==== Control the float

When you start floating images, you may discover that too much content is
floating around the image. What you need is a way to clear the float. That is
provided using another role, float-group.

Let’s assume that we’ve floated two images so that they are positioned next to
each other and we want the next paragraph to appear below them.

==== Control the float 1

----
[.left]
.Image A
image::a.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::b.png[B,240,180,title=Image B]

Text below images.
----

[.left]
.Image A
image::image.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::icon.svg[B,240,180,title=Image B]

Text below images.

==== Sample text

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed maximus ut est nec
porttitor. Vestibulum nec blandit felis. Duis euismod ac nulla nec tempus.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac
turpis egestas. Suspendisse dapibus metus metus, ut scelerisque quam posuere
nec. Mauris vitae auctor magna. Fusce feugiat sollicitudin ornare. 

==== Control the float 2

When this example is converted, then viewed in a browser, the paragraph text
appears to the right of the images. To fix this behavior, you just need to
“group” the images together in a block with self-contained floats. Here’s how
it’s done:

----
[.float-group]
--
[.left]
.Image A
image::a.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::b.png[B,240,180]
--

Text below images.
----


[.float-group]
--
[.left]
.Image A
image::image.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::icon.svg[B,240,180]
--

Text below images.

This time, the text will appear below the images where we want it.

==== Demonstration of option values for SVG images

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/image-svg/#options-for-svg-images

image::icon.svg[Static,300]
Observe that the SVG does not respond to the hover event.

image::icon.svg[Interactive,300,opts=interactive]

Observe that the color changes when hovering over the SVG.

image::icon.svg[Embedded,300,opts=inline]

Observe that the color changes when hovering over the SVG. The SVG also inherits CSS from the document stylesheets.

==== Positioning roles
Here are the examples from above, now configured to use roles that map to CSS classes in the default Asciidoctor stylesheet:

Example 3. Block image macro using positioning roles

[.right.text-center]
image::image.png[Tiger,200,200]

Example 4. Inline image macro using positioning role

image:image.png[Sunset,150,150,role=right] What a beautiful sunset!


The following table lists all the roles available out of the box for positioning images.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/image-position/#positioning-roles


Merely setting the float direction on an image is not sufficient for proper
positioning. That’s because, by default, no space is left between the image and
the text. To alleviate this problem, we’ve added sensible margins to images
that use either the positioning named attributes or roles.

If you want to customize the image styles, perhaps to customize the margins,
you can provide your own additions to the stylesheet (either by using your own
stylesheet that builds on the default stylesheet or by adding the styles to a
docinfo file).
