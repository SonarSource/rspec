=== What is the potential impact?

A Google client OAuth secret is a confidential string that is used to
authenticate and authorize applications when they interact with Google APIs. It
is a part of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows applications to access user
data on their behalf.

The client secret is used in the OAuth flow to verify the identity of the
application and ensure that only authorized applications can access user data.
It is typically used in combination with a client ID, which identifies the
application itself.

If a Google client OAuth secret leaks to an unintended audience, it can have
serious security implications. Attackers who obtain the client secret can use it
to impersonate the application and gain unauthorized access to user data.
They can potentially access sensitive information, modify data, or perform
actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

The exact capabilities of the attackers will depend on the authorizations the
corresponding application has been granted.
