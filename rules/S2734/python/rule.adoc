By contract, every Python function returns something, even if it's the ``++None++`` value, which can be returned implicitly by omitting the ``++return++`` statement, or explicitly. 


The ``++__init__++`` method is required to return ``++None++``. A ``++TypeError++`` will be raised if the ``++__init__++`` method either ``++yield++``s or ``++return++``s any expression other than ``++None++``. Returning some expression that evaluates to ``++None++`` will not raise an error, but is considered bad practice.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.message = 'Hello'
        return self  # Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class MyClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.message = 'Hello'
