``++NotImplemented++`` is a constant which is intended to be used only by comparison methods such as ``++__lt__++``. Use it instead of  ``++NotImplementedError++``, which is an exception, and callers will have a hard time using your code.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyClass:
    def do_something(self):
        raise NotImplemented("Haven't gotten this far yet.")  #Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class MyClass:
    def do_something(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Haven't gotten this far yet.")
