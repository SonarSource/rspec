== Why is this an issue?

A ``++polymorphic class++`` defines or inherits at least one virtual function. In some circumstances, copy-construction or assignment of such a class can inadvertently lead to casting from the derived class to the base class, which is a cause of slicing.


In most cases, you will prevent copying in a whole class hierarchy by preventing it in the base class only:

* You can define an ``++=delete++`` copy constructor and assignment operator in the base class.
* You can define an ``++=delete++`` move assignment operator, which will disable all other copy/move operations (this is less explicit, but since you only have to explicitly disable one function, some authors recommend this approach)
* Copy can be implicitly disabled by some existing members of the base class

This rule reports an issue if a polymorphic class is publicly copyable.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class B { // Noncompliant: B is copyable
public:
  virtual ~B() = default;
  virtual char m() { return 'B'; }
  // ... nothing about copy operations, so uses default ...
};

class D : public B { // Noncompliant: D is copyable
public:
  char m() override { return 'D'; }
  // ...
};

char f(B& b) {
  auto b2 = b;
  return b.m();
}

void test() {
  D d;
  char c = f(d); // c=='B', not what was expected
}
----


=== Compliant solution

To avoid such bugs, first disable copy.

Then, if you want to still be able to duplicate an object using the right polymorphic type, you can implement a virtual ``++clone()++`` function, which contrary to the copy-constructor can be overridden.


[source,cpp]
----
class B {
public:
  B() = default;
  virtual ~B() = default;
  B(const B&) = delete;
  B& operator=(const B&) = delete;
  virtual char m() { return 'B'; }
  virtual unique_ptr<B> clone() const {
    auto retptr = make_unique<B>();
    // some cloning code
    return retptr;      
  };
  // ...
};

class D : public B {
public:
  char m() override { return 'D'; }
  D() = default;
  unique_ptr<B> clone() const override {
    auto retptr = make_unique<D>();
    // some cloning code
    return retptr;
    }
    // ...
};

// char f_compile_error(B& b) {
//   auto b2 = b; // ok, compiler will detect inadvertent copying, and protest
//   return b2.m(); 
// }

char f(B& b) {
  auto b2 = b.clone();
  char c = b2->m();
  return c; 
}

void test() {
  D d;
  char c = f(d);  // c=='D'
}
----


=== Exceptions

Exceptions classes must be copyable. Hence, this rule does not apply to exceptions.
