== Why is this an issue?

Public arrays, even ones declared ``++static final++`` can have their contents edited by malicious programs. The ``++final++`` keyword on an array declaration means that the array object itself may only be assigned once, but its contents are still mutable. Therefore making arrays ``++public++`` is a security risk.


Instead, arrays should be private and accessed through methods.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
public class Estate {
  // Noncompliant; array contents can be modified
  public static final String [] HEIRS = new String [] { 
    "Betty", "Suzy" };
}

public class Malicious {
  public void changeWill() {
    Estate.HEIRS[0] = "Biff";
    if (Estate.HEIRS.length > 1) {
      for (int i = 1; i < Estate.HEIRS.length; i++) {
        Estate.HEIRS[i] = "";
      }
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
public class Estate {
  private static final String [] HEIRS = new String [] { 
    "Betty", "Suzy" };

  public String [] getHeirs() {
    // return copy of HEIRS
  }
}
