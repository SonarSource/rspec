Software projects often rely on external code libraries, known as dependencies. Package managers, such as {package-manager}, allow developers to reference dependencies for their projects. These dependencies simplify development, but also introduce risk as they download and include external code based on a project’s configuration. When adding a dependency, developers often specify a range of acceptable versions, such as any version beginning with ``++1.2++``. When the project is built, the package manager performs dependency resolution. This process involves checking the repository and selecting one specific version that satisfies the version range, which becomes the resolved dependency.

Dependency resolution becomes a security concern when the specific resolved version is not recorded or "locked." Without a file containing the locked version, the resolution process runs every time the project is built on a new system. The core issue is that the package manager will always query the repository to find the most recent version available, rendering the application vulnerable when malicious versions of dependencies are released.

This is often a key component of what is called a "supply chain attack." The attacker isn’t directly attacking your application. Instead, they are attacking a component you use. This is an important consideration because the attack’s source is less obvious. You might diligently secure your own code, but overlook the risk introduced by external dependencies.
