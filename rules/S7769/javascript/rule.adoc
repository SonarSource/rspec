This rule triggers when legacy mathematical expressions are used that can be replaced with modern Math APIs introduced in ES2015.

== Why is this an issue?

ES2015 introduced many new Math methods that provide clearer, more readable alternatives to complex mathematical expressions. Using these modern APIs offers several benefits:

**Improved readability**: Modern Math methods express mathematical intent more clearly. For example, `Math.log10(x)` immediately tells you that you're calculating a base-10 logarithm, while `Math.log(x) / Math.LN10` requires mathematical knowledge to understand.

**Better performance**: Native Math methods are typically optimized by JavaScript engines and can perform better than equivalent manual calculations.

**Reduced error potential**: Complex mathematical expressions are more prone to mistakes. Using dedicated methods reduces the chance of calculation errors.

**Standardized approach**: Modern Math APIs provide a consistent way to perform common mathematical operations across different codebases.

The most common cases involve logarithmic calculations and distance calculations using the Pythagorean theorem, where the intent becomes much clearer with modern APIs.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using legacy mathematical patterns instead of modern Math APIs reduces code readability and maintainability. Complex expressions are harder to understand and more error-prone. Performance may also be suboptimal compared to native implementations.

=== How to fix?


Replace Math.log() expressions with Math.log10() for base-10 logarithms.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const result1 = Math.log(x) * Math.LOG10E; // Noncompliant
const result2 = Math.log(x) / Math.LN10; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const result1 = Math.log10(x);
const result2 = Math.log10(x);
----
