== Why is this an issue?

The new style of class creation, with the declaration of a parent class, created a unified object model in Python, so that the type of an instantiated class is equal to its class. In Python 2.2-2.7, this is not the case for old-style classes. In Python 3+ all classes are new-style classes. However, since the behavior can differ from 2.2+ to 3+, explicitly inheriting from ``++object++`` (if there is no better candidate) is recommended.

class MyClass():
    pass

=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
class MyClass(object):
    pass
