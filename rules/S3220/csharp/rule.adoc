The rules for method resolution are complex and perhaps not properly understood by all coders. The ``++params++`` keyword can make method declarations overlap in non-obvious ways, so that slight changes in the argument types of an invocation can resolve to different methods.


This rule raises an issue when an invocation resolves to a method declaration with ``++params++``, but could also resolve to another non-``++params++`` method too.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyClass
{
    private void Format(string a, params object[] b) { }

    private void Format(object a, object b, object c) { }
}

// ...
MyClass myClass = new MyClass();

myClass.Format("", null, null); // Noncompliant, resolves to the first Format with params, but was that intended?
