Mobile OS uses software keyboards that provide text predictions and suggestions. It rely on caching text inputs in a local file in order to speed up typing and recall frequent phrases. When users type sensitive data into a text field where keyboard cache is enabled, the data will be exposed in clear-text in a local file. It will keep appearing in the keyboard suggestion list until the cache is cleared.

== Why is this an issue?

Keyboard caches are not designed to store sensitive information. Data they contain is not encrypted and can be exposed in device backups or when the device is shared.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
TextField(
    value = text,
    onValueChange = { text = it },
    label = { Text("Password") },
    visualTransformation = PasswordVisualTransformation(),
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Text) // Noncompliant: keyboard cache is enabled
)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
TextField(
    value = text,
    onValueChange = { text = it },
    label = { Text("Password") },
    visualTransformation = PasswordVisualTransformation(),
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Password)
)
----
