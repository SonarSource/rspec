Developers who maintain libraries or APIs annotate code as deprecated to indicate that the method, class, or other programming element is no longer recommended for use, usually because it has been superseded by a newer or more effective alternative. For example, when they've found a better solution or when the existing code is prone to errors or security risks. 

Deprecation is a good practice because it helps to phase out obsolete code in a controlled manner, without breaking existing software that may still depend on it. It is a way to warn other developers not to use the deprecated element in new code, and to replace it in existing code when possible. 

Deprecated classes, interfaces, and their members should not be used, inherited or extended because they will eventually be removed. The deprecation period allows you to make a smooth transition away from the aging, soon-to-be-retired technology.
