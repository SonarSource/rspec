== Why is this an issue?

In the interest of code clarity, ``++static++`` member variables of a base class should never be accessed using a derived type's name. Doing so is confusing and could create the illusion that two different static variables exist. If the variable is ``++const++``, there is no risk of confusion.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Parent {
  public:
    static int count;
    static Color const defaultColor = green;
};

class Child : public Parent {
  public:
    Child() : myColor(Child::defaultColor) { // Compliant: defaultColor is a constant
      Child::count++;  // Noncompliant
    }
};
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Parent {
  public:
    static int count;
    static Color const defaultColor = green;
};

class Child : public Parent {
  public:
    Child() : myColor(Child::defaultColor) { // Compliant: defaultColor is a constant
      Parent::count++;
    }
};

I'm able to identify:

* the static member name "count"
* the qualifier that prefix the member "Child"

But to be able to create the message:

{code}Replace "X" with "Y".{code}


It's sometime ambigus to propose the replacement, in the above example it can be "Parent", "ParentAlias1" or "ParentAlias2".


That's why I propose a message with only the member name and the qualifier name:

{code} Do not access "Z" with derived type "X".{code}


In this case it would be:

{code} Do not access "count" with derived type "Child".{code}
