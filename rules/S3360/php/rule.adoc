== Why is this an issue?

For better organization and clarity in test suites, test classes should end with `*Test.php`.
This naming convention helps to easily identify and distinguish test classes from other classes in the codebase.
It allows for automated test runners or frameworks to locate and execute the tests systematically.

The PHPUnit command-line test runner will look for `*Test.php` files.
In that case, test files without this pattern are ignored and not executed without warning.

=== What is the potential impact?

When tests are ignored or skipped, there can be several negative impacts on the development process and code quality.

Firstly, ignoring tests can lead to undetected bugs and vulnerabilities, as the skipped tests are not being executed and their associated functionality is not being thoroughly tested.
This increases the risk of releasing software with undiscovered issues.

Furthermore, skipped tests can result in a false sense of confidence, as developers might assume that the code is functioning correctly without proper validation.

This can lead to regression issues or unexpected behavior in the future when changes are made to the codebase.

== How to fix it
=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class TestClassX extends PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase {  // Noncompliant

  public void testDoTheThing() {
    //...
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,php,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class ClassXTest extends PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase {

  public void testDoTheThing() {
    //...
----
