An unused paragraph is never called explicitly with help of the ``++GO TO++`` or ``++PERFORM++`` statements.
There are only two reasons for such a paragraph:

* It is really unused, and should be removed
* It is used as a kind of comment to clearly delimit a block of code, which is bad practice

The remediation action should be:

* Replace the paragraph by a comment line
* Refactor the code to make an explicit call to this paragraph instead of letting the execution flow going through it implicitly
