== Ask Yourself Whether

* Your WebView loads content from arbitrary URLs or third-party sources (e.g., advertisements, external links)
* A malicious redirection within the WebView could lead to a phishing attack or credential theft
* The WebView displays sensitive information or interacts with features that could be compromised if the user is redirected to a malicious site

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.
