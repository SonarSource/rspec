By default, WebViews in `webview_flutter` and `flutter_inappwebview` allow users to navigate to any URL by clicking links or through JavaScript-initiated navigations. This behavior contrasts with native Android WebViews, which typically open new URLs in an external browser, thereby providing users with important context like a visible URL bar. `webview_flutter` and similar frameworks deviate from this safer native default, permitting arbitrary navigations unless explicitly configured otherwise. This means the WebView behaves more like an embedded browser without the usual security cues.

Permitting unrestricted navigation within an app's WebView can lead to significant security vulnerabilities. For instance, an element within the page (e.g., an ad) could redirect the user to a convincing phishing site designed to steal credentials. Since the WebView is part of the trusted application and lacks standard browser interface elements, users are more susceptible to such deception. Furthermore, if a page with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is loaded, the ability to navigate freely can expand the attack's scope or be used to further mislead the user. This loss of contextual security makes it difficult for users to identify and avoid malicious websites.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* Your WebView loads content from arbitrary URLs or third-party sources (e.g., advertisements, external links)
* A malicious redirection within the WebView could lead to a phishing attack or credential theft
* The WebView displays sensitive information or interacts with features that could be compromised if the user is redirected to a malicious site

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

=== Restrict Navigation

To prevent navigation to arbitrary URLs, all navigation attempts within the WebView need to be intercepted and validated.

For `webview_flutter`, this is done by providing a `NavigationDelegate` to the `WebViewController`. The `onNavigationRequest` callback in this delegate is called for every navigation attempt (e.g., when a user clicks a link or JavaScript tries to change the location). This callback allows the application to inspect the target URL and decide whether to allow the navigation by returning `NavigationDecision.navigate` or block it by returning `NavigationDecision.prevent`.

For `flutter_inappwebview`, the `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` callback on the `InAppWebView` widget serves a similar purpose. For this callback to be invoked, the `useShouldOverrideUrlLoading` option in `InAppWebViewSettings` must be set to `true`. When a navigation is attempted, this callback receives details about the navigation action. The application can then return `NavigationActionPolicy.ALLOW` to permit the navigation or `NavigationActionPolicy.CANCEL` to block it.

By implementing these respective callbacks, developers can enforce a strict navigation policy, such as blocking all navigations (most secure for static content WebViews), allowing navigations only to a predefined set of trusted domains (allow-listing), or deciding to open certain links in an external browser application rather than within the WebView itself.

== Sensitive Code Example

The default configurations for both `webview_flutter` and `flutter_inappwebview` allow arbitrary navigation.

In `webview_flutter`, setting no `NavigationDelegate` or using the default one will allow the user to navigate to any URL.

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import 'package:webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';

final WebViewController controller = WebViewController()  // Sensitive - all navigations are permitted by default
  ..setJavaScriptMode(JavaScriptMode.unrestricted)
  ..loadRequest(Uri.parse('https://example.com/'));
----

In `flutter_inappwebview`, all navigation is permitted when `useShouldOverrideUrlLoading` is set to `false` or when no `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` callback is provided:

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import 'package:flutter_inappwebview/flutter_inappwebview.dart';

InAppWebView(
  initialUrlRequest: URLRequest(url: WebUri('https://example.com/')),
  initialSettings: InAppWebViewSettings(  // Sensitive - all navigations are permitted by default
    javaScriptEnabled: true,
  ),
);
----

== Compliant Solution

In `webview_flutter`:

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import 'package:webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';

final WebViewController controller = WebViewController()
  ..setJavaScriptMode(JavaScriptMode.unrestricted)
  ..setNavigationDelegate(
    NavigationDelegate(
      onNavigationRequest: (NavigationRequest request) {
        final Uri uri = Uri.parse(request.url);
        if (uri.host == 'example.com') {
          return NavigationDecision.navigate;
        }

        return NavigationDecision.prevent;
      },
    ),
  )
  ..loadRequest(Uri.parse('https://example.com/'));
----

In `flutter_inappwebview`:

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
// flutter_inappwebview: Restricted navigation
import 'package:flutter_inappwebview/flutter_inappwebview.dart';

// Within your widget's build method or state:
// ...
  InAppWebView(
    initialUrlRequest: URLRequest(url: WebUri('https://example.com/')),
    initialSettings: InAppWebViewSettings(
      javaScriptEnabled: true,
      useShouldOverrideUrlLoading: true,
    ),
    shouldOverrideUrlLoading: (controller, navigationAction) async {
      final uri = navigationAction.request.url;
      if (uri != null && uri.host == 'example.com') {
        return NavigationActionPolicy.ALLOW;
      }

      return NavigationActionPolicy.CANCEL;
    },
  );
// ...
