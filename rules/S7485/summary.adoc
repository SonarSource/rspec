By default, WebViews in `webview_flutter` and `flutter_inappwebview` allow users to navigate to any URL by clicking links or through JavaScript-initiated navigations. This behavior contrasts with native Android WebViews, which typically open new URLs in an external browser, thereby providing users with important context like a visible URL bar. `webview_flutter` and similar frameworks deviate from this safer native default, permitting arbitrary navigation unless explicitly configured otherwise. This means the WebView behaves more like an embedded browser without the usual security indicators.

Permitting unrestricted navigation within an app's WebView can lead to significant security vulnerabilities. For instance, an element within the page (e.g., an ad) could redirect the user to a convincing phishing site designed to steal credentials. Since the WebView is part of the trusted application and lacks standard browser interface elements, users are more susceptible to such deception. Furthermore, if a page with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is loaded, the ability to navigate freely can expand the attack's scope or be used to further mislead the user. This loss of contextual security makes it difficult for users to identify and avoid malicious websites.
