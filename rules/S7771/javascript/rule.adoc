This rule raises an issue when code uses `object.length - index` calculations in methods that support negative indexing, such as `slice()`, `at()`, `splice()`, and others.

== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript provides negative indexing for many array and string methods, which allows accessing elements from the end of a collection using negative numbers. When you write `array.slice(array.length - 2, array.length - 1)`, you're doing unnecessary calculations that make the code harder to read and understand.

Negative indices are more concise and express the intent more clearly. The expression `-2` immediately tells you "second from the end", while `array.length - 2` requires mental calculation to understand the same concept.

Using negative indices also reduces the risk of errors. With `array.length - index` calculations, you might accidentally use the wrong variable name or make arithmetic mistakes. Negative indices eliminate these potential sources of bugs.

Additionally, negative indices are more performant since they avoid the property access to `.length` and the subtraction operation, though this performance difference is typically negligible in practice.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue affects code readability and maintainability. While it doesn't cause runtime errors, it makes code unnecessarily verbose and harder to understand. The extra `.length` property accesses and arithmetic operations also add minor performance overhead.

=== How to fix?


Replace `object.length - n` with `-n` in method calls that support negative indexing. This works for methods like `slice()`, `at()`, `splice()`, and others on arrays, strings, and typed arrays.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const lastTwo = array.slice(array.length - 2); // Noncompliant
const lastElement = array.at(array.length - 1); // Noncompliant
array.splice(array.length - 1, 1); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const lastTwo = array.slice(-2);
const lastElement = array.at(-1);
array.splice(-1, 1);
----
