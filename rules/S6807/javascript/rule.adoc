== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/jsts/aria-intro-1.adoc[]

Each role in ARIA has a set of required attributes that must be included for the role to be properly understood by assistive technologies. These attributes are known as "required aria-* properties".

For example, if an element has a role of "checkbox", it must also include the aria-checked property. This property indicates whether the checkbox is checked (true), unchecked (false), or in a mixed state (mixed).

This rule checks that each element with a defined ARIA role also has all required attributes.

== How to fix it in JSX

Check that each element with a defined ARIA role also has all required attributes.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<div role="checkbox">Unchecked</div> {/* Noncompliant: aria-checked is missing */}
----

To fix the code add missing aria-* attributes.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked={isChecked}>Unchecked</div>
----
