== Why is this an issue?

Each role in ARIA has a set of required attributes that must be included for the role to be properly understood by assistive technologies. These attributes are known as "required aria-* properties".

For example, if an element has a role of "checkbox", it must also include the aria-checked property. This property indicates whether the checkbox is checked (true), unchecked (false), or in a mixed state (mixed).

This rule checks that each element with a defined ARIA role also has all required attributes.
