I really debated one rule or two because the problems caused are different in magnitude, but since the title and the recommendation are the same for both I combined. Let me know if you'd like me to split.

 Since one case will result in a runtime error (critical) and the other one in a (major) recommandation I tend to think they should be split with different severity (but implementation will probably be shared).
