If the denominator to an integer division or remainder operation is zero, a
`ArithmeticException` is thrown.

include::./introduction.adoc[]

== Why is this an issue?

A division (`/`) or remainder operation (`%`) by zero indicates a bug or logical
error.
This is because in Java, a division or remainder operation where the denominator
is zero and not a floating point value always results in an
`ArithmeticException` being thrown.

When working with ``++double++`` or ``++float++`` values, no exception will be
thrown, but the operation will result in special floating point values
representing either positive infinity, negative infinity, or `NaN`.
Unless these special values are explicitly handled by a program, zero
denominators should be avoided in floating point operations, too.
Otherwise, the application might produce unexpected results.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void test_divide() {
  int z = 0;
  if (unknown()) {
    // ..
    z = 3;
  } else {
    // ..
  }
  z = 1 / z; // Noncompliant, possible division by zero
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void test_divide() {
  int z = 0;
  if (unknown()) {
    // ..
    z = 3;
  } else {
    // ..
    z = 1;
  }
  z = 1 / z;
}

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

This rule supports primitive ``++int++``, ``++long++``, ``++double++``, and
``++float++`` values, as well as ``++BigDecimal++`` and ``++BigInteger++``.
