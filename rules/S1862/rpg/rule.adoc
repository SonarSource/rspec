== Why is this an issue?

A ``++Select++`` or a chain of ``++If++``/``++Elseif++`` statements is evaluated from top to bottom. At most, only one branch will be executed: the first one with a condition that evaluates to ``++true++``. 


Therefore, duplicating a condition automatically leads to dead code. Usually, this is due to a copy/paste error. At best, it's simply dead code and at worst, it's a bug that is likely to induce further bugs as the code is maintained, and obviously it could lead to unexpected behavior.
