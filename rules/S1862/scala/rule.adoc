A ``++match++`` and a chain of ``++if++``/``++else if++`` statements is evaluated from top to bottom. At most, only one branch will be executed: the first one with a condition that evaluates to ``++true++``.


Therefore, duplicating a condition automatically leads to dead code. Usually, this is due to a copy/paste error. At best, it's simply dead code and at worst, it's a bug that is likely to induce further bugs as the code is maintained, and obviously it could lead to unexpected behavior.


For a ``++match++``, the second ``++case++`` will never be executed, rendering it dead code. Worse there is the risk in this situation that future maintenance will be done on the dead case, rather than on the one that's actually used.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (param == 1) {
  openWindow
} else if (param == 2) {
  closeWindow
} else if (param == 1) { // Noncompliant
  moveWindowToTheBackground
}

param match {
  case 1 =>
  // ...
  case 3 =>
  // ...
  case 1 => // Noncompliant
  // ...
  case _ =>
  //...
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
if (param == 1) {
  openWindow
} else if (param == 2) {
  closeWindow
} else if (param == 3) {
  moveWindowToTheBackground
}

param match {
  case 1 =>
  // ...
  case 3 =>
  // ...
  case _ =>
  //...
}
