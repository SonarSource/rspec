== Why is this an issue?

A ``++switch++`` and a chain of ``++if++``/``++else if++`` statements is evaluated from top to bottom. At most, only one branch will be executed: the first one with a condition that evaluates to ``++true++``. 


Therefore, duplicating a condition automatically leads to dead code. Usually, this is due to a copy/paste error. At best, it's simply dead code and at worst, it's a bug that is likely to induce further bugs as the code is maintained, and obviously it could lead to unexpected behavior. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
if param == 1 {
  openWindow()
} else if param == 2 {
  closeWindow()
} else if param == 1 {            // Noncompliant
  moveWindowToTheBackground()
}

switch i {
  case 1:
    //...
  case 3:
    //...
  case 1:                         // Noncompliant
    //...
  default:
    // ...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,swift]
----
if param == 1 {
  openWindow()
} else if param == 2 {
  closeWindow()
} else if param == 3 {
  moveWindowToTheBackground()
}

switch i {
  case 1:
    //...
  case 3:
    //...
  default:
    // ...
}
