A chain of ``++if++``/``++else if++`` statements is evaluated from top to bottom. At most, only one branch will be executed: the first one with a condition that evaluates to ``++true++``.


Therefore, duplicating a condition automatically leads to dead code. Usually, this is due to a copy/paste error. At best, it's simply dead code and at worst, it's a bug that is likely to induce further bugs as the code is maintained, and obviously it could lead to unexpected behavior.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (param == 1)
  openWindow();
else if (param == 2)
  closeWindow();
else if (param == 1)  // Noncompliant
  moveWindowToTheBackground();

== Compliant Solution

----
if (param == 1)
  openWindow();
else if (param == 2)
  closeWindow();
else if (param == 3)
  moveWindowToTheBackground();
