The use of `+find+` allows `+document.getElementById()+` to be used for the top-level selection, and saves the jQuery Sizzle engine for where it's really needed. That makes the query faster, and your application more responsive.

From the jQuery documentation:

{quote}
Beginning your selector with an ID is always best.
The `+.find()+` approach is faster because the first selection is handled without going through the Sizzle selector engine – ID-only selections are handled using `+document.getElementById()+`, which is extremely fast because it is native to the browser.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
var $productIds = $("#products div.id"); // Noncompliant - a nested query for Sizzle selector engine
----


== Compliant Solution

----
var $productIds = $("#products").find("div.id"); // Compliant - #products is already selected by document.getElementById() so only div.id needs to go through Sizzle selector engine
----
