XML Signatures are used to secure data and provide data integrity, message authentication, and signer authentication. An XML Signature is made of an XML document that can be tampered with. This is why XML Signatures must be verified and validated to not lose their initial purpose.
The XML Digital Signature API provides a feature to process XML Signatures in a secure way. This is achieved by enabling the "Secure Validation Mode" which is activated by default when the application is running with a security manager. There is no reason to not activate this "Validation Mode" and therefore this rule raises each time XML Signatures are used without explicitly activating it.
