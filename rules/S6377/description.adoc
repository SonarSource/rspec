XML document can be signed to ensure data integrity and authentication. The signature should be verified and validated to make sure it's secure. For instance, signatures based on weak cipher algorithms like MD5 should be rejected, and an XML document should not contain hostile constructs that can lead to Denial of Services attacks, like a large number of `SignedInfo` elements.
