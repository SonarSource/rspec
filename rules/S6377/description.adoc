XML signature validations work by parsing third-party data that cannot be trusted until it is actually validated.

As with any other parsing process, unrestricted validation of third-party XML signatures can lead to security vulnerabilities. In this case, threats range from denial of service to confidentiality breaches. +
To protect the application from these vulnerabilities, the ``org.jcp.xml.dsig.secureValidation`` attribute enforces the following restrictions:

* Forbids the use of XSLT transforms
* Restricts the number of ``SignedInfo`` or ``Manifest Reference`` elements to 30 or less
* Restricts the number of ``Reference`` transforms to 5 or less
* Forbids the use of MD5-related signatures or MAC algorithms
* Ensures that ``Reference`` IDs are unique to help prevent signature wrapping attacks
* Forbids Reference URIs of type ``http``, ``https``, or ``file``
* Does not allow a ``RetrievalMethod`` element to reference another ``RetrievalMethod`` element
* Forbids RSA or DSA keys less than 1024 bits

In addition, the ``jdk.xml.dsig.secureValidationPolicy`` Security Property can be used to control and fine-tune the restrictions listed previously or add additional restrictions.
