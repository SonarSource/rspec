=== Risk of Injection Attacks

Disabling secure validation can expose the application to injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious code or entities into the XML document, taking advantage of the weakened validation process. In some cases, it can also expose the application to denial-of-service attacks. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the validation process to cause excessive resource consumption or system crashes, leading to service unavailability or disruption.
