=== Increased Vulnerability to Signature Spoofing

By disabling secure validation, the application becomes more susceptible to
signature spoofing attacks. Attackers can potentially manipulate the XML
signature in a way that bypasses the validation process, allowing them to forge
or tamper with the signature. This can lead to the acceptance of invalid or
maliciously modified signatures, compromising the integrity and authenticity of
the XML documents.
