=== Increased Vulnerability to Signature Spoofing

By disabling secure validation, the application becomes more susceptible to signature spoofing attacks. Attackers can potentially manipulate the XML signature in a way that bypasses the validation process, allowing them to forge or tamper with the signature. This can lead to the acceptance of invalid or maliciously modified signatures, compromising the integrity and authenticity of the XML documents.
