== Why is this an issue?

Indexes in C# provide direct access to an element at a specific position within an array or collection. When compared to `Enumerable` methods, indexing can be more efficient for certain scenarios, such as iterating over a large collection, due to its avoidance of the overhead of creating intermediate result sets and performing multiple iterations.
