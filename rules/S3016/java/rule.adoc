The use of ``++short++``s saves a little bit of memory, but actually increases processor use because the JVM has no real capability for handling ``++short++``s. Instead, it must convert each ``++short++`` to an ``++int++`` before performing any operations on it, then convert it back to a ``++short++`` for storage.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyClass {
  short s = 0;  // Noncompliant

  public short doubleSmallNumber(short num) {  // Noncompliant
    return num+num;
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public class MyClass {
  int s = 0;

  public int doubleSmallNumber(int num) {
    return num+num;
  }
}
