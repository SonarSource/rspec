In frequently used code paths, such as controller actions, you should avoid using directly the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient[HttpClient] and you should opt for the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory[HttpClientFactory] instead. This way you avoid waste of resources and performance overhead.


== Why is this an issue?

If a code path that creates and disposes of HttpClient objects is frequently used then the following issues can occur: 

- Performance overhead from creating a new HttpClient for every HTTP request.

- Under heavy load, there's the risk of https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient-guidelines#pooled-connections[running out of available sockets], leading to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socketexception[SocketException] errors. This is because each HttpClient instance uses a separate network connection, and there's a limit to the number of connections that can be opened at the same time.

- Each HttpClient has its own set of resources (like headers, base address, timeout, etc.) that need to be managed. Creating a new HttpClient for every request means these resources are not being reused, leading to a waste of resources.

== How to fix it

The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory[`IHttpClientFactory`] was introduced in http://ASP.NET Core 2.1 as a solution to these problems. It handles pooling HTTP connections to optimize performance and reliability. It is additionally thread-safe.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----

[ApiController]
[Route("controller")]
public class FooController : Controller
{
	[HttpGet]
    public async Task<string> Foo()
    {
        using (var client = new HttpClient())  //Non-compliant
        {
            return await client.GetStringAsync(_url);
        }
    }
}

----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// File: Startup.cs
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddHttpClient();
        // ...
    }
}

[ApiController]
[Route("controller")]
public class FooController : Controller
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

	public FooController(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
	{
		_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	}

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<string> Foo()
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient(); // Compliant
        return await client.GetStringAsync(_url);
    }
}
