<div class="paragraph">
<p>An unused local variable is a variable that has been declared but is not used anywhere in the block of code where it is defined. It is dead code, contributing to unnecessary complexity and leading to confusion when reading the code. Therefore, it should be removed from your code to maintain clarity and efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having unused local variables in your code can lead to several issues:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Decreased Readability</strong>: Unused variables can make your code more difficult to read. They add extra lines and complexity, which can distract from the main logic of the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misunderstanding</strong>: When other developers read your code, they may wonder why a variable is declared but not used. This can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the code&#8217;s intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential for Bugs</strong>: If a variable is declared but not used, it might indicate a bug or incomplete code. For example, if you declared a variable intending to use it in a calculation, but then forgot to do so, your program might not work as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance Issues</strong>: Unused variables can make code maintenance more difficult. If a programmer sees an unused variable, they might think it is a mistake and try to 'fix' the code, potentially introducing new bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory Usage</strong>: Although modern compilers are smart enough to ignore unused variables, not all compilers do this. In such cases, unused variables take up memory space, leading to inefficient use of resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, unused local variables can make your code less readable, more confusing, and harder to maintain, and they can potentially lead to bugs or inefficient memory use. Therefore, it is best to remove them.</p>

<p>Variables passed by reference to functions whose name contains <code>by_ref</code> are considered used. In bash, some functions accept variable names as plain word arguments (not <code>$var</code> expansions) and modify them indirectly. When such a function name contains <code>by_ref</code>, word arguments matching declared variable names are counted as legitimate usages.</p>

<p>The fix for this issue is straightforward. Once you ensure the unused variable is not part of an incomplete implementation leading to bugs, you just need to remove it.</p>
