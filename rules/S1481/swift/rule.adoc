=== Exceptions

Simple `for-in` loop counters are ignored by this rule because while they are often legitimately unused, their declaration is required by the syntax.

[source,swift]
----
for i in 1...10 {  // Ignored
  print("Hello! ");
}
----

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public func numberOfMinutes(hours:Int) -> Int {
  var seconds = 0   // Noncompliant - seconds is unused 
  return hours * 60;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public func numberOfMinutes(hours:Int) -> Int{
  return hours * 60
}
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] LGTM. Only thing i'm not sure: implementation ignores "lonely" counters but raises issue for other (tuples). WDYT should we put such details in description? (from my point of view we shouldn't, but how knows :))

I'm assuming/hoping that "lonely" is the recognized term for this type of counter in Swift circles?

\[~ann.campbell.2] No :) "lonely" is just my explanation. I replaced it with ``++simple++``.
