\[~ann.campbell.2] LGTM. Only thing i'm not sure: implementation ignores "lonely" counters but raises issue for other (tuples). WDYT should we put such details in description? (from my point of view we shouldn't, but how knows :))

for i in 1...10 {  // Ignored
  print("Hello! ");
}

for (a, b) in someElements {  // issue for "b"
  print(a)

I'm assuming/hoping that "lonely" is the recognized term for this type of counter in Swift circles?
