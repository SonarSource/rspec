\[~nicolas.harraudeau] - this rule is not as useful for Java, where there's the ``++throws++`` keyword in the method signature if there is a call to a method that throws an exception. In C#, there's no such mechanism, so we can just look if there's a ``++throw++`` inside the method body. Is this useful enough?

\[~andrei.epure] indeed the value of this rule is lower. The only real-world use case I see is if there is a ``++throw++`` in a ``++try-catch++`` block and the exceptions caught do not match the one thrown. => Unintentional throw outside of the try-catch block. This is a corner case which will happen very rarely so there is no point in implementing the rule for C#.
