\[~ann.campbell.2] BTW regarding the message, the rule create an issue on the first invalid element found in the file, with the message from the validator engine.

For example, for a Maven Project Model:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>helloWorld</groupId>
    <artifactId>helloWorld</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <hello> </hello>      // <-- "Invalid content was found starting with element 'hello'."

</project>
----

So I am not sure on how it should be formulated.

\[~linda.martin] I've simplified the description of the filePattern parameter, but otherwise this looks fine to me.

In fact [~linda.martin], I've realized that the description of the filePattern parameter should probably specify which wildcards (if any) may be used.
