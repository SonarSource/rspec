== Why is this an issue?

Special attention should be paid when initializing class members: it is easy to get it wrong and initialize them with references that are going to be invalidated at the end of the constructor, known as dangling references.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct S {
  int *x;
  int &y;
  S(int i, int j) :
    x(&i),  // Noncompliant, initializing x to the stack address of i
    y(j)  // Noncompliant, y is bound to variable j which has a shorter lifetime
  {}
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct S {
  int *x;
  int &y;
  S(int *i, int &j) : x(i), y(j) {}
};
