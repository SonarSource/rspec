== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

If attackers gain access to a BitBucket OAuth credentials, they will be able to interact with BitBucket API on behalf of the compromised account.

=== What is the potential impact?

Bitbucket keys allow external services to access resources on a user’s behalf with the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
They are used to authenticate applications, services, or APIs using BitBucket for login and access-control.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

=== Code examples


==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("bitbucket.oauth-key", "MP76PZGLQmw63rxZYJ") // Noncompliant
props.set("bitbucket.oauth-secret", "ASgzPac3EPbXHbTSw6DyUagJZ8ThnUFG") // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant,subs="attributes"]
----
props.set("bitbucket.oauth-key", System.getenv("BITBUCKET_OAUTH_KEY")
props.set("bitbucket.oauth-secret", System.getenv("BITBUCKET_OAUTH_SECRET")
