== Why is this an issue?

A function or stored procedure that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such function or stored procedure inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller functions or stored procedures which focus on well-defined tasks. Those smaller functions or stored procedures will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.

\[~christophe.zurn], you plan to implement this as "too many lines of code", rather than "too many lines" (including comments, blank lines, ...), right?

\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes, that's the goal. I inspired myself from the other implementations, but after explanations I understood that we aim to go with LOC instead of of just lines

\[~ann.campbell.2]In the same direction, should we change the message "This [function|method|module|subroutine] "XXXX" has {0} lines, which is greater than the {1} lines authorized. Split it into smaller [functions|methods|modules|subroutines]." to explicitly say "lines of code" instead of just "lines" ?
