A function or stored procedure that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such function or stored procedure inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller functions or stored procedures which focus on well-defined tasks. Those smaller functions or stored procedures will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
