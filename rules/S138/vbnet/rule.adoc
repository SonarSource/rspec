A procedure that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.

Such procedures inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain. 


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller procedures which focus on well-defined tasks.

Those smaller procedures will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.
