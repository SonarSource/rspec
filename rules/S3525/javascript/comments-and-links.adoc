On my side, I don't agree with the description. First, JavaScript did not support classes at all before ES2015: prototypes are not classes. Secondly, the biggest argument in favor of applying this rule is that people are much more used to class-based languages rather than prototype-based languages: that does not make prototype-based OOP a nightmare.
