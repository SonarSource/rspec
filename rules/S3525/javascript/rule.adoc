Originally JavaScript didn't support ``++class++``es, and class-like behavior had to be kludged using things like ``++prototype++`` assignments for "class" functions. Fortunately, ECMAScript 2015 added classes, so any lingering ``++prototype++`` uses should be converted to true ``++class++``es. The new syntax is more expressive and clearer, especially to those with experience in other languages.


Specifically, with ES2015, you should simply declare a ``++class++`` and define its methods inside the class declaration.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function MyNonClass(initializerArgs = []) {
  this._values = [...initializerArgs];
}

MyNonClass.prototype.doSomething = function () {  // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class MyClass {
  constructor(initializerArgs = []) {
    this._values = [...initializerArgs];
  }

  doSomething() {
    //...
  }  
}
----
