== Why is this an issue?

This rule leads to greater precision in the definition of the function interface. The const qualification should be applied to the object pointed to, not to the pointer, since it is the object itself that is being protected.


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]

void myfunc( int16_t * param1, const int16_t * param2, const int16_t * param3)
{
*param1 = *param2 + *param3;
return;
