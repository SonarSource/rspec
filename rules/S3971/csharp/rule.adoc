``++GC.SuppressFinalize++`` requests that the system not call the finalizer for the specified object. This should only be done when implementing ``++Dispose++`` as part of the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose[Dispose Pattern].

This rule raises an issue when ``++GC.SuppressFinalize++`` is called outside that pattern.
