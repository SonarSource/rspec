== Why is this an issue?

Using a unique ``++KLIST++`` to access files ensures that the correct key is used at all times and creates a standard method of accessing the data throughout the code, simplifying maintenance and improving readability. 


This rule flags non-compliant instances of ``++CHAIN++``, ``++DELETE++``, ``++READE++``, ``++READPE++``, ``++SETGT++``, and ``++SETLL++`` operations.


=== Noncompliant code example

C     'D001 B'      CHAIN     KYCUSTN                            20
