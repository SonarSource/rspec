Azure Active Directory offers built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups or service principals.
Some of these roles should be assigned carefuly as they grant sensitive permissions like the ability to reset passwords for all users.

An Azure account that fails to limit the use of such highly privileged roles has a higher risk of becoming fully compromise by an malicous actor if a single identity is ever compromised.

This rule raise an issue when one of the following roles is assigned:

- Application Administrator
- Authentication Administrator
- Cloud Application Administrator
- Global Administrator
- Groups Administrator
- Helpdesk Administrator
- Password Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator
- Privileged Role Administrator
- User Administrator
