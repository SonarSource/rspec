== Why is this an issue?

UNIX/POSIX functions can have undefined behavior if they are not called correctly. More specifically:

* allocation size of ``++calloc++``, ``++malloc++``, ``++realloc++``, ``++reallocf++``, ``++alloca++`` and ``++valloc++`` should be strictly positive
* ``++open++`` and ``++openat++`` should be called with a flag that contains one access mode: ``++O_RDONLY++``, ``++O_WRONLY++``, or ``++O_RDWR++``
* ``++open++`` and ``++openat++`` with flag ``++O_CREAT++`` should be called with a third argument
* flag ``++O_EXCL++`` should be used with ``++O_CREAT++``
* first argument of ``++pthread_once++`` should not have automatic storage duration and should be initialized by ``++PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT++``


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int res = open(file, O_CREAT); // Noncompliant, flag O_CREAT requires a third argument

void *mem = alloca(0); // Noncompliant, allocation of 0 bytes

extern void initialize();
pthread_once_t pthread = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
pthread_once(&pthread, initialize); // Noncompliant, do not pass a local variable as argument
