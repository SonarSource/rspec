== Why is this an issue?

It is often considered good practice at the end of an override to invoke ``++super++``, but there are cases where according to the Apple developer documentation this should not be done.


* ``++updateLayer++`` - optimize the rendering of your view
* ``++loadView++`` - provide a ``++view++`` when ``++view++`` is ``++nil++``
* ``++providePlaceholder++`` - provide a placeholder for a document returned by the Document Picker but not yet stored locally

In all cases, these are actions that should happen once and only once. Subsequently invoking ``++super++`` would see your desired result replaced (at best) by less specialized results.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
class VC: UIMyViewController {
  override func loadView() {
    // ...  
    super.loadView()
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,swift]
----
class VC: UIMyViewController {
  override func loadView() {
    // ...  
  }
}
