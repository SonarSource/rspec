== Why is this an issue?

Namespaces represent a cross-file named scope. They are very useful to organize code and interfaces without cluttering a unique namespace. For instance, they provide a much cleaner way to avoid name collisions than using bad long names.


Namespaces can be nested to provide even more structure to type and symbol names. In that case, namespaces can be nested one inside another like scopes would with curly braces.


In {cpp}17, a new concise syntax was introduced to increase the readability of nested namespaces. It is much less verbose and involves much less curly braces-delimited scopes. Whereas declaring a nested namespace of depth N requires N pairs of curly braces with the original syntax, this new syntax requires only one pair of curly braces. This syntax is much more readable and less error-prone. When possible, non-inlined or inlined (since {cpp}20) named namespaces should be concatenated.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
namespace geometry { // Noncompliant
  namespace common {
    class point {
    };
  }
}

namespace geometry { // Noncompliant since C++20
  inline namespace triangle  {
    class edge {
    };
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
namespace geometry::common {
  class point {
  };
}

namespace geometry::inline triangle { // C++20
  class edge {
  };
}

namespace sonarsource { // Compliant: cannot be concatenated
  namespace core {
    class Rule {
    };
  }
  class A {
  };
}
