Variadic arguments allow a function to accept any number of arguments (in this rule, we are not talking about variadic templates, but about functions with ellipses). But these arguments have to respect some criteria to be handled properly.

This rules reports an issue if the type of the argument: 

* is a non trivially copyable, movable or deletable type: there is no guarantee that it will work.
* is a class type that is trivially copyable, movable and deletable: in this case, we consider that the user intention was probably not to directly pass it as an argument but to call a method on it (``++c_str()++`` for example)


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class A {
  char* toStr();
};
void v(...);

void f() {
  A a;
  v(a); // Noncompliant

  std::string myString = "foo";
  v(myString); // Noncompliant; string is not a POD type
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class A {
  char* toStr();
}
void v(...);

void f() {
  A a;
  v(a.toStr()); // Compliant

  std::string myString = "foo";
  v(myString.c_str()); // Compliant
}
----
