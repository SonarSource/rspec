This rule seems to overlap almost completely with https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-2681[S2681]


Given the non-compliant example:


----
if (condition)  // Noncompliant
doTheThing();
doTheOtherThing(); // <- S2681 "This line will not be executed conditionally; only the first line of this 3-line block will be ..."
somethingElseEntirely();

foo();
----

Fixing the indentation or using blocks stops S2681 from raising. Do we need both rules?


\[UPDATE] The wording of this rule and S2681 and examples have been updated.

During a LaYC sprint, I removed dummy implementations for the following language:

* apex
* flex
* rust
* scala
* solidity

It is not implemented in the corresponding analyzer and there currently are no tickets open in order to do so.
