== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

[source,csharp]
----
if (condition)  // Noncompliant
DoTheThing();
DoTheOtherThing(); // Was the intent to call this function unconditionally?
----

It becomes even more confusing and bug-prone if lines get commented out.

[source,csharp]
----
if (condition)  // Noncompliant
//   DoTheThing();
DoTheOtherThing(); // Was the intent to call this function conditionally?
----

Indentation makes the intent clear.

[source,csharp]
----
if (condition)
  DoTheThing();
DoTheOtherThing(); // Clear intent to call this function unconditionally
----

This rule raises an issue if the line controlled by a conditional has the same indentation as the conditional and is not enclosed in curly braces.
