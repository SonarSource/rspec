== Why is this an issue?

When the line immediately after a conditional has neither an enclosing `BEGIN...END` block nor indentation, the intent of the code is unclear and perhaps not what is executed. Additionally, such code is confusing to maintainers.

[source,sql]
----
IF @condition  -- Noncompliant
EXEC doTheThing;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Was the intent to call this function unconditionally?
----

It becomes even more confusing and bug-prone if lines get commented out.

[source,sql]
----
IF @condition  -- Noncompliant
--  EXEC doTheThing;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Was the intent to call this function conditionally?
----

Indentation alone or together with `BEGIN...END` block makes the intent clear.

[source,sql]
----
IF @condition
  EXEC doTheThing;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Clear intent to call this function unconditionally


IF @condition
BEGIN
  EXEC doTheThing;
END;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Clear intent to call this function unconditionally
----

This rule raises an issue if the line controlled by a conditional has the same indentation as the conditional and is not enclosed in a `BEGIN...END` block.
