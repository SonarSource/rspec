== Why is this an issue?

In the absence of enclosing ``++BEGIN...END++`` block, the line immediately after a conditional is the one that is conditionally executed. By both convention and good practice, such lines are indented.

In the absence of both ``++BEGIN...END++`` block and indentation the intent of the original programmer is unclear and perhaps not what is executed. Additionally, such code is confusing to maintainers.

[source,sql]
----
IF @condition  -- Noncompliant
EXEC doTheThing;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Was the intent to call this function unconditionally?
----

It becomes even more confusing and bug-prone if lines get commented out.

[source,sql]
----
IF @condition  -- Noncompliant
--  EXEC doTheThing;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Was the intent to call this function conditionally?
----

Indentation makes the intent clear.

[source,sql]
----
IF @condition
  EXEC doTheThing;
EXEC doTheOtherThing; -- Clear intent to call this function unconditionally
----

This rule raises an issue if the line controlled by a conditional has the same indentation as the conditional and is not enclosed in curly braces.
