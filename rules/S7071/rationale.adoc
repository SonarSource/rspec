Chromium uses process sandboxing to separate components that are part of 
its attack surface from the rest of the application. Since Electron uses 
Chromium internally, the same sandboxing principle is used here for the 
renderers and for preload scripts.

Renderer sandboxing is a critical component of the security model of 
Electron. Within the renderer, it is only possible to access a limited 
subset of APIs. Any privileged actions, e.g. filesystem interactions or 
spawning subprocesses, have to be executed through IPC with the main 
process. If renderer sandboxing is disabled, then an attacker who gains 
code execution within the renderer (for example through XSS) can pivot 
this easily into file system access and RCE.
