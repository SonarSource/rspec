=== What is the potential impact?

If sandboxing is not enabled in an Electron application, the potential 
impact can be severe and multifaceted:

==== Security Breaches
Malicious code running within the application can gain unrestricted access 
to system resources, leading to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, 
or even complete system compromise.

==== Data Integrity
Without sandboxing, there is a higher risk of data corruption or manipulation, 
as malicious scripts can interfere with the application's data handling processes.

==== User Privacy
Sensitive user information, such as personal data, credentials, 
and other private information, can be exposed to unauthorized access, leading 
to privacy violations.

==== Reputation Damage
Security incidents can lead to a loss of user trust and damage the reputation 
of the organization responsible for the application, resulting in potential 
financial and reputational losses.
