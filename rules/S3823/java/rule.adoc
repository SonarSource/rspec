== Why is this an issue?

The use of a "RESOURCE_LOCAL" ``++persistence-unit++`` makes you responsible for your own entity management, which involves a lot of extra boilerplate code to get right. Instead, set this to "JPA" in a JavaSE environment or omit it altogether in a JavaEE environment, where "JPA" is the default.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
<persistence-unit transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">  <!-- Noncompliant -->
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
<persistence-unit transaction-type="JTA">
