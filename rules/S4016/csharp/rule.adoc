== Why is this an issue?

If an ``++enum++`` member's name contains the word "reserved" it implies it is not currently used and will be change in the future. However changing an ``++enum++`` member is a breaking change and can create significant problems. There is no need to reserve an ``++enum++`` member since a new member can be added in the future, and such an addition will usually not be a breaking change.


This rule raises an issue when the name of an enumeration member contains "reserved".
