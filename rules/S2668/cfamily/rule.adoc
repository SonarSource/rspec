It is possible to use the increment operator ``{plus}{plus}``, to set the value of a ``++bool++``({cpp}) or ``++_Bool++``+(C)+ variable to ``++true++``. But this feature has been deprecated in {cpp} since the 1998 version of the standard, removed in {cpp}17, and even where allowed, is simply confusing.
