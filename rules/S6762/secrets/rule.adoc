== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

If an attacker gains access to a Grafana personal access token or Granafa Cloud token, they might be able to compromise the Grafana environment linked to this token. By doing so, it might be possible for business-critical data to be leaked by the attacker.

=== What is the potential impact?

Depending on the permissions given to the secret, the impact might range from the compromise of the data of some dashboards to a full takeover of the Grafana environment.  

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/data_compromise.adoc[]

==== Application takeover

With control over the Grafana application, the attacker can modify dashboards, alter data sources, or inject malicious code. This can result in the manipulation of displayed data, misleading visualizations, or even the introduction of backdoors for further exploitation.

The attacker may even attempt to escalate their privileges within the Grafana environment. By gaining administrative access or higher-level permissions, they can perform more significant actions, such as modifying access controls, adding or deleting users, or changing system configurations.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import requests

token = 'glsa_geygSnIfuK5vBG0KgaflRCQfIb8mzaM7_b0999d91'  # Noncompliant
response = requests.get('https://grafana.example.org/api/dashboards/home', headers={
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
})
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import requests

token = os.getenv('GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN')
response = requests.get('https://grafana.example.org/api/dashboards/home', headers={
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
})
