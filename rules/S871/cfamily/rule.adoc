== Why is this an issue?

{cpp} allows the traditional C-style casts  [E.G. ``++(int) f++``] and functional notation casts [E.G. ``++int(f)++``], but adds its own forms:


* ``++static_cast<type>(expression)++``
* ``++const_cast<type>(expression)++``
* ``++dynamic_cast<type>(expression)++``
* ``++reinterpret_cast<type>(expression)++``
* ``++std::bit_cast<type>(expression)++`` (since {cpp}20)

C-style casts and functional notation casts are largely functionally equivalent. However, when they do not invoke a converting constructor, C-style casts are capable of performing dangerous conversions between unrelated types and of changing a variable's ``++const++``-ness. Attempt to do these things with an explicit {cpp}-style cast, and the compiler will catch the error. Use a C-style or functional notation cast, and it cannot.


Moreover, {cpp}20 has introduced a ``++std::bit_cast++`` as a way of reinterpreting a value as being of a different type of the same length preserving its binary representation. The behavior of such conversion when performed via C-style cast or ``++reinterpret_cast++`` is undefined.


Additionally, {cpp}-style casts are preferred because they are visually striking. The visual subtlety of a C-style or functional cast may mask that a cast has taken place, but a {cpp}-style cast draws attention to itself, and makes the the programmer's intention explicit.


This rule raises an issue when C-style cast or functional notation cast is used.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

class Base { };

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
  int a;
};

void DoSomethingElse(Derived *ptr)
{
  ptr->a = 42;
}

void DoSomething(const Base *ptr)
{
  Derived* derived = (Derived*)ptr; // Noncompliant; inadvertently removes constness
  DoSomethingElse(derived);
}

void checksBits(float f)
{ 
    int x = *(int*)&f; // Noncompliant; has undefined behavior
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  Derived *ptr = new Derived();
  ptr->a = 1337;

  DoSomething(ptr);

  std::cout << ptr->a << std::endl; /* 1337 was expected, but 42 is printed */

  return 0;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
/* ... */

void DoSomething(const Base *ptr)
{
  /* error: static_cast from type 'const Base*' to type 'Derived*' casts away qualifiers */
  Derived* derived = static_cast<Derived*>(ptr); // Compliant. Compile fails with above error
  DoSomethingElse(derived);
}

void checksBits(float f)
{ 
    int x = std::bit_cast<int>(f); 
}

/* ... */
----


=== Exceptions

This rule ignores void casts. They are a common pattern to express that an expression is dropped on purpose.

[source,cpp]
----
(void)call(); // Compliant by exception
void(call()); // Compliant by exception
----

Furthermore, this rule ignores functional casts when creating an object of the same type (copy) or when they lead to calls to a constructor. In those cases, the purpose is clear and no dangerous conversion can happen.

[source,cpp]
----
class Clazz {
  Clazz(int, int);
};
Clazz create();

template<typename T>
void process(T&& t);

void foo(int i, Clazz c) {
  process(Clazz(1, 2));     // Compliant: constructor call
  process(Clazz(c));        // Compliant: copy
  process(auto(c));         // Compliant: copy
  process(Clazz(create())); // Compliant: copy
  process((Clazz)c);        // Noncompliant: C-Style cast
 
  process(int(i));  // Compliant: copy
  process(auto(i)); // Compliant: copy
  process((int)i);  // Noncompliant: C-style cast
}
