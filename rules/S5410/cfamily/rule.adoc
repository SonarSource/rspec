== Why is this an issue?

_Pointer arithmetic_ is a way of calculating the address of objects in memory, especially in arrays.

 It features operators ``{plus}{plus}+``, ``++---++``, ``++--=++``, ``{plus}{plus}=`` and subscript operator ``++[]++``.

 Pointer arithmetic relies on the type of the pointer to calculate the actual address in memory.

 Using the wrong type to do pointer arithmetic leads to wrong result and can corrupt memory. 

 ``++static_cast++`` can be used to change the type of a pointer. As a result, doing arithmetic on its return value would result in wrong arithmetic.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Base {
  int iBase = 0;
};

struct Derived : public Base {
  int iDerived = 0;
};

int main() {
  const size_t size = 4;
  Derived derivedArray[size];
  Base* basePointer = static_cast<Base*>(derivedArray);
  for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
    derivedArray[i].iBase = i;                                           // store : 0 1 2 3
    derivedArray[i].iDerived = i*1000;
  }
  for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
    cout<<"derivedArray["<<i<<"].iBase="<<derivedArray[i].iBase<<endl;   // display : 0 1 2 3
    cout<<"basePointer["<<i<<"].iBase="<<basePointer[i].iBase<<endl;     // display : 0 0 1 1000
  }
  return 0;
}
----
Pointer arithmetic should carried on with the initial pointer type and then the static cast should be applied.


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Base {
  int iBase = 0;
};

struct Derived : public Base {
  int iDerived = 0;
};

int main() {
  const size_t size = 4;
  Derived derivedArray[size];
  for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
    derivedArray[i].iBase = i;                                           // store : 0 1 2 3
    derivedArray[i].iDerived = i*1000;
  }
  for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
    cout<<"derivedArray["<<i<<"].iBase="<<derivedArray[i].iBase<<endl;   // display : 0 1 2 3
    cout<<"base of derivedArray["<<i<<"].iBase="<<static_cast<Base*>(derivedArray+i)->iBase<<endl;     // display : 0 1 2 3
  }
  return 0;
}

=== Exceptions

``++void*++`` is a special type of pointer as it is not typed. It is usually used in some complex schemes. This rule does not apply for a ``++static_cast++`` from a ``++void*++``.
