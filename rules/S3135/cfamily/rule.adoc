``++sizeof++`` returns the size in bytes of a type. ``++alignof++`` (since {cpp}-11) returns the alignment, in bytes, required for any instance of a type. Using any other kind of value with ``++sizeof++``, or ``++alignof++``, is likely a mistake - what is returned is the size, or alignment, of the operand's type.


This rule raises issues for the following ``++sizeof++``, and ``++alignof++`` calls:


* with parameters that have a ``++void++`` type. That is forbidden by both the C and {cpp} standards
* on a pointer type variable. This is typically a mistake; usually the intent is to get the size, or alignment, of the pointed-to value instead
* when the parameter is another ``++sizeof++``, or ``++alignof++`` call. ``++sizeof(sizeof(...))++`` indicates a misuse or misunderstanding of the ``++sizeof++`` construct
* when side effects are intended in the parameter. The side effects don't actually occur; the expression is not evaluated because ``++sizeof++`` only acts on the type of the expression
* when there are calculations within ``++sizeof++``, or ``++alignof++``; the result will be ``++sizeof(int)++``, or ``++alignof(int)++``, assuming the calculation's operands are ``++int++``s
* when numeric constants are used with ``++sizeof++`` or ``++alignof++``. Such calls simply return ``++sizeof(int)++`` or ``++alignof(int)++`` respectively.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void fun(int array[10]) {
  int length = 42;

  for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(array) / sizeof(*array); i++) { // Noncompliant, type of array decays to int *, so sizeof(array) evaluates to sizeof(int *)
    array[i] = 0;
  }

  size_t size = sizeof(i = 1234); // Noncompliant, side effect
  size = sizeof(i++); // Noncompliant, side effect

  size = sizeof(sizeof(i)); // Noncompliant, one sizeof call was intended

  char *cp = malloc(sizeof(length + 1));  // Noncompliant, calculation in parameter

  size = sizeof(10); // Noncompliant, constant as parameter

  void* p;
  alignof(*p);  // Noncompliant, void type
  alignof(void);  // Noncompliant, void type
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void fun(int array[10]) {
  int length = 42;

  for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    array[i] = 0;
  }

  int i = 1234;
  size_t size = sizeof( i );
  i++;
  size = sizeof (i);

  size = sizeof(i);

  char *cp = malloc((length + 1) * sizeof(char));

  size = sizeof(int);
}
