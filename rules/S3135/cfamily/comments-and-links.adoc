\[~massimo.paladin], I've made a few edits which you'll want to double-check, but I don't like the code example. I would have expected to see a ``++malloc++`` rather than an array declaration. Something like the following which is (when correctly written) a common idiom:

----
int size = 42;
char *cp = malloc(sizeof(char * size));  // Noncompliant
----
and

----
int size = 42;
char *cp = malloc(size * sizeof(char));

Also I favor moving ``++sizeof++`` out of RSPEC-2665 and consolidating all the bad arguments to ``++sizeof++`` here. That would leave RSPEC-2665 as: "alignof" should not be used with operands of a "void" type

FYI [~massimo.paladin] I suggest a title of: Valid arguments should be passed to "sizeof"

It's slightly more specific
