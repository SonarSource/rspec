== Why is this an issue?

React components have built-in `state` data. This data is used to store component property values. When `state` changes, the component is re-rendered. React provides the `useState` hook to manage the `state`. `useState` returns a state variable retaining the data and a state setter function to update its value.

React will skip re-rendering the component and its children if the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an `Object.is` comparison. When the setter function is called with the state variable as a parameter, that comparison will always be `true`, and the component will never be re-rendered. This can happen by mistake when attempting to reset a default value or invert a boolean, among others.

This rule raises an issue when calling the setter function with the state variable provided by the same `useState` React hook.

import { useState } from "react";

function ShowLanguage() {
    const [language, setLanguage] = useState("fr-FR");
    return (
      <section>
        <h1>Your language is {language}!</h1>
        <button onClick={() => setLanguage(navigator.language)}>Detect language</button>
        <button onClick={() => setLanguage(language)}>Je préfère le Français</button>{/* Non compliant: This button does nothing */}
      </section>
    );
};

Instead, you should call the setter with any parameter different from the state variable.

        <h1>Your language is {language}!</h1>
        <button onClick={() => setLanguage(navigator.language)}>Detect language</button>
        <button onClick={() => setLanguage("fr-FR")}>Je préfère le français</button>
      </section>
    );
};
