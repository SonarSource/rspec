``++std::jthread++``, introduced in {cpp}20, is a wrapper around ``++std::thread++``. This way, it has the same functionalities as ``++std::thread++``, making the substitution really straightforward, while adding two interesting behaviors:

* It joins by default in its destructor. If a ``++std::thread++`` was not joined or detached before being destroyed, a call to ``++std::terminate++`` was made. This can’t happen with ``++std::jthread++``.
* It can be canceled or stopped in some situations by calling ``++request_stop()++``

This rule raises an issue as soon as ``++std::thread++`` is used.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
void backgroundTask();
int main() {
  std::thread t(backgroundTask); // Noncompliant
  t.join();
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
void backgroundTask();
int main() {
  std::jthread jt(backgroundTask);
}
----
