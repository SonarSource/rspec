==== Parameterized Queries
For XPath injections, the cleanest way to do so is to use parameterized queries.

XPath allows for the usage of variables inside expressions in the form of `$variable`. We can use these variables to construct an XPath query without needing to concatenate user arguments to the query at runtime. Here is an example of an XPath query with variables:

----

/users/user[@user=$user and @pass=$pass]

----

When the XPath query is executed, the user input is passed alongside it. During execution, when the value of `$user` and `$pass` need to be known, a resolver will return the correct user input for each variable. The contents of the variables are not considered application logic by the XPath executor, and thus injection is not possible.
