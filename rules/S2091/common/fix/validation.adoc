==== Validation

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protect against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of an interpreted
context.

For Xpath injections, the cleanest way to do so is to validate the input before
using it in a Xpath query.

The most important validation is the restriction of XPath metacharacter, such
as:

* `"`
* `'`
* `/`
* `@`
* `=`
* `*`
* `[`
* `]`
* `(`
* `)`

Else, create a list of authorized and secure strings that you want the
application to be able to use in a query. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.

The list can be either a regex string, an array, or validators on specific
ranges of characters. If you use regexes, choose simple regexes to avoid ReDOS
attacks.

*Important note*: The application must do validation on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
