==== Validation

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protect against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of the initially
intended logic.

For Xpath injections, the cleanest way to do so is to use parameterized queries
if it is available for your use case. Else, the most secure way to do so is to
validate the input before using it in a Xpath query.

Create a list of authorized and secure strings that you want the application to
be able to use in a query. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.

The list can be either a regex string, an array, or validators on specific
ranges of characters. If you use regexes, choose simple regexes to avoid ReDOS
attacks.

*Important note*: The application must do validation on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.

As a last resort, the most important security mechanism is the restriction of
XPath metacharacters, such as:

* `"`
* `'`
* `/`
* `@`
* `=`
* `*`
* `[`
* `]`
* `(`
* `)`

For Java, OWASP's function

allows sanitizing these characters automatically.
