== How to fix it in antchfx/htmlquery

=== Code examples

The following noncompliant code is vulnerable to XPath injections because untrusted data is
inserted to an XPath query without prior validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/antchfx/htmlquery"
)

func authenticate(w http.ResponseWriter, request *http.request, doc *htmlquery.Node) {
	user := request.FormValue("user")
	password := request.FormValue("password")

	query := fmt.Sprintf("//user[username=\"%s\" and password=\"%s\"]", user, password)
	userObj := htmlquery.FindOne(doc, query)

	return userObj != nil
}
----

==== Compliant solution

As the library does not support prepared queries, the compliant solution requires sanitizing the user input.

[source,go,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	"github.com/antchfx/htmlquery"
)

func authenticate(w http.ResponseWriter, request *http.request, doc *htmlquery.Node) {
	user := request.FormValue("user")
	password := request.FormValue("password")

	user = strings.ReplaceAll(user, '"', "")
	user = strings.ReplaceAll(password, '"', "")

	query := fmt.Sprintf("//user[username=\"%s\" and password=\"%s\"]", user, password)
	userObj := htmlquery.FindOne(doc, query)

	return userObj != nil
}
----

=== How does this work?

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protect against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of the initially
intended logic.
