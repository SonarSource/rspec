== How to fix it in .NET

=== Code examples
The following code is vulnerable to XPath injections because untrusted data is
concatenated in an XPath query without prior validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    <HttpGet>
    Public Function Authenticate(User As String, Pass As String) As IActionResult
        Dim Doc As New XmlDocument()

        Dim Expression As String = "/users/user[@name='" & User & "' and @pass='" & Pass & "']"

        Return Json(Doc.SelectSingleNode(Expression) IsNot Nothing)
    End Function
End Class
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    <HttpGet>
    Public Function Authenticate(User As String, Pass As String) As IActionResult
        Dim Doc As New XmlDocument()
        ' restrict the username and password to letters only
        If Not Regex.IsMatch(User, "^[a-zA-Z]+$") OrElse Not Regex.IsMatch(Pass, "^[a-zA-Z]+$") Then
            Return BadRequest()
        End If

        Dim Expression As String = "/users/user[@name='" & User & "' and @pass='" & Pass & "']"

        Return Json(Doc.SelectSingleNode(Expression) IsNot Nothing)
    End Function
End Class

=== How does this work?

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protect against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of the initially
intended logic.

include::../../common/fix/validation.adoc[]

In the example, a validation mechanism is applied to untrusted input to ensure
it is strictly composed of alphabetic characters.
