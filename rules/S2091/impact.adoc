=== What is the potential impact?

In the context of a web application vulnerable to XPath injection: +
After discovering the injection point, attackers insert data into the vulnerable
field to execute malicious commands in the affected XML documents.

The impact of this vulnerability depends on the importance of XML
structures in the enterprise. +
In cases where organizations rely on XML structures for business-critical
operations or where XML is used only for innocuous data transport, the
severity of an attack ranges from critical to harmless.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Data Leaks

A malicious XPath query allows direct data leakage from one or more databases.
Although XML is not as widely used as it once was, this possibility still
exists with configuration files, for example.

==== Data deletion and denial of service

The malicious query allows the attacker to delete data in the affected XML
documents. +
This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP) and if XML structures are considered
important, as missing critical data can disrupt the regular
operations of an organization.
