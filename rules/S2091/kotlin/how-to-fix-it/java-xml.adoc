== How to fix it in Java XML API

=== Code examples

The following noncompliant code is vulnerable to XPath injections because untrusted data is
concatenated to an XPath query without prior validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import javax.xml.xpath.XPath
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants

fun authenticate(request: HttpServletRequest, xpath: XPath, doc: Document): Boolean {
    val user = request.getParameter("user")
    val pass = request.getParameter("pass")
    val expression = "/users/user[@name='$user' and @pass='$pass']"
    return xpath.evaluate(expression, doc, XPathConstants.BOOLEAN) as Boolean
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import javax.xml.xpath.XPath
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver

fun authenticate(request: HttpServletRequest, xpath: XPath, doc: Document): Boolean {
    val user = request.getParameter("user")
    val pass = request.getParameter("pass")
    val expression = "/users/user[@name=\$user and @pass=\$pass]"
    xpath.xPathVariableResolver = XPathVariableResolver { v: QName ->
        when (v.localPart) {
            "user" -> return@XPathVariableResolver user
            "pass" -> return@XPathVariableResolver pass
            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException()
        }
    }
    return xpath.evaluate(expression, doc, XPathConstants.BOOLEAN) as Boolean
}
----

=== How does this work?

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protect against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of the initially
intended logic.

include::../../common/fix/parameterized-queries.adoc[]

In the example, a parameterized XPath query is created, and an `XPathVariableResolver` is used to securely insert untrusted data into the query, similar to parameterized SQL queries.

include::../../common/fix/validation.adoc[]

For Java, OWASP's Enterprise Security API offers https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.owasp.esapi/esapi/latest/org/owasp/esapi/Encoder.html#encodeForXPath-java.lang.String-[`encodeForXPath`] which sanitizes metacharacters automatically.
