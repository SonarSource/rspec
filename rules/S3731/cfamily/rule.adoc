== Why is this an issue?

Before {cpp}11, ``++auto++`` was used as a storage class specifier that indicated automatic duration. Since that's the default, the use of ``++auto++`` in that context was wholly redundant.


Because the keyword was redundant and therefore rarely used, {cpp}11 repurposes it. ``++auto++`` is now used to specify that the type of the variable or function should be deduced from its context.


Since it is redundant under older standards and problematic under {cpp}11, ``++auto++``'s use as a storage-class identifier should be removed.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
auto int x; // Noncompliant: redundant before C++11, error as of C++11

auto int y;  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int x;

auto y = 1 + 2; // C++11: type of 'y' will be inferred
----
