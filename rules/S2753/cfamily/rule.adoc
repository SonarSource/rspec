== Why is this an issue?

Just as comparing apples and oranges is seen as a classic folly, comparing values from different enumerations against each other or converting them into one another is nonsensical. True, at root ``++enum++``s are simply named numbers, and it's certainly valid to compare numbers. But an added layer of meaning is created by an ``++enum++``, one that goes beyond simple numerical values.


Ignoring that extra layer of meaning is at best a trap for maintainers, who are likely to be hopelessly confused by the code. At worst, it is a bug, which will lead to unexpected results.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
enum apple {BRAEBURN, FUJI, GRANNY_SMITH, RED_DELICIOUS};
enum orange {BLOOD, NAVEL, BITTER, BERGAMOT, MANDARIN};

void makeCider(apple v);

bool fun(apple v1, orange v2) {
  makeCider((apple)v2); // Noncompliant
  return v1 != v2;  // Noncompliant 
}
