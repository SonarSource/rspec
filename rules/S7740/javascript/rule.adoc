This rule raises an issue when `this` is assigned to a variable.

== Why is this an issue?

Assigning `this` to a variable is an outdated JavaScript pattern that creates unnecessary complexity and reduces code readability.

In JavaScript, the value of `this` depends on how a function is called. Before ES6, developers commonly assigned `this` to a variable (like `self`, `that`, or `foo`) to preserve the context when calling functions where `this` would have a different value.

This pattern has several drawbacks:

* It creates additional variables that clutter the scope
* It can cause confusion about which context is being referenced
* It makes the code harder to understand and maintain
* It's prone to errors if the wrong variable is used

Modern JavaScript provides better alternatives that eliminate the need for this pattern. Arrow functions automatically preserve the lexical `this` binding, meaning they inherit `this` from the enclosing scope. The `Function.prototype.bind()` method can also explicitly set the `this` value for regular functions.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue affects code maintainability and readability. While not a security vulnerability, it can lead to bugs if developers accidentally use the wrong variable reference or if the captured `this` value becomes stale. Using modern alternatives makes the code more predictable and easier to understand.

=== How to fix?


Replace the variable assignment and function call with an arrow function that preserves the lexical `this` binding.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const foo = this;

setTimeout(function () {
	foo.bar(); // Noncompliant
}, 1000);
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
setTimeout(() => {
	this.bar();
}, 1000);
