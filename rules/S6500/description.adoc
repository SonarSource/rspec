Installing recommended packages automatically can lead to vulnerabilities in the
Docker image.

Potentially unnecessary packages are installed via a known Debian package
manager. These packages will increase the attack surface of the created
container as they might contain unidentified vulnerabilities or malicious code.
Those packages could be used as part of a broader supply chain attack.
In general, the more packages are installed in a container, the weaker its
security posture is. +
Depending on the introduced vulnerabilities, a malicious actor accessing such a
container could use these for privilege escalation. +
Removing unused packages can also significantly reduce your Docker image size.

To be secure, remove unused packages where possible and ensure images are
subject to routine vulnerability scans.
