Installing recommended packages automatically can lead to vulnerabilities in the
Docker image.

Potentially unnecessary packages are installed via a known Debian package
manager. These packages might contain vulnerabilities, thus weakening the
overall security posture of the created containers. +
Depending on the introduced vulnerabilities, a malicious actor accessing such a
container could use these for privilege escalation. +
Removing the unused packages can also significantly reduce your Docker image
size.

To be secure, remove unused packages where possible and ensure images are
subject to routine vulnerability scans.
