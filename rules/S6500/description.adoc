Installing unnecessary dependencies can lead to additional vulnerabilities in
the Docker image.

Unnecessary dependencies are installed via a known Debian package manager.
These unused dependencies might contain
vulnerabilities, thus weakening the overall security posture of the created
containers. +
Depending on the introduced vulnerabilities, a malicious actor accessing such a
container could use these for privilege escalation. +
Removing the unused dependencies can also significantly reduce your Docker image size.

To be secure, remove the unused dependencies where possible and ensure
images are subject to routine vulnerability scans.
