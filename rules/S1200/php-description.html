<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the Single Responsibility Principle, introduced by Robert C. Martin in his book "Principles of Object Oriented Design", a class should have only one responsibility:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a class has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changes to one responsibility may impair or inhibit the class' ability to meet the others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of coupling leads to fragile designs that break in unexpected ways when changed.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Classes which rely on many other classes tend to aggregate too many responsibilities and should be split into several smaller ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nested classes dependencies are not counted as dependencies of the outer class.</p>

<p>2 comments here:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, I changed the meaning</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>from: if you have more than X dependencies, you&#8217;re breaking SRP</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to: if you have more than X dependencies, you&#8217;re probably breaking SRP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>because the description clearly states that "there is no way to automatically check whether a class complies with the SRP&#8230;&#8203;" (If there&#8217;s no way to check, then we can&#8217;t automatically say you&#8217;re in violation based on the dependency count.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, I changed "a class should have only one reason to change" to "a class should have only one responsibility." I couldn&#8217;t make heads or tails of the former and finally guessed that it must have been a case of "distracted typing." Apologies if I was wrong.</p>

<p>IMO it&#8217;s bad to use the acronym "SRP" which is not a well-known one, especially in a sentence where "Single Reponsibility Principle" already appears as is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There must be a way to reformulate to avoid the repeatition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using acronyms increases what&#8217;s known as the "cognitive load", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load and makes the whole description more complex to understand.</p>
