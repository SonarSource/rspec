== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}11 improves the specification of the parser so that at the end of a template, multiple ``++>++``s will be interpreted as closing the template argument list rather than as the right shift operator or stream extraction operator. It is no longer required to place a space between the two ``++>++``s. 


This rule raises an issue when such useless spaces exist.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
vector<pair<int,int> > s; // Noncompliant

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
vector<pair<int,int>> s;
