== Why is this an issue?

Locking an account which has had too many sequential, failed login attempts within a short time can help resist brute force attacks. This rule raises an issue on authentication code so that such controls can be verified.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, principal);
env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);

DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext(env);  // Noncompliant
