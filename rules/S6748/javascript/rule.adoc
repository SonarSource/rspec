== Why is this an issue?

When using JSX the component children should be passed between opening and closing tags. Passing children in a `children` prop may work sometimes, but will lead to errors if children are passed both as nested components and `children` prop at the same time.

When not using JSX, the children should be passed to `createElement()` method as extra arguments after the `props` object.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<div children='Children' />
<Foo children={<Bar />} />

React.createElement("div", { children: 'Children' })
----

To fix the code, remove the `children` prop and pass the children between opening and closing JSX tags or as extra arguments to `createElement()` function.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<div>Children</div>
<Foo><Bar /></Foo>

React.createElement("div", {}, 'Children');
