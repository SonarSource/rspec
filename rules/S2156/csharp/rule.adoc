The difference between ``++private++`` and ``++protected++`` visibility is that child classes can see and use ``++protected++`` members, but they cannot see ``++private++`` ones. Since a ``++sealed++`` class cannot have children, marking its members ``++protected++`` is confusingly pointless.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public sealed class MySealedClass 
{
    protected string name = "Fred";  // Noncompliant
    protected void SetName(string name) // Noncompliant
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public sealed class MySealedClass 
{
    private string name = "Fred";
    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
