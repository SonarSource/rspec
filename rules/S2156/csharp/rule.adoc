The difference between ``private`` and ``protected`` visibility is that child classes can see and use ``protected`` members, but they cannot see ``private`` ones. Since a ``sealed`` class cannot have children, marking its members ``protected`` is confusingly pointless.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public sealed class MySealedClass 
{
    protected string name = "Fred";  // Noncompliant
    protected void SetName(string name) // Noncompliant
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public sealed class MySealedClass 
{
    private string name = "Fred";
    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----
