The difference between ``++private++`` and ``++protected++`` visibility is that child classes can see and use ``++protected++`` members, but they cannot see ``++private++`` ones. Since a ``++final++`` class will have no children, marking the members of a ``++final++`` class ``++protected++`` is confusingly pointless.

Note that the ``++protected++`` members of a class can also be seen and used by other classes that are placed within the same package, this could lead to accidental, unintended access to otherwise private members.
