== Why is this an issue?

The difference between ``++private++`` and ``++protected++`` visibility is that child classes can see and use ``++protected++`` members, but they cannot see ``++private++`` ones. Since a ``++final++`` class will have no children, marking the members of a ``++final++`` class ``++protected++`` is confusingly pointless.


Note that the ``++protected++`` members of a class can also be seen and used by other classes that are placed within the same package, this could lead to accidental, unintended access to otherwise private members.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public final class MyFinalClass {

  protected String name = "Fred";  // Noncompliant
  protected void setName(String name) {  // Noncompliant
    // ...
  }
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public final class MyFinalClass {

  private String name = "Fred";
  public void setName(String name) {
    // ...
  }
----


=== Exceptions

Members annotated withÂ ``++@VisibleForTesting++`` annotation are ignored, as it indicates that visibility has been purposely relaxed to make the code testable.

[source,java]
----
public final class MyFinalClass {
  @VisibleForTesting
  protected Logger logger; // Compliant

  @VisibleForTesting
  protected int calculateSomethingComplex(String input) { // Compliant
    // ...
  }
}
