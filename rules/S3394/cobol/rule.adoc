The ``++ACCEPT++`` keyword does no editing or error checking of the data it stores, therefore its use can be dangerous. For this reason, ``++ACCEPT++`` should be avoided. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
 01 USER-INPUT PIC X(4). 

  GET-USER-INPUT. 
       MOVE 'N' TO WS-NUMERIC. 
       PERFORM UNTIL WS-NUMERIC = 'Y' 
           DISPLAY 'ENTER YOUR 4 DIGIT RECORD NUMBER: ' NO ADVANCING 
           ACCEPT USER-RECORD *> Noncompliant 
----


== Exceptions

This rule ignores uses of ``++ACCEPT FROM++`` with date/time-related inputs.
