Functions that deal with iterators often use the notion of range: A range is a pair or iterators, ``++b++`` and ``++e++``, with the following conditions:

* ``++b++`` and ``++e++`` must refer to the same container
* ``++e++`` must be reachable from ``++b++``, which mean that by doing ``b{plus}{plus}`` enough times, we must reach ``++e++`` (another way to say it is that ``++b++`` must be before ``++e++`` in the container).

An invalid range will most of the time lead to undefined behavior.


This rule detects when two iterators that do not make a valid range are passed to a function that expects a range.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void test(std::vector<int> &v1, std::vector<int> &v2) {
  // First argument is the insert position, second and third arguments are the range to insert
  v1.insert(v1.begin(), v1.begin(), v2.end()); // Noncompliant, not in the same container
  std::sort(v1.end(), v1.begin()); // Noncompliant, the two parameters need to be swapped to define a valid range
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void test(std::vector<int> &v1, std::vector<int> &v2) {
  v1.insert(v1.begin(), v2.begin(), v2.end()); // Compliant
  std::sort(v1.begin(), v1.end()); // Compliant
}
