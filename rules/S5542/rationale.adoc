Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring secure communications in a variety of domains. They are used for
several important reasons:

* Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection
* Security during transmission or on storage devices
* Data integrity, general trust, and authentication

When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also
consider two things:

1. No encryption is unbreakable.
2. The strength of an encryption algorithm is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame.


For these reasons, as soon as cryptography is included in a project, it is
important to choose encryption algorithms that are considered strong and secure
by the cryptography community.

For AES, the weakest modes are CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) and ECB (Electronic Codebook) 
because they are either vulnerable to padding oracles or do
not provide authentication mechanisms.

For RSA, the weakest algorithms are either using it without padding or
using the PKCS1v1.5 padding scheme.
