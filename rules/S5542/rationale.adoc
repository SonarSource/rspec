Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring secure communications in a variety of domains. They are used for
several important reasons:

* Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection.
* Security during transmission or on storage devices.
* Data integrity, general trust, and authentication.

When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also
consider two things:

1. No encryption is absolutely unbreakable.
2. The strength of an encryption is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame.

For these reasons, once cryptography is involved in a project, it is important
to choose encryption algorithms that are considered the strongest by the
cryptography community.

For AES, the weakest modes are CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) and ECB (Electronic
Codebook), because they either are vulnerable to padding oracles or do not
provide authentication mechanisms.

And for RSA, the weakest padding scheme is PKCS1v1.5, worse is using no
padding at all.
