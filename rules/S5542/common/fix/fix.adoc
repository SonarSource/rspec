As a rule of thumb, use the cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms considered
strong by the cryptographic community.

As of today, the best choices are the following.

==== For AES: Use the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)

GCM mode combines encryption with authentication and integrity checks using
a cryptographic hash function, providing both confidentiality and authenticity
of the data.

Other similar modes include:

* CCM: `Counter with CBC-MAC`
* CWC: `Cipher-Block Chaining with Message Authentication Code`
* EAX: `Encrypt-and-Authenticate`
* IAPM: `Integer Authenticated Parallelizable Mode`
* OCB: `Offset Codebook Mode`

It is also possible to use AES-CBC with Hmac for integrity checks. However, it
is considered more straightforward to directly go for AES-GCM instead.

==== For RSA: Use the OAEP scheme

The Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding scheme (OAEP) adds randomness and a
secure hash function which hardens the regular inner workings of RSA.
