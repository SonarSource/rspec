Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring secure communications in a variety of domains. They are used for
several important reasons:

* Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection.
* Security during transmission or on storage devices.
* Data integrity, general trust, and authentication.

When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also
consider two things:

1. No encryption is absolutely unbreakable.
2. The strength of an encryption is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame.

For these reasons, once cryptography is involved in a project, it is important
to choose encryption algorithms that are considered the strongest by the
cryptography community.
