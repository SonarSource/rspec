== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.aesmanaged?view=netframework-4.8[AesManaged] object with insecure mode:

[source,csharp]
----
AesManaged aes4 = new AesManaged
{
  KeySize = 128,
  BlockSize = 128,
  Mode = CipherMode.ECB, // Noncompliant
  Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7
};
----

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider?view=netframework-4.8[RSACryptoServiceProvider] object without OAEP padding:

[source,csharp]
----
RSACryptoServiceProvider RSA1 = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
encryptedData = RSA1.Encrypt(dataToEncrypt, false); // Noncompliant: OAEP Padding is not used (second parameter set to false)
----

=== Compliant solution

AES with GCM mode with https://www.bouncycastle.org/[bouncycastle] library: 

[source,csharp]
----
GcmBlockCipher blockCipher = new GcmBlockCipher(new AesEngine()); // Compliant
blockCipher.Init(true, new AeadParameters(new KeyParameter(secretKey), 128, iv, null));
----

AES with GCM mode with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.aesgcm?view=netcore-3.0[AesGcm] object: 

[source,csharp]
----
var aesGcm = new AesGcm(key); // Compliant
----

RSA with OAEP padding with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider?view=netframework-4.8[RSACryptoServiceProvider] object: 

[source,csharp]
----
RSACryptoServiceProvider RSA2 = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
encryptedData = RSA2.Encrypt(dataToEncrypt, true); // Compliant: OAEP Padding is used (second parameter set to true)

\[~eric.therond]Â a Compliant Solution should be code. If you have no code to show, then the additional details should be incorporated in the description.

\[~eric.therond] Note that C# has a GCM mode since .NET Core 3.0 (See \https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/31389), but not yet in .NET Framework. It would be nice to have this mentioned as an alternate Compliant Solution.

Also, the rule mentions "RSA encryption algorithm should be used with the recommended padding scheme (OAEP)", but there is no example for such Noncompliant/Compliant code example.

Thanks [~christophe.zurn] I have added additional examples and updated https://github.com/SonarSource/security-expected-issues/blob/master/dotnet/rules/vulnerabilities/RSPEC-5542/Startup.cs[security-expected-issues repository]
