== Why is this an issue?

Servlets are components in Java web development, responsible for processing HTTP requests and generating responses.
In this context, exceptions are used to handle and manage unexpected errors or exceptional conditions that may
occur during the execution of a servlet.

When exceptions are caught and processed within the servlet, they can be converted into meaningful user-friendly
feedback. Otherwise, when exceptions are not caught within the servlet, they are propagated to the servlet container
which handles them globally with a default error-handling mechanism. And it can have several adverse consequences that
may impact the overall security and stability of the server.

Failing to handle exceptions in servlets can lead to the following problems:

1. *Vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks:* When exceptions are thrown but not caught or handled appropriately,
   they can leave the servlet container in an unstable state. This can potentially lead to resource exhaustion and
   denial-of-service attacks, where an attacker intentionally triggers exceptions to overwhelm the system and make it
   unresponsive to legitimate requests.

2. *Exposure of sensitive information:* When a servlet throws an exception, the default behavior of the servlet
   container is by default to send detailed error messages or debugging information back to the user. This information
   may contain sensitive details about the application's internal workings, such as stack traces, database connection
   details, or system configuration. Such information can be highly valuable to an attacker, providing insights into
   potential vulnerabilities and aiding them in planning further attacks.

Unfortunately, servlet method signatures do not force developers to handle `IOException` and `ServletException`:
[source,java]
----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
  //...
}
----

To prevent this risk, this rule enforces all exceptions to be caught within the "do*" methods of servlet classes.

== How to fix it

Surround all method calls that may throw an exception with a `try/catch` block.

=== Code examples

In the following example, the `getByName` method may throw an `UnknownHostException`.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
  InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(request.getRemoteAddr()); // Noncompliant
  //...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
  try {
    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(request.getRemoteAddr());
    //...
  }
  catch (UnknownHostException ex) {  // Compliant
    //...
  }
}
----

@Ann:

* I would activate this rule by default because I don't see when this rule might generate some false-positives
* I would associate the rule to the SQALE sub-characteristic "Error"
* I guess this rule belongs to OWASP Top 10 ?

as the result could be to stackTrace or information reply on the browser, we could consider this issue in OWASP-TOP10-A6

This is a good point [~sebastien.gioria] which raises another question: for the time being we tag a rule relating to a CWE item with tag "owasp-top10" if and only if in the MITRE CWE referential, this CWE item is part of http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/928.html[CWE-928: Weaknesses in OWASP Top Ten (2013)]. Do you think this is a too strong requirement [~sebastien.gioria] ?

Updating the message to explicitly mention which unhandled exception type triggered the issue (as the method invocation could already be in a try/catch block without a correct catch clause).
