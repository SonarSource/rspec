== Why is this an issue?

Even though the signatures for methods in a servlet include ``++throws IOException, ServletException++``, it's a bad idea to let such exceptions be thrown. Failure to catch exceptions in a servlet could leave a system in a vulnerable state, possibly resulting in denial-of-service attacks, or the exposure of sensitive information because when a servlet throws an exception, the servlet container typically sends debugging information back to the user. And that information could be very valuable to an attacker. 


This rule checks all exceptions in methods named "do*" are explicitly handled in servlet classes.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
  throws IOException, ServletException {
  String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
  InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip); // Noncompliant; getByName(String) throws UnknownHostException
  //...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
  throws IOException, ServletException {
  try {
    String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
    //...
  } 
  catch (UnknownHostException uhex) {
    //...
  }
}
----

@Ann:

* I would activate this rule by default because I don't see when this rule might generate some false-positives
* I would associate the rule to the SQALE sub-characteristic "Error"
* I guess this rule belongs to OWASP Top 10 ?

as the result could be to stackTrace or information reply on the browser, we could consider this issue in OWASP-TOP10-A6

This is a good point [~sebastien.gioria] which raises another question: for the time being we tag a rule relating to a CWE item with tag "owasp-top10" if and only if in the MITRE CWE referential, this CWE item is part of http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/928.html[CWE-928: Weaknesses in OWASP Top Ten (2013)]. Do you think this is a too strong requirement [~sebastien.gioria] ?

Updating the message to explicitly mention which unhandled exception type triggered the issue (as the method invocation could already be in a try/catch block without a correct catch clause).
