This is a good point [~sebastien.gioria] which raises another question: for the time being we tag a rule relating to a CWE item with tag "owasp-top10" if and only if in the MITRE CWE referential, this CWE item is part of http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/928.html[CWE-928: Weaknesses in OWASP Top Ten (2013)].
