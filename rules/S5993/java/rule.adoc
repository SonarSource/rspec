Abstract classes should not have public constructors. Constructors of abstract classes can only be called in constructors of their subclasses. So there is no point in making them public. The ``++protected++`` modifier should be enough.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractClass1 {
    public AbstractClass1 () { // Noncompliant, has public modifier
        // do something here
    }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractClass2 {
    protected AbstractClass2 () {
        // do something here
    }
}
----
