The ``iostream.h`` header was provided with the first {cpp} compiler, CFront, and became the de facto standard. During the formal standardization process of {cpp}, many shortcomings in ``iostream.h`` were fixed, but at the cost of introducing incompatibilities. Therefore, it was decided not to change the existing ``iostream.h`` and introduce the standard version as a new ``iostream`` header.

Modern compilers tend to remove the support of the legacy ``iostream.h`` header, and migrating to the standard version is encouraged.

This rule applies not only to ``iostream``, but to all standard {cpp} headers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#include <iostream.h> // Noncompliant
#include <fstream.h>  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
