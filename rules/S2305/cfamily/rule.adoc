The ``++iostream.h++`` header was provided with the first {cpp} compiler, CFront, and became the de facto standard. During the formal standardization process of {cpp}, many shortcomings in ``++iostream.h++`` were fixed, but at the cost of introducing incompatibilities. Therefore, it was decided not to change the existing ``++iostream.h++`` and introduce the standard version as a new ``++iostream++`` header.


Modern compilers tend to remove the support of the legacy ``++iostream.h++`` header, and migrating to the standard version is encouraged.


This rule applies not only to ``++iostream++``, but to all standard {cpp} headers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#include <iostream.h> // Noncompliant
#include <fstream.h>  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution
