== Why is this an issue?

The ``++iostream.h++`` header was provided with the first {cpp} compiler, CFront, and became the de facto standard. During the formal standardization process of {cpp}, many shortcomings in ``++iostream.h++`` were fixed, but at the cost of introducing incompatibilities. Therefore, it was decided not to change the existing ``++iostream.h++`` and introduce the standard version as a new ``++iostream++`` header.


Modern compilers tend to remove the support of the legacy ``++iostream.h++`` header, and migrating to the standard version is encouraged.


This rule applies not only to ``++iostream++``, but to all standard {cpp} headers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <iostream.h> // Noncompliant
#include <fstream.h>  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] hard to answer on this question as I'm not originator of this RSPEC, but quoting your description:

____
The iostream.h header was provided with the first {cpp} compiler,

____
also take into account the fact that there is no streams in C.

\[~ann.campbell.2] seems that this rule has been implemented long ago - see CPP-322. So I added "Legacy Key", please double check.


Also maybe you have an automated way to find all implementations, which are not associated with RSPECs ?

No automation for that [~evgeny.mandrikov] & I'm not sure it would be worth creating any since it ought to be a one-time job (and I thought I had already located all of these)
