This rule raises an issue when a variable assignment serves no purpose, such as assigning a variable to itself or when the assigned value is immediately overwritten without being used.

== Why is this an issue?

Useless assignments are statements that assign values to variables but serve no functional purpose in the program. These assignments can occur in several forms:

* **Self-assignments**: When a variable is assigned to itself (`x = x`), which has no effect
* **Immediately overwritten assignments**: When a variable is assigned a value and then immediately assigned a different value before the first value is used
* **Dead assignments**: When a variable is assigned but never read afterward

These assignments create several problems:

**Code clarity**: Useless assignments make code harder to read and understand. Developers waste time trying to figure out the purpose of assignments that have no effect.

**Maintenance burden**: Dead code increases the codebase size without adding value. It makes refactoring more difficult because developers must analyze whether seemingly unused code actually serves a purpose.

**Potential bugs**: Useless assignments often indicate logic errors. A self-assignment might suggest a copy-paste error, while immediately overwritten assignments could indicate missing logic or incorrect variable usage.

**Performance impact**: While Go's compiler optimizes away many useless assignments, they still consume developer time and can mask more serious issues in the code.

=== What is the potential impact?

Useless assignments reduce code quality and maintainability. They can hide logic errors, make code harder to understand, and waste developer time during code reviews and debugging sessions.

== How to fix it

Remove self-assignments that have no effect on the program state.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
func example() int {
    x := 5
    x = x  // Noncompliant: self-assignment has no effect
    return x
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
func example() int {
    x := 5
    return x
}
----
