== Why is this an issue?

During construction and destruction of an object, its final type may be different from that of the completely constructed object. The result of using an object’s dynamic type in a constructor or destructor may not be consistent with developer expectations.

The dynamic type of an object is used in the following constructs:

* ``++typeid++`` on a class with a virtual function or a virtual function in a base class.
* ``++dynamic_cast++``
* A virtual call to a virtual function.

This rule also prohibits a call being made to a pure virtual function from within a constructor or destructor. Such calls lead to undefined behaviour.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class B1
{
public:
  B1 ( )
  {
   typeid ( B1 ); // Compliant, B1 not polymorphic
  }
};
class B2
{
public:
  virtual ~B2 ( );
  virtual void foo ( );
  B2 ( )
  {
    typeid ( B2 ); // Noncompliant
    B2::foo ( ); // Compliant, not a virtual call
    foo ( ); // Noncompliant
    dynamic_cast< B2* > ( this ); // Noncompliant
  }
};
