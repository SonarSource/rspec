== Why is this an issue?


In some performance-oriented algorithms, a solution to certain slow operations is reinterpreting a value as a different type of the same length while preserving its binary representation.


One of the superseded solutions, known as "union type-punning", is to use a `union` with two members with types corresponding to the source and the target types of the cast.
The operation is performed by saving the value in the member of the source type and then reading the value from the member of the target type.
Despite being allowed in C, this operation has undefined behavior according to {cpp} standard and should be replaced by `std::memcpy` (or `std::bit_cast` in {cpp}20).


Note: `std::memcpy` has no performance impact on modern compilers when used in type-punning and is optimized during compilation.


Union type-punning can also be used to remove `const`. This can create readability issues and should be replaced with `const_cast`.


This rule raises an issue on any use of a `union` that should be replaced with `std::memcpy`, `std::bit_cast`, or `const_cast`.


=== What is the potential impact?


The {cpp} standard states that only one union member can be "active" at any time.
A member becomes active once assigned a value, making the other union members "inactive".
The standard also states that reading from an "inactive" member is undefined behavior.

Since union type-punning relies on reading the "inactive" member, code using it is undefined behavior.
Such code can be unintentionally removed in aggressive levels of optimization.

== How to fix it

Replace any "union type-punning" solution with a standard-compliant solution.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
float fastInvSqrt(float number) 
  constexpr float threehalfs = 1.5F;	
  const float x2 = number * 0.5F;

  union { 
     float f;
     uint32_t i;
  } conv;
  conv.f = number
  conv.i = 0x5f3759df - (conv.i >> 1);  // Noncompliant: undefined behavior
  conv.f *= threehalfs - (x2 * conv.f * conv.f); // Noncompliant: undefined behavior
  return conv.f;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Solution before {cpp}20:

[source,cpp]
----
float fastInvSqrt(float number) {
  constexpr float threehalfs = 1.5F;
  const float x2 = number * 0.5F;

  std::uint32_t i;
  std::memcpy(&i, &number, sizeof(float));
  i  = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);

  float result;
  std::memcpy(&result, &i, sizeof(float));
  result  *= threehalfs - (x2 * result * result);
  return result;
}
----

{cpp}20 and after:

[source,cpp]
----
float fastInvSqrt(float number) {
  constexpr float threehalfs = 1.5F;
  const float x2 = number * 0.5F;

  auto i = std::bit_cast<std::uint32_t>(number);
  i  = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);
  auto result = std::bit_cast<float>(i);
  result  *= threehalfs - (x2 * result * result);
  return result;
}
