== Why is this an issue?

Using a scalar function or an arithmetic expression in a ``++WHERE++`` condition can prevent the database from using indexes on the relevant column(s), and could therefore lead to performance issues. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]

SELECT * FROM MY_TABE WHERE C2 = C3 + :HostVar1  -- Noncompliant

SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE WHERE YEAR(BIRTHDATE) > 2000  -- Noncompliant
