== Why is this an issue?

`std::format` takes as an argument a format string that contains replacement fields (surrounded with `{}`)
and a set of extra arguments that will be formatted inside the replacement fields. 
Even if the format string is checked at compile-time, it is possible to have a mismatch between the format string and the arguments. For example, when:

* The format string contains fewer replacement fields than the number of extra arguments:
  `std::format("{} {}", 1, 2, 3);`
* The format string uses indexes for the replacement fields, but one index is missing:
  `std::format("{0} {0} {2}", 1, 2, 3);`
  
In these cases, the extra arguments are silently ignored. In the best-case scenario, it leads to dead code.
Otherwise, it is a typo, and the output will not be intended.

This rule detects when the arguments of `std::format` are unused in a way that doesn't trigger S6487.
Therefore, you should make sure that S6487 is enabled with this rule.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << std::format("{} {}", 1, 2, 3); // Noncompliant
std::cout << std::format("{0} {2}", 1, 2, 3); // Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << std::format("{} {} {}", 1, 2, 3); // Compliant
std::cout << std::format("{0} {1} {2} {1}", 1, 2, 3); // Compliant
----

* S6487 - A version of this rule triggers for cases that are likely a bug.
