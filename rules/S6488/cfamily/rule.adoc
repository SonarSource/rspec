When using `std::format`, you pass it a format string that contains replacement fields (surrounded with `{}`)
and some extra arguments that will be formatted inside those replacement fields. 
Even if the format string is checked at compile-time, it is possible to have a mismatch between the format string and the arguments:
* The format string contains fewer replacement fields than the number of extra arguments
  `std::format("{} {}", 1, 2, 3);`
* The format string uses indexes for the replacement fields, but one index is missing
  `std::format("{0} {0} {2}", 1, 2, 3);`

When that happens, the extra arguments are silently ignored. In the best scenario, it is dead code that could be removed, 
but more probably, it is a typo and the output will not be the expected one.

This rule detects when arguments are unused. It will only raise an issue in situations that would not raise an issue with S6487.
Therefore, if this rule is enabled, S6487 should be enabled too.

== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << std::format("{} {}", 1, 2, 3); // Noncompliant
std::cout << std::format("{0} {2}", 1, 2, 3); // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << std::format("{} {} {}", 1, 2, 3); // Compliant
std::cout << std::format("{0} {1} {2} {1}", 1, 2, 3); // Compliant
----

* S6487 - A version of that rule that only triggers for cases which are probably a bug.
