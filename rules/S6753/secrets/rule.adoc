Zuplo is an API management platform built for developers. It handles authentification and access to your API and provides additional functionalities such as rate limiting the number of requests to your backend.
In order for your backend to validate that a request has been processed by Zuplo, it relies on an API key generated in Zuplo Developer Portal. If this key is compromised, attackers will be able to bypass Zuplo and access your API without authentication and authorization.
