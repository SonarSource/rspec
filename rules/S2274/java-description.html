<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a multithreaded environment, the <code>Object.wait(&#8230;&#8203;)</code>, as well as <code>Condition.await(&#8230;&#8203;)</code> and similar methods are used to pause the execution of a thread until the thread is awakened.
A thread is typically awakened when it is notified, signaled, or interrupted, usually because of an event in another thread requiring some subsequent action by the waiting thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a thread may be awakened despite the desired condition not being met or the desired event not having happened.
This is referred to as "spurious wakeups" and may be caused by underlying platform semantics.
In other words, a thread may be awakened due to reasons that have nothing to do with the business logic.
Hence, the assumption that the desired condition is met or the desired event occurred after a thread is awakened does not always hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the documentation of the Java <code>Condition</code> interface [1]:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When waiting upon a <code>Condition</code>, a "spurious wakeup" is permitted to occur, in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same advice is also found for the <code>Object.wait(&#8230;&#8203;)</code> method [2]:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[&#8230;&#8203;] waits should always occur in loops, like this one:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>synchronized (obj) {
  while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;){
    obj.wait(timeout);

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure that the desired condition is actually true after being awakened. This can be accomplished by calling the <code>wait</code> or <code>await</code> methods inside a loop that checks said condition.</p>
