This rule flags uses of `Array.from()`, `Array#concat()`, `Array#slice()` without arguments, `Array#toSpliced()` without arguments, and `String#split('')` when the spread operator could be used instead.

== Why is this an issue?

The spread operator (`...`) is a modern JavaScript feature that provides a consistent and readable way to work with arrays and iterables. Using older methods like `Array.from()`, `Array#concat()`, `Array#slice()`, `Array#toSpliced()`, and `String#split('')` for operations that can be done with the spread operator leads to inconsistent code patterns.

The spread operator offers several advantages:

* **Consistency**: One operator handles multiple scenarios (copying arrays, converting iterables, combining arrays)
* **Readability**: The syntax is often more intuitive and expressive
* **Modern standards**: Aligns with current JavaScript best practices
* **Flexibility**: Works seamlessly with other modern JavaScript features

While the older methods are not incorrect, using the spread operator creates more uniform and maintainable code. This is especially important in larger codebases where consistency helps developers understand and modify code more efficiently.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using outdated array and string methods instead of the spread operator reduces code consistency and readability. While this doesn't introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities, it makes the codebase harder to maintain and understand, especially for developers familiar with modern JavaScript patterns.

=== How to fix?


Replace `Array.from()` with the spread operator when converting iterables to arrays.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const array = Array.from(set).map(element => foo(element)); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const array = [...set].map(element => foo(element));
----
