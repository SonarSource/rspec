== Why is this an issue?

Regardless of the logging framework in use (Microsoft.Extension.Logging, Serilog, Log4net or NLogâ€‹), logger fields should be:

* *private*: this restricts access to the logger from outside the class. Using any other access modifier would allow other classes to use the logger to log messages in the class where it's defined.
* *static*: by making the logger `static`, it doesn't depend on an instance of the class. This prevents unnecessary memory usage as the logger won't occupy extra space for every instance of the class created by the system.
* *readonly*: marking the field as `readonly` will prevent modifications. This ensures that the logger remains consistent and doesn't get accidentally reassigned or modified during the class's lifetime.

This rule should be activated when service locator design pattern is followed in place of dependency injection for logging.
