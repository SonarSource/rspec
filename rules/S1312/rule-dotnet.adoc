== Why is this an issue?

Regardless of the logging framework in use (Microsoft.Extension.Logging, Serilog, Log4net or NLog, ...â€‹), logger fields should be:

* *{private}*: this restricts access to the logger from outside the type (class, struct, record...). Using any other access modifier would allow other types to use the logger to log messages in the type where it's defined.
* *{static}*: by making the logger `{static}`, it doesn't depend on an instance of the type. This prevents unnecessary memory usage as the logger won't occupy extra space for every instance of the type created by the system.
* *{readonly}*: marking the field as `{readonly}` will prevent modifications. This ensures that the logger remains consistent and doesn't get accidentally reassigned or modified during the type lifetime.

This rule should be activated when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern[Service Locator Design pattern] is followed in place of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[Dependency Injection] for logging.
