\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes I've noticed them but they are different from the one we need (they are about using correctly the format string when this one is about security problem if we directly call ``++printf++`` with a string instead of using format strings).

\[~amelie.renard] if what you are describing is a potential vulnerability, shouldn't this RSPEC be hotspot or vulnerability? I am also wondering if we should target this for Java, PHP?
