== Why is this an issue?

It is a security vulnerability to call ``++printf++`` with a unique string argument which is not a string literal. Indeed, if this argument comes from a user input, this user can :

* make the program crash, by executing code equivalent to: ``++printf("%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s")++``
* view the stack or a memory at any location, by executing code equivalent to: ``++printf("%08x %08x %08x %08x %08x\n")++``


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f(char* userInput) {
  printf(userInput); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f(char* userInput) {
  printf("%s", userInput); // Compliant
}
----
