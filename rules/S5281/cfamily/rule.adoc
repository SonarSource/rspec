== Why is this an issue?

It is a security vulnerability to call ``++printf++`` with a unique string argument which is not a string literal. Indeed, if this argument comes from a user input, this user can :

* make the program crash, by executing code equivalent to: ``++printf("%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s")++``
* view the stack or a memory at any location, by executing code equivalent to: ``++printf("%08x %08x %08x %08x %08x\n")++``


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f(char* userInput) {
  printf(userInput); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f(char* userInput) {
  printf("%s", userInput); // Compliant
}
----

\[~amelie.renard] we already have RSPEC-3457 and RSPEC-2275 covering ``++printf++``...

\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes I've noticed them but they are different from the one we need (they are about using correctly the format string when this one is about security problem if we directly call ``++printf++`` with a string instead of using format strings).

However, we should deal with the RSPECs you are talking about soon.

\[~amelie.renard] if what you are describing is a potential vulnerability, shouldn't this RSPEC be hotspot or vulnerability? I am also wondering if we should target this for Java, PHP?
