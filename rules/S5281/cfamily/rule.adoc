== Why is this an issue?

It is a security vulnerability to call `printf` with a unique string argument that is not a string literal. Indeed, if this argument comes from a user input, this user can:

* make the program crash by executing code equivalent to: ``++printf("%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s")++``
* view the stack or memory at any location by executing code equivalent to: ``++printf("%08x %08x %08x %08x %08x\n")++``

Starting with {cpp}23, `std::print` should be preferred: its arguments are validated at compile-time, making it more secure.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f(char* userInput) {
  printf(userInput); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f(char* userInput) {
  printf("%s", userInput); // Compliant
}
----


== Resources

=== Documentation

* {cpp} reference - https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fprintf[`printf`]

=== Standards

* OWASP - https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack[Format string attack]

=== Related rules

* S2275 - Printf-style format strings should not lead to unexpected behavior at runtime
* S6494 - {cpp} formatting functions should be used instead of C printf-like functions

\[~amelie.renard] we already have RSPEC-3457 and RSPEC-2275 covering ``++printf++``...

\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes I've noticed them but they are different from the one we need (they are about using correctly the format string when this one is about security problem if we directly call ``++printf++`` with a string instead of using format strings).

However, we should deal with the RSPECs you are talking about soon.

\[~amelie.renard] if what you are describing is a potential vulnerability, shouldn't this RSPEC be hotspot or vulnerability? I am also wondering if we should target this for Java, PHP?
