== Why is this an issue?

Classes should only hold ``++weak++`` references to delegate fields with ``++class++`` type. Otherwise, the owning class will have a ``++strong++`` reference to its delegate, and vice versa, and the OS won't be able to deallocate either of them..


Note that this only applies to non-computed delegate fields in classes, and not to fields in ``++struct++``s and ``++enum++``s.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
class MyClass {
  var delegate: ConventionDelegate?  // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,swift]
----
class MyClass {
  weak var delegate: ConventionDelegate?
}
----
