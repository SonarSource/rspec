== Exceptions

This rule is relaxed in the following cases:


----
switch (myVariable) {
  case 0:                                // Empty case used to specify the same behavior for a group of cases.
  case 1:                               
    doSomething();
    break;
  case 2:                                // Use of return statement
    return;
  case 3:                                // Use of throw statement
    throw new IllegalStateException();
  case 4:                                // Use of continue statement
    continue;
  default:                               // For the last case, use of break statement is optional 
    doSomethingElse();
}
