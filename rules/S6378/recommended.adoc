== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Enable the Managed Identities capabilities of this Azure resource. If supported, use a System-Assigned managed identity, as:

* It cannot be shared across resources.
* Its life cycle is deeply tied to the life cycle of its Azure resource.
* It provides a unique independent identity.

Alternatively, User-Assigned Managed Identities can also be used but don't guarantee the properties listed above.
