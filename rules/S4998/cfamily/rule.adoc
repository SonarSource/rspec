== Why is this an issue?

If you use ``++std::unique_ptr<T> const &++`` for a function parameter type, it means that the function will not be able to alter the ownership of the pointed-to object by the ``++unique_ptr++``:

* It cannot acquire ownership of the pointed-to object (this would require a parameter of type ``++std::unique_ptr<T>++``)
* It cannot transfer the object ownership to someone else (this would require a ``++std::unique_ptr<T> &++``).

That means the function can only observe the pointed-to object, and in this case passing a ``++T*++`` (if the ``++unique_ptr++`` can be null) or a ``++T&++`` (if it cannot) provides the same features, while also allowing the function to work with objects that are not handled by a ``++unique_ptr++`` (E.G. objects on the stack, in a ``++vector++``, or in another kind of smart pointer), thus making the function more general-purpose.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
using namespace std;
void draw(unique_ptr<Shape> const &shape); // Noncompliant

void drawAll(vector<unique_ptr<Shape>> v)
{
  for (auto &shape : v) {
      if (shape) {
        draw(shape);
      }
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
using namespace std;
void draw(Shape const &shape); // Compliant

void drawAll(vector<unique_ptr<Shape>> v)
{
  for (auto &shape : v) {
      if (shape) {
        draw(*shape);
      }
  }
}

Replace this use of "unique_ptr" by a raw pointer or a reference (possibly const).

Also, it would be useful to give a "such as" here:

objects that are not handled by a ``++unique_ptr++``

Or to expand a little on the topic in general

\[~loic.joly] it's not clear to me how "will not be able to impact the lifetime of the pointed-to object" is a summary/grouping/superset of the two bullet points that follow it, which is why in my edit I struggled, and then combined the three into a single list.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Lifetime and ownership are deeply linked subject: If A has ownership of B, it means that A is responsible for killing B at some time (at the very least, before its own lifetime ends).

Is the new version clearer?
