A user password should never be stored in clear-text, instead a hash should be produced from it using a secure algorithm:

* not vulnerable to ``++brute force attacks++``.
* not vulnerable to ``++collision attacks++`` (see rule s4790).
* and a salt should be added to the password to lower the risk of ``++rainbow table attacks++`` (see rule s2053).

This rule raises an issue when a password is stored in clear-text or with a hash algorithm vulnerable to ``++bruce force attacks++``. These algorithms, like ``++md5++`` or ``++SHA-family++``  functions are fast to compute the hash and therefore brute force attacks are possible (it's easier to exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords) especially with hardware like GPU, FPGA or ASIC. Modern password hashing algorithms such as ``++bcrypt++``, ``++PBKDF2++`` or ``++argon2++`` are recommended.
