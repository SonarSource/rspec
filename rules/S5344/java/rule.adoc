=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

The following code is vulnerable because it uses a legacy digest-based password
encoding that is not considered secure.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Autowired
public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth, DataSource dataSource) throws Exception {
  auth.jdbcAuthentication()
    .dataSource(dataSource)
    .usersByUsernameQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?")
    .passwordEncoder(new StandardPasswordEncoder()); // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Autowired
public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth, DataSource dataSource) throws Exception {
  auth.jdbcAuthentication()
    .dataSource(dataSource)
    .usersByUsernameQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?")
    .passwordEncoder(new BCryptPasswordEncoder());
}
----

=== How does this work?

include::../common/fix/password-hashing.adoc[]

In the previous example, the ``BCryptPasswordEncoder`` is a password hashing
function in Java that is designed to be secure and resistant to various types
of attacks, including brute-force and rainbow table attacks. It is slow,
adaptative, and automatically implements a salt.
