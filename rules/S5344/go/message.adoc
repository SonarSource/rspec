* Argon2id: "Use strong Argon2id parameters"
* For scrypt: "Use strong scrypt parameters"
* For pbkdf2: "Use at least ``+{min_iterations}+`` PBKDF2 iterations"
** If `hash_name` is `"sha1"`, then min_iterations is 1300000
** If `hash_name` is `"sha256"`, then min_iterations is 600000
** If `hash_name` is `"sha512"`, then min_iterations is 210000
* For bcrypt: "Use at least 10 rounds of bcrypt"
