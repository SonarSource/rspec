==== .NET Core

For `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`:
When `PasswordHasherOptions.IterationCount` is < 100,000:

> Use at least 10 000 iterations here.

When `PasswordHasherOptions.CompatibilityMode` is set to `PasswordHasherCompatibilityMode.IdentityV2`:

> Identity v2 uses only 1000 iterations. Considers changing to identity V3.


For `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation`:
When `KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2` is called with `iterationCount` < 100,000:

> Use at least 100,000 iterations here.

For `System.Security.Cryptography`:

When Rfc2898DeriveBytes is instantiated with an `iterations` parameter < 100,000.
When Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2 is called with an `iterations` parameter < 100,000.

> Use at least 100,000 iterations here.

When Rfc2898DeriveBytes is instantiated without a `hashAlgorithm` parameter.

> Use at least 100,000 iterations and a state-of-the-art digest algorithm here.

=== .NET framework

For `Microsoft.AspNet.Identity`:
When a `PasswordHasher` is instantiated.

> PasswordHasher does not support state-of-the-art parameters. Use Rfc2898DeriveBytes instead.

When Rfc2898DeriveBytes is instantiated with an `iterations` parameter < 100,000.

> Use at least 100,000 iterations here.

When Rfc2898DeriveBytes is instantiated without a `hashAlgorithm` parameter.

> Use at least 100,000 iterations and a state-of-the-art digest algorithm here.

=== BouncyCastle

For `Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Generators.OpenBsdBCrypt`, or `Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Generators.BCrypt`:
When `Generate` is called with cost < 12:

> Use a cost factor of at least 12 here.

For `Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.PbeParametersGenerator`:
When `Init` is called with `iterationCount` < 100,000:

> Use at least 100,000 iterations here.

For `Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Generators.SCrypt`:

* When `Generate` is called with N < 2^12:

> Use a cost factor of at least 2^12 for N here.

* When `Generate` is called with r < 8:

> Use a memory factor of at least 8 for r here.

* When `Generate` is called with dkLen < 32:

> Use an output length of at least 32 for dkLen here.
