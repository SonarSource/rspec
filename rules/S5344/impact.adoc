=== What is the potential impact?

Plaintext or weakly hashed password storage poses a significant security risk
to software applications.

==== Unauthorized Access

When passwords are stored in plaintext or with weak hashing algorithms, an
attacker who gains access to the password database can easily retrieve and use
the passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This can lead to
various malicious activities, such as unauthorized data access, identity theft,
or even financial fraud.

==== Credential Reuse

Many users tend to reuse passwords across multiple platforms. If an attacker
obtains plaintext or weakly hashed passwords, they can potentially use these
credentials to gain unauthorized access to other accounts held by the same
user. This can have far-reaching consequences, as sensitive personal
information or critical systems may be compromised.

==== Regulatory Compliance

Many industries and jurisdictions have specific regulations and standards to
protect user data and ensure its confidentiality. Storing passwords in
plaintext or with weak hashing algorithms can lead to non-compliance with
these regulations, potentially resulting in legal consequences, financial
penalties, and damage to the reputation of the software application and its
developers.
