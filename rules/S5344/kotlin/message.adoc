* For PBKDF2: "Use at least ``+{min_iterations}+`` PBKDF2 iterations"
** If `algorithm` is `"PBKDF2withHmacSHA1"`, then min_iterations is 1,300,000
** If `algorithm` is `"PBKDF2withHmacSHA256"`, then min_iterations is 600,000
** If `algorithm` is `"PBKDF2withHmacSHA512"`, then min_iterations is 210,000
