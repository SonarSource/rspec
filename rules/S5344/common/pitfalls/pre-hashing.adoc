==== Pre-hashing passwords

As bcrypt has a maximum length input length of 72 bytes for most
implementations, some developers may be tempted to pre-hash the password with a
stronger algorithm before hashing it with bcrypt.

Pre-hashing passwords with bcrypt is not recommended as it can lead to
a specific range of issues. Using a strong salt and a high number of rounds is
enough to protect the password.
