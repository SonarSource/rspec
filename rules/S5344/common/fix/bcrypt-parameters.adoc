==== Select the correct Bcrypt parameters

When bcrypt's hashing function is used, it is important to select a round count
that is high enough to make the function slow enough to prevent brute force:
More than 12 rounds.

For bcrypt's key derivation function, the number of rounds should likewise be
high enough to make the function slow enough to prevent brute force: More than
4096 rounds `+(2^12)+`. +
This number is not the same coefficient as the first one because it uses
a different algorithm.
