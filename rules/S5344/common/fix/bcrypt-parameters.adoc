==== Select the correct Bcrypt parameters

If bcrypt must be used, the default values of bcrypt are considered secure.

For password hashing functions, the library uses 12 hashing rounds. However, if
you want to be extra careful, you can increase the number of rounds to 14 or
15. It is important that this number is greater than 10 rounds.

Next, more than 50 rounds should be used for bcrypt's key derivation function.
This number is not the same coefficient as the first one because the `kdf()`
function uses a different algorithm.
