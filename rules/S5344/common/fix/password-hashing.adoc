==== Use specific password hashing algorithms

In general, relying on an algorithm with no known weaknesses is also
a requirement. This prevents the use of the MD5 or SHA-1 algorithms.

While considered strong for some use cases, some algorithms, like SHA-family
functions, are too fast to compute and therefore susceptible to brute force
attacks, especially with attack-dedicated hardware. Modern, slow, password
hashing algorithms such as bcrypt, PBKDF2 or argon2 are recommended.
