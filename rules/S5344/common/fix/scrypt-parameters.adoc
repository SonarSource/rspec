==== Select the correct Scrypt parameters

If scrypt must be used, the default values of scrypt are considered secure.

Like Argon2id, scrypt has three different parameters that can be configured: the
minimum CPU/memory cost parameter (N), the blocksize (r) and the degree of
parallelism (p).

The higher the values of m, t and p, the safer it is, but it should be tolerable
for the application.

// Write a way to select the safe values afterwards in the language-specific
// file. See the example in the Python file.
