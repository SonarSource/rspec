==== Select the correct Argon parameters

In general, the default values of the Argon library are considered safe. If you
need to change the parameters, you should note the following:

First, argon2 comes in three forms: `Argon2i`, `Argon2d` and `Argon2id`.
`Argon2i` is optimized for hashing passwords and uses data-independent memory
access. argon2d`` is faster and uses data-dependent memory access, making it
suitable for applications where there is no risk of side-channel attacks. +
`Argon2id` is a mixture of `argon2i` and `argon2d` and is recommended for most applications.

Argon2id has three different parameters that can be configured: the basic
minimum memory size (m), the minimum number of iterations (t) and the degree of
parallelism (p). +
The higher the values of m, t and p, the safer it is, but it should be tolerable
for the application.

// Write a way to select the safe values afterwards in the language-specific
// file. See the example in the Python file.
