==== Select the correct Argon2 parameters

In general, the default values of the Argon2 library are considered safe. If you
need to change the parameters, you should note the following:

First, Argon2 comes in three forms: `Argon2i`, `Argon2d` and `Argon2id`.
`Argon2i` is optimized for hashing passwords and uses data-independent memory
access. `Argon2d` is faster and uses data-dependent memory access, making it
suitable for applications where there is no risk of side-channel attacks. +
`Argon2id` is a mixture of `Argon2i` and `Argon2d` and is recommended for most applications.

Argon2id has three different parameters that can be configured: the basic
minimum memory size (m), the minimum number of iterations (t) and the degree of
parallelism (p). +
The higher the values of m, t and p, the safer it is, but longer execution times can
lead to a worse user experience. There exist general recommendations that balance
security and speed in an optimal way.

If you need to select a hash length, the recommended value is 32 bytes. +
If you need to select a salt length, the recommended value is 16 bytes.

Next, the recommended parameters for Argon2id are:
