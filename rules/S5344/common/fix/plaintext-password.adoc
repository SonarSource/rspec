==== Never store passwords in cleartext

A user password should never be stored in clear text. Instead, a hash should be
produced from it using a secure algorithm. When dealing with password storage
security, best practices recommend relying on a slow hashing algorithm, that
will make brute force attacks more difficult. Using a hashing function with
adaptable computation and memory complexity also is recommended to be able to
increase the security level with time.

Adding a salt to the digest computation is also recommended to prevent
pre-computed table attacks (see rule S2053).
