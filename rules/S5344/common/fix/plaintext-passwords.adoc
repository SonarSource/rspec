A user password should never be stored in clear text. Instead, a hash should be produced from it using a secure algorithm. When dealing with password storage security, best practices recommend relying on a slow hashing algorithm, that will make brute force attacks more difficult. Using a hashing function with adaptable computation and memory complexity also is recommended to be able to increase the security level with time.

Adding a salt to the digest computation is also recommended to prevent pre-computed table attacks (see rule S2053).

In general, relying on an algorithm with no known weaknesses is also a requirement. This prevents the use of the MD5 or SHA-1 algorithms.

While considered strong for some use cases, some algorithms, like SHA-family functions, are too fast to compute and therefore susceptible to brute force attacks, especially with attack-dedicated hardware. Modern, slow, password hashing algorithms such as bcrypt, PBKDF2 or argon2 are recommended.
