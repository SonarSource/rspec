==== Select the correct PBKDF2 parameters

If PBKDF2 must be used, be aware that default values might not be considered
secure. +
Depending on the algorithm used, the number of iterations should be adjusted to
ensure that the derived key is secure. The following are the recommended number
of iterations for PBKDF2:

* PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1: 1,300,000 iterations
* PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: 600,000 iterations
* PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512: 210,000 iterations

Note that PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 is recommended by NIST. +
Iterations are also called "rounds" depending on the library used.

When recommended cost factors are too high in the context of the application or
if the performance cost is unacceptable, a cost factor reduction might be
considered. In that case, it should not be chosen under 100,000.
