==== Pepper

In a defense-in-depth security approach, **peppering** can also be used. This is
a security technique where an external secret value is added to a password
before it is hashed. +
This makes it more difficult for an attacker to crack the hashed passwords, as
they would need to know the secret value to generate the correct hash. +
