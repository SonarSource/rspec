== Why is this an issue?

It's confusing to have a class field with the same name as a method in the class. It's also confusing to have multiple fields that differ only in capitalization


Typically this situation indicates poor naming. Method names should be action-oriented, and thus contain a verb, which is unlikely in the case where both a method and a member have the same name. However, renaming a public method could be disruptive to callers. Therefore renaming the member is the recommended action.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
public class Foo {

  public static final String QUERY = "Select name from person";
  private String query;  // Noncompliant
  public String query() { // Noncompliant
    // do something...
  }

  private void doSomething() {

    String tmp = query; // is this what was intended? Should this have been a call to query()?

  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
public class Foo {

  public static final String NAME_QUERY = "Select name from person";
  private String queryString; // member has been renamed
  public String query() { 
    // do something...
  }

  private void doSomething() {

    String tmp = query; // results in a compile error
    String tmp2 = query(); // no question now what was intended
  }
}
