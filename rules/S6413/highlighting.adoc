=== Highlighting

* Highlight the resource if the configuration block is missing
* Highlight the configuration block if the setting in the block is missing
* Highlight the configuration value if it is too low

Those highlights only apply if the specification says an issue should be raised. For example, in many cases it is valid to not specify the setting at all.
