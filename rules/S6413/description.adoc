Defining a short log retention duration can reduce an organization's ability to backtrace the actions of malicious actors in case of a security incident.

Logging allows operational and security teams to get detailed and real-time feedback on an information systemâ€™s events. The logging coverage enables them to quickly react to events, ranging from the most benign bugs to the most impactful security incidents, such as intrusions.

Apart from security detection, logging capabilities also directly influence future digital forensic analyses. For example, detailed logging will allow investigators to establish a timeline of the actions perpetrated by an attacker.
