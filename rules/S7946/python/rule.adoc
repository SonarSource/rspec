This rule raises an issue when f-strings or string concatenation are used in logging statements.

== Why is this an issue?

Using f-strings and string concatenation in logging statements creates
unnecessary performance overhead. When you use f-strings or string concatenation,
Python evaluates and formats the string immediately, regardless of whether
the log message will actually be written based on the current logging level.

This means that if your application has debug-level logging statements with
f-strings, but the logging level is set to WARNING or higher, Python will
still spend CPU cycles formatting those strings even though they will never
be displayed or written to logs.

Python's logging module uses lazy evaluation with its built-in string formatting.
When you pass format strings and arguments separately to logging methods,
the string formatting only occurs if the log message passes the level filter.
This can provide significant performance benefits, especially in applications
with many debug statements or high-frequency logging.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using f-strings and string concatenation in logging can lead to:

* **Performance degradation**: String formatting occurs unconditionally, even when log messages are filtered out by level
* **CPU waste**: Applications with extensive debug logging may spend significant time formatting unused strings
* **Scalability issues**: In high-throughput applications, the cumulative effect of unnecessary string formatting can impact overall performance
* **Memory overhead**: Intermediate string objects are created even when the log message won't be used

=== How to fix?

Replace custom formatters with Python's built-in string formatting in logging calls. Use format specifiers directly in the logging methods.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import logging

def log(action, amount, item):
  logging.info(f"User {action}: {amount:.2f} {item}")  # Noncompliant: using f-string formatting

----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import logging

def log(action, amount, item):
  logging.info("User %s: %.2f %s", action, amount, item)
