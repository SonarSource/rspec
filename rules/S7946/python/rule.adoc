This rule raises an issue when custom formatters are defined for logging purposes.

== Why is this an issue?

Creating custom in-line formatting for logging introduces unnecessary
complexity and increases the risk of developer errors. When developers define
their own formatters, they must remember to apply them consistently
throughout the codebase. This manual step is error-prone and can lead to:

* Forgotten formatter calls, resulting in malformed log messages
* Inconsistent logging formats across the application  
* Additional maintenance overhead for custom code
* Potential runtime errors if formatters are not applied correctly

Python's logging module provides robust, well-tested formatting capabilities
that handle edge cases and provide consistent behavior. These built-in features
are designed to be reliable and are familiar to most Python developers.

Using standard logging practices also improves code readability and maintainability, as other developers can immediately understand the logging approach without learning custom formatting logic.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using custom formatters instead of built-in logging capabilities can lead to:

* **Reliability issues**: Forgotten formatter calls result in broken or malformed log messages
* **Debugging difficulties**: Inconsistent logging makes troubleshooting harder
* **Maintenance burden**: Custom code requires ongoing maintenance and testing
* **Team productivity**: New team members need to learn custom formatting approaches

=== How to fix?


Replace custom formatters with Python's built-in string formatting in logging calls. Use format specifiers directly in the logging methods.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import logging

def log(action, amount, item):
  logging.info(f"User {action}: {amount:.2f} {item}")  # Noncompliant: using f-string formatting

----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import logging

def log(action, amount, item):
  logging.info("User %s: %.2f %s", action, amount, item)
----
