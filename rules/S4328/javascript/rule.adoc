== Why is this an issue?

Dependencies should be explicitly listed in the ``++package.json++`` file. Importing a module that is not declared as a dependency makes it an implicit one and is bound to create problems. For example, a code might depend on a module that is present in ``++node_modules++`` as a transitive dependency; this dependency could be updated or removed without you noticing that, which could make your code fail.
