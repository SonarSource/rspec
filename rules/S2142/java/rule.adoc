== Why is this an issue?

If an `InterruptedException` or a `ThreadDeath` error is not handled properly, the information that the thread was interrupted will be lost.
Handling this exception means either to re-throw it, or manually re-interrupt the current thread by calling `Thread.interrupt()`.
Simply logging the exception is not sufficient and counts as ignoring it.
Between the moment the exception is caught and handled, is the right time to perform cleanup operations on the method's state, if needed.

=== What is the potential impact?

Failing to interrupt the thread (or to re-throw) risks delaying the thread shutdown and loses the information that the thread was interrupted - probably without finishing its task.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public void run () {
  try {
    /*...*/
  } catch (InterruptedException e) { // Noncompliant; logging is not enough
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public void run () {
  try {
    /* ... */
  } catch (InterruptedException e) { // Compliant; the interrupted state is restored
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
    /* Clean up whatever needs to be handled before interrupting  */
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
  }
}

public void run () {
  try {
    /* ... */
  } catch (ThreadDeath e) { // Compliant; the error is being re-thrown
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
    /* Clean up whatever needs to be handled before re-throwing  */
    throw e;
  }
}

@Ann, could you provide the source of this RSPEC because would like to double-check the main goal of this rule ? For sure here the code snippets are really misleading because we could have the feeling that when the execution of a Runnable class is interrupted, this exception can be caught in the `run` method which is not at all the case.

Hi,


I think the rule derived from this spec is too narrow.

 Many people write `catch (Exception e)` in their applications.


Following this spec, IMO, that means that any `catch(Exception e)` must ALWAYS be preceded by a catch of InterruptedException like this

----
catch (InterruptedException e) {
  Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
} catch (Exception e) {
  //...
}{code}
