@Ann, could you provide the source of this RSPEC because would like to double-check the main goal of this rule ? For sure here the code snippets are really misleading because we could have the feeling that when the execution of a Runnable class is interrupted, this exception can be caught in the ``++run++`` method which is not at all the case.

Hi,


I think the rule derived from this spec is too narrow.

 Many people write ``++catch (Exception e)++`` in their applications.


Following this spec, IMO, that means that any ``++catch(Exception e)++`` must ALWAYS be preceded by a catch of InterruptedException like this

----
catch (InterruptedException e) {
  Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
} catch (Exception e) {
  //...
}{code}
