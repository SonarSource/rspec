== Why is this an issue?

Inexperienced Java developers might expect the ``++Object.equals(Object obj)++`` method to correctly handle the case where the left hand side is null, but that is not the case.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
if (variable.equals(null)) { /* ... */ }   // Noncompliant - "variable" is really null, a NullPointerException is thrown
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
if (variable == null) { /* ... */ }        // Compliant
----
