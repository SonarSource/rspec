== Why is this an issue?

----
#define ASPECT_RATIO 1.653;       //Noncompliant
const float ASPECT_RATIO = 1.653;  //Compliant

#define max(a, b) ((a<b) ? b : a)      //Noncompliant
inline int max(int a, int b) {return((a < b) ? b : a);}    //Compliant

#ifnef __MY_FILE_H__
#define __MY_FILE_H__    //Compliant : header file multiple
                                                    //inclusion detection
...

#endif  //end of file MyFile.h

Syntax verifications are better done by the compiler than by the preprocessor.
