``++volatile++`` can be used to qualify many objects in C and {cpp}, but only a few of the possible places have a well-defined meaning (global variables and local variables for instance).
There is no well-defined meaning to the use of volatile to qualify a function return type, a function parameter. 
Furthermore for the structured-binding the volatile qualifier appertains to the decomposed object, that cannot be referred.
Since {cpp}20, these uses are deprecated, but even before you should not use volatile in those places.

This rule raises issue for a volatile qualified function return type, function parameter, and structured binding (available in {cpp} only since {cpp}17).

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int volatile f(int volatile i); // Noncompliant, both for the return type and the parameter

void g() {
  auto volatile [a, b] = getPair(); // Noncompliant
}
