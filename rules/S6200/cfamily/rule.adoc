== Why is this an issue?

``++volatile++`` can be used to qualify many objects in C and {cpp}, but only a few of the possible places have a well-defined meaning (global variables and local variables, for instance).
There is no well-defined meaning to the use of volatile to qualify a function return type or a function parameter.
Furthermore, for structured bindings, the volatile qualifier appertains to the decomposed object, which cannot be referred to.
Since {cpp}20, these uses are deprecated, but even before you should not use volatile in those places.

This rule raises an issue for a volatile qualified function return type, function parameter, and structured binding (available in {cpp} since {cpp}17).

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int volatile f(int volatile i); // Noncompliant, both for the return type and the parameter

void g() {
  auto volatile [a, b] = getPair(); // Noncompliant
}
----
