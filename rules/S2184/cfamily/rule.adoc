== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void nonCompliant ( ) {
  float twoThirds = 2 / 3;
  long millisInYear = 1000 * 3600 * 24 * 365;
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void compliant1() {
  float twoThirds = 2.F / 3;
  long millisInYear = 1000L * 3600 * 24 * 365;
}
----
or

[source,cpp]
----
void compliant2() {
  float twoThirds = ((float) 2) / 3;
  long millisInYear = ((long) 1000) * 3600 * 24 * 365;
}
