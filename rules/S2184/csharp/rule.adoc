When division is performed on ``++int++``s, the result will always be an ``++int++``. You can assign that result to a ``++double++``, ``++float++`` or ``++decimal++`` with automatic type conversion, but having started as an ``++int++``, the result will likely not be what you expect. If the result of ``++int++`` division is assigned to a floating-point variable, precision will have been lost before the assignment. Instead, at least one operand should be cast or promoted to the final type before the operation takes place.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
static void Main()
{
  decimal dec = 3/2; // Noncompliant
  Method(3/2); // Noncompliant
}

static void Method(float f) { }
----

== Compliant Solution

----
static void Main()
{
  decimal dec = (decimal)3/2;
  Method(3.0F/2);
}

static void Method(float f) { }
