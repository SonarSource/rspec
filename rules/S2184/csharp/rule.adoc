When division is performed on ``int``s, the result will always be an ``int``. You can assign that result to a ``double``, ``float`` or ``decimal`` with automatic type conversion, but having started as an ``int``, the result will likely not be what you expect. If the result of ``int`` division is assigned to a floating-point variable, precision will have been lost before the assignment. Instead, at least one operand should be cast or promoted to the final type before the operation takes place.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
static void Main()
{
  decimal dec = 3/2; // Noncompliant
  Method(3/2); // Noncompliant
}

static void Method(float f) { }
----

== Compliant Solution

----
static void Main()
{
  decimal dec = (decimal)3/2;
  Method(3.0F/2);
}

static void Method(float f) { }
