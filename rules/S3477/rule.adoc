== Why is this an issue?

If a ``++RuntimeException++`` is thrown while code is unit tested, it's likely to be thrown again in production. Therefore, test methods should be allowed to ``++throw RuntimeException++``s so you're alerted early to problems in the code.

@Test
public void testTheThing() {
  try {
    // ...
  } catch (RuntimeException e) {  // Noncompliant 
    // ...
  }
}
