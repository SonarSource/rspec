<p>The real need for bit fields is narrow and highly specialized. Previously, they were used to save memory, but that&#8217;s less a concern in modern systems than are the extra instructions required to interact with them. Today, they may be needed in direct hardware interaction, but since their behavior is platform-dependent, getting them right can be tricky, and since their use is increasingly rare these days, they&#8217;re likely to confuse maintainers. For these reasons, it&#8217;s simpler and more performant to use another field type instead of bit fields.</p>

<p>I have feeling that at least should not be activated by default, because likely will generate a lot of issues, which might be not easily fixable, especially for projects with long evolution history, which is quite common in C world.</p>

<p>Active and Critical because there seems to be little justification for bit fields. But I&#8217;ve marked it inactive.</p>
