=== What is the potential impact?

Public fields can be modified by any part of the code and this can lead to unexpected changes and hard-to-trace bugs.

Public fields don't hide the implementation details. As a consequence, it is no longer possible to change how the data is stored internally without impacting the client code of the class.

The code is harder to maintain.
