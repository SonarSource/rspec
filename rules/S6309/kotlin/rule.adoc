There are two ways to define asynchronous functions in Kotlin:

* using the modifier `suspend` in the function declaration
* creating an extension function on `CoroutineScope`

The `suspend` modifier is generally used for functions that might take some time to complete. The caller coroutine might potentially be suspended.

Functions that start a coroutine in the background and return before said coroutine has completed running should be extension functions on `CoroutineScope`. This helps to clarify the intention of such a function. Further, such functions should not be suspending, as suspending functions should only return once all the work they are designed to perform is complete.

Functions returning `Flow` or `Channel` should return the result immediately and may start a new coroutine in the background. As a consequence, such functions should not be suspending and if they launch a coroutine in the background, they should be declared as extension functions on `CoroutineScope`.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
suspend fun f(): Flow<Int> {
    val flow = flow {
        emit(1)
    }
    delay(500L)
    return flow
}
----

----
suspend fun f(): Channel<Int> {
    val ch = Channel<Int>()
    ch.send(1)
    return ch
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
fun f(): Flow<Int> = flow {
    emit(1)
}
----

----
fun CoroutineScope.f(): Channel<Int> {
    val ch = Channel<Int>()
    launch {
        ch.send(1)
    }
    return ch
}
