Each constructor must first invoke a parent class constructor, but it doesn't always have to be done explicitly. If the parent class has a reachable, no-args constructor, a call to it will be inserted automatically by the compiler. Thus, calls to ``++super()++`` can be omitted. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyClass {
  private Foo foo;

  public MyClass (Foo foo) {
    super(); // Noncompliant
    this.foo = foo;
  }
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public class MyClass {
  private Foo foo;

  public MyClass (Foo foo) {
    this.foo = foo;
  }
