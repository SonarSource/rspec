== Why is this an issue?

Each constructor must first invoke a parent class constructor, but it doesn't always have to be done explicitly. If the parent class has a reachable, no-args constructor, a call to it will be inserted automatically by the compiler. Thus, calls to ``++super()++`` can be omitted. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
  private Foo foo;

  public MyClass (Foo foo) {
    super(); // Noncompliant
    this.foo = foo;
  }
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
  private Foo foo;

  public MyClass (Foo foo) {
    this.foo = foo;
  }
----
