== Why is this an issue?

Manipulation of character data may generate results that are contrary to developer expectations. For example, ISO/IEC 14882:2003 §2.2(3) only requires that the digits "0" to "9" have consecutive numerical values.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
char_t ch = 't'; // Compliant
uint8_t v;
if ( ( ch >= 'a' ) && ( ch <= 'z' ) ) // Noncompliant
{
}
if ( ( ch >= '0' ) && ( ch <= '9' ) ) // Compliant by exception
{
  v = ch - '0'; // Compliant by exception
  v = ch - '1'; // Noncompliant
}
ch = '0' + v; // Compliant by exception
ch = 'A' + v; // Noncompliant
----


=== Exceptions

Exceptionally, the following operators may be used if the associated restriction is observed:

* The binary + operator may be used to add an integral value in the range 0 to 9 to '0';
* The binary - operator may be used to subtract character '0';
* The relational operators <, +<=+, >, >= may be used to determine if a character (or wide 
character) represents a digit.


== Resources

* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 4-5-3 - Expressions with type (plain) char and wchar_t shall not be used as operands to built-in operators other than the assignment operator =, the equality operators == and !=, and the unary & operator.
* ISO/IEC 14882:2003 §2.2(3)
