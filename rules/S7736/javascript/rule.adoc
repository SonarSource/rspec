This rule raises an issue when a negated expression is directly compared using equality operators (`===`, `!==`, `==`, `!=`).

== Why is this an issue?

Using a negated expression in an equality check is almost always a logical error that leads to unexpected behavior.

When you write `!foo === bar`, JavaScript parses this as `(!foo) === bar` due to operator precedence. This compares the boolean result of `!foo` with the value of `bar`, which is rarely the intended logic.

For example, if `foo` is `"hello"` and `bar` is `"world"`, then `!foo === bar` becomes `false === "world"`, which evaluates to `false`. This is likely not what you wanted to check.

This pattern usually occurs when developers:

* Intend to write `foo !== bar` but accidentally add the negation operator
* Want to negate the entire comparison but forget the parentheses: `!(foo === bar)`
* Misunderstand JavaScript's operator precedence rules

These mistakes can cause conditional statements to behave incorrectly, leading to bugs that are difficult to spot during code review.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue can cause logical errors in your application's control flow. Conditional statements may not work as expected, potentially leading to:

* Incorrect branching in if-else statements
* Unexpected behavior in loops and filters
* Security vulnerabilities if the faulty logic affects authentication or authorization checks
* Data corruption if the logic controls data processing operations

=== How to fix?


Replace the negated equality check with the correct inequality operator. Use `!==` instead of `!expression ===` and `===` instead of `!expression !==`.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (!foo === bar) { // Noncompliant
  // This compares (!foo) with bar
  doSomething();
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (foo !== bar) {
  // This correctly checks if foo is not equal to bar
  doSomething();
}
