== Why is this an issue?

Functions with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as maintainers must figure out the role of each parameter and keep track of their position.

include::{noncompliant}[]

The solution can be to:

* Split the function into smaller ones

include::{split-example}[]

* Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain

include::{struct-example}[]

This rule raises an issue when a function has more parameters than the maximum authorized number of parameters.
