== Why is this an issue?

{upper_function}s with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as maintainers must figure out the role of each parameter and keep track of their position.

The solution can be to:

* Split the {function} into smaller ones

include::{language}/split-example.adoc[]

* Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain

include::{language}/struct-example.adoc[]

This rule raises an issue when a {function} has more parameters than the provided threshold.
