== Why is this an issue?

Procedures with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as maintainers must figure out the role of each parameter and keep track of their position.

[source,vbnet]
----
Sub SetCoordinates(x1 As Integer, y1 As Integer, z1 As Integer, x2 As Integer, y2 As Integer, z2 As Integer) ' Noncompliant
    ' ...
End Sub
----

The solution can be to:

* Split the procedure into smaller ones

[source,vbnet]
----
' Each function does a part of what the original setCoordinates function was doing, so confusion risks are lower
Sub SetOrigin(x As Integer, y As Integer, z As Integer)
   ' ...
End Sub

Sub SetSize(width As Integer, height As Integer, depth As Integer)
   ' ...
End Sub
----

* Find a better data structure for the parameters

[source,vbnet]
----
Class Point ' In geometry, Point is a logical structure to group data

    Public x As Integer
    Public y As Integer
    Public z As Integer

End Class

Sub SetCoordinates(p1 As Point, p2 As Point)
    ' ...
End Sub
----

This rule raises an issue when a procedure has more parameters than the provided threshold.

=== Exceptions

The rule does not count the parameters intended for a base class constructor.

With a maximum number of 4 parameters:

[source,vbnet]
----
Class BaseClass

    Sub New(Param1 As Integer)
        ' ...
    End Sub

End Class

Class DerivedClass
    Inherits BaseClass

    Public Sub New(Param1 As Integer, Param2 As Integer, Param3 As Integer, Param4 As Integer, Param5 As Long)
        MyBase.New(Param1) ' Compliant by exception
        ' ...
    End Sub

End Class
