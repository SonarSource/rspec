== Why is this an issue?

Functions or procedures with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as one must figure out the role of each parameter.

[source,tsql]
----
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SetCoordinates
    @x1 INT,
    @y1 INT,
    @z1 INT,
    @x2 INT,
    @y2 INT,
    @z2 INT
AS
BEGIN
    -- ...
END;
----


The solution can be to:

* Split the function or the procedure into smaller ones

[source,tsql]
----
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SetOrigin
(
    @x INT,
    @y INT,
    @z INT
)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @x
END
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SetSize
(
    @width  INT,
    @height INT,
    @depth  INT
)
AS
BEGIN
     SELECT @width
END
GO
----

* Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain

[source,tsql]
----
CREATE TYPE dbo.Point AS TABLE
(
	Id	INT,
    X	INT,
    Y	INT,
    Z	INT
);
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SetCoordinates
    @Points dbo.Point READONLY
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @x1 AS INT, @y1 AS INT, @z1 AS INT
    DECLARE @x2 AS INT, @y2 AS INT, @z2 AS INT

    SELECT @x1 = X, @y1 = Y, @z1 = Z FROM @Points ORDER BY Id OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY
    SELECT @x2 = X, @y2 = Y, @z2 = Z FROM @Points ORDER BY Id OFFSET 1 ROWS FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY

    -- ...
END;
GO
----

This rule raises an issue when a function or a procedure has more parameters than the provided threshold.
