== Why is this an issue?

Procedures with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as one must figure out the role of each parameter.

The solution can be to:

* Split the procedure into smaller ones
* Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain

This rule raises an issue when a procedure has more parameters than the given number.
