== Why is this an issue?

Methods with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as maintainers must figure out the role of each parameter and keep track of their position.

[source,java]
----
void setCoordinates(int x1, int y1, int z1, int x2, int y2, int z2) { // Noncompliant
    // ...
}
----

The solution can be to:

* Split the method into smaller ones

[source,java]
----
// Each function does a part of what the original setCoordinates function was doing, so confusion risks are lower
void setOrigin(int x, int y, int z) {
   // ...
}

void setSize(int width, int height, int depth) {
   // ...
}
----

* Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain

[source,java]
----
class Point // In geometry, Point is a logical structure to group data
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
    public int z;
 };

void setCoordinates(Point p1, Point p2) {
    // ...
}
----

This rule raises an issue when a method has more parameters than the provided threshold.

=== Exceptions

Methods annotated with :

* Spring's ``++@RequestMapping++`` (and related shortcut annotations, like ``++@GetRequest++``)
* JAX-RS API annotations (like ``++@javax.ws.rs.GET++``)
* Bean constructor injection with ``++@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired++``
* CDI constructor injection with ``++@javax.inject.Inject++``
* ``++@com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator++``
* Micronaut's annotations (like ``++@io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get++``)

may have a lot of parameters, encapsulation being possible. Therefore the rule ignores such methods.

Also, if a class annotated as a Spring component (like ``++@org.springframework.stereotype.Component++``) has a single
constructor, that constructor will be considered ``++@Autowired++`` and ignored by the rule.

!RequestMapping Annotation Not Ignored.png!


Hi,

I have been using the SonarJava 5.8 updated plugin and I still see RequestMapping annotation is not being ignored by SonarQube. Attached is the image of code snippet(sorry I have to hide the names due to the company policies). Can someone tell me how to make it work?

Thanks
