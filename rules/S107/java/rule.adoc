=== Exceptions

Methods annotated with :

* Spring's ``++@RequestMapping++`` (and related shortcut annotations, like ``++@GetRequest++``)
* JAX-RS API annotations (like ``++@javax.ws.rs.GET++``)
* Bean constructor injection with ``++@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired++``
* CDI constructor injection with ``++@javax.inject.Inject++``
* ``++@com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator++``
* Micronaut's annotations (like ``++@io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get++``)

may have a lot of parameters, encapsulation being possible. Therefore the rule ignores such methods.

Also, if a class annotated as a Spring component (like ``++@org.springframework.stereotype.Component++``) has a single
constructor, that constructor will be considered ``++@Autowired++`` and ignored by the rule.

!RequestMapping Annotation Not Ignored.png!


Hi,

I have been using the SonarJava 5.8 updated plugin and I still see RequestMapping annotation is not being ignored by SonarQube. Attached is the image of code snippet(sorry I have to hide the names due to the company policies). Can someone tell me how to make it work?

Thanks
