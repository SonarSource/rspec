!RequestMapping Annotation Not Ignored.png!


Hi, 

I have been using the SonarJava 5.8 updated plugin and I still see RequestMapping annotation is not being ignored by SonarQube. Attached is the image of code snippet(sorry I have to hide the names due to the company policies). Can someone tell me how to make it work?  

Thanks
