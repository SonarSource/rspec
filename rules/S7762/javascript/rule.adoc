This rule raises an issue when `parentNode.removeChild(childNode)` is used instead of the more direct `childNode.remove()` method.

== Why is this an issue?

The traditional way to remove a DOM element in JavaScript was to call `parentNode.removeChild(childNode)`. This approach requires you to first access the parent node, then call `removeChild` with the child node as an argument.

Modern browsers support the `remove()` method directly on DOM nodes, which provides a cleaner and more intuitive API. Using `childNode.remove()` is simpler because:

* It requires less code and fewer method calls
* It's more readable and expresses the intent more clearly
* It eliminates the need to access the parent node
* It follows modern JavaScript patterns

The `remove()` method has been widely supported across browsers for many years and is the recommended approach for removing DOM elements.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using the older `removeChild` pattern makes code more verbose and harder to read. While functionally equivalent, the modern `remove()` method improves code maintainability and follows current best practices for DOM manipulation.

=== How to fix?


Replace `parentNode.removeChild(childNode)` with `childNode.remove()`. This directly removes the element without needing to access its parent.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
parentNode.removeChild(foo); // Noncompliant
parentNode.removeChild(this); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
foo.remove();
this.remove();
