HTML5 introduces the ability to restrict the permissions of content loaded into an ``++iframe++``. Simply adding the ``++sandbox++`` attribute to an ``++iframe++`` tag limits the ``++iframe++`` to simply loading the specified contents; no scripts will run, no popups will pop, and so on. You can re-enable additional functions individually by specifying them in the attribute's value:

* ``++allow-forms++`` - form submission
* ``++allow-popups++`` - popups
* ``++allow-scripts++`` - script execution
* ``++allow-pointer-lock++`` - access to the "pointer lock" API
* ``++allow-same-origin++`` - sandboxed content is marked as being from a different domain (even when it's not). This attribute turns that off so that, for instance, the ``++iframe++`` content can access its site's cookies.
* ``++allow-top-navigation++`` - turns the ``++target++`` attribute of ``++a++`` tags back on

Following the principle of minimum privileges, this rule raises an issue for each ``++iframe++`` which does not have a ``++sandbox++`` attribute.
