An issue is raised when a string literal contains escaped backslashes (`\\`) that could be simplified using `String.raw` template literals.

== Why is this an issue?

String literals with escaped backslashes can be difficult to read and maintain. Each backslash character must be escaped with another backslash, creating sequences like `\\` that are hard to interpret at a glance.

This problem is particularly common when working with:

* File paths on Windows systems
* Regular expression patterns
* LaTeX or other markup that uses backslashes
* Any string content that naturally contains backslash characters

The `String.raw` template literal provides a cleaner alternative. It treats backslashes literally without requiring escaping, making the code more readable and less error-prone. The intent becomes clearer, and there's less chance of accidentally missing or adding extra backslashes during maintenance.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using escaped backslashes instead of `String.raw` reduces code readability and increases the likelihood of errors when maintaining string literals. While this doesn't cause runtime issues, it makes the codebase harder to understand and modify correctly.

=== How to fix?


Replace string literals containing escaped backslashes with `String.raw` template literals. The backslashes inside the template literal don't need to be escaped.

----
const filePath = "C:\\Users\\Documents\\file.txt"; // Noncompliant

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const filePath = String.raw`C:\Users\Documents\file.txt`;
