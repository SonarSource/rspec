Instead of repeating prototypes in each module that uses a procedure, you should declare them in a ``++/COPY++`` member and simply include that member as appropriate. This keeps you from having to repeat the prototype over and over, which reduces the chance of errors, and makes maintenance easier if you ever need to update the prototype.
