Calling ``++DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES++`` won't reliably do any good if the table hasn't first been sorted to put duplicates side by side, since the ``++ADJACENT++`` part of the command looks for multiple rows side-by-side with the same content.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM ITAB COMPARING LAND.
