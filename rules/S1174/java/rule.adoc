== Why is this an issue?

The contract of the ``++Object.finalize()++`` method is clear: only the Garbage Collector is supposed to call this method.

Making this method public is misleading, because it implies that any caller can use it.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {

  @Override
  public void finalize() {    // Noncompliant
    /* ... */
  }
}
----
