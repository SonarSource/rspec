== Why is this an issue?

The ``++Object.finalize()++`` method is a special method defined in the Object class in Java.
It is called by the Garbage Collector when it determines that there are no more references to an object
and the object is about to be garbage collected.
By default, the ``++finalize()++`` method in the Object class is defined as protected.

When overriding the ``++finalize()++`` method in your own classes, it is generally recommended to keep the access level
as protected rather than making it public.
Making this method public is misleading, as it implies that any caller can use it.

== How to fix it

Make ``++finalize()++`` method protected.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyClass {

  @Override
  public void finalize() {    // Noncompliant
    /* ... */
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyClass {

  @Override
  protected void finalize() {    // Compliant
    /* ... */
  }
}
----

This rule overlap with:

We believe this rule is not interesting anymore for users on java >= 9. It can still be useful for users using Java < 9, so we decided to keep it for now, but you should expect it to be deprecated in the mid-term.
