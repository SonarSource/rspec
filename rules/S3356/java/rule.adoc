== Why is this an issue?

The ability to map a class to a database table has made database interaction in Java a lot easier. But map multiple classes to the same table and you'll end up with a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. In the worse case scenario, it could lead to serious data corruption.


This rule raises an issue when multiple classes are mapped to the same table with Hibernate or JPA annotations.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
@Entity  // implicitly mapped to "point" table
public class Point {
  // ..
}

@Entity 
@Table(name = "point")  // Noncompliant
public class Spot { 
  // ...
}
----
