By definition, primitive types are not Objects and so they can't be ``++null++``. Adding ``++@CheckForNull++`` or ``++@Nullable++`` on primitive types adds confusion and is useless.


This rule raises an issue when ``++@CheckForNull++`` or ``++@Nullable++`` is set on a method returning a primitive type: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
@CheckForNull
boolean isFoo() {
 ...
}

== Compliant Solution

----
boolean isFoo() {
 ...
}
