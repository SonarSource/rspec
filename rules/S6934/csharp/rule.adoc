When a route template is defined through an attribute on an action method, conventional routing for that action is disabled. To maintain good practice, it's recommended not to combine conventional and attribute-based routing within a single controller to avoid unpredicted behavior. As such, the controller should exclude itself from conventional routing by applying a `[Route]` attribute.

== Why is this an issue?

In https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview[ASP.NET Core MVC], the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing[routing] middleware utilizes a series of rules and conventions to identify the appropriate controller and action method to handle a specific HTTP request. This process, known as _conventional routing_, is generally established using the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.controllerendpointroutebuilderextensions.mapcontrollerroute[`MapControllerRoute`] method. This method is typically configured in one central location for all controllers during the application setup.

Conversely, _attribute routing_ allows routes to be defined at the controller or action method level. It is possible to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing#mixed-routing-attribute-routing-vs-conventional-routing[mix both mechanisms]. Although it's permissible to employ diverse routing strategies across multiple controllers, combining both mechanisms within one controller can result in confusion and increased complexity, as illustrated below.

[source,csharp]
----
// Conventional mapping definition
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

public class PersonController
{
    // Conventional routing:
    // Matches e.g. /Person/Index/123
    public IActionResult Index(int? id) => View();

    // Attribute routing:
    // Matches e.g. /Age/Ascending (and model binds "Age" to sortBy and "Ascending" to direction)
    // but does not match /Person/List/Age/Ascending
    [HttpGet(template: "{sortBy}/{direction}")]
    public IActionResult List(string sortBy, SortOrder direction) => View();
}
----

== How to fix it in ASP.NET Core

When any of the controller actions are annotated with a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.routing.httpmethodattribute[`HttpMethodAttribute`] with a route template defined, you should specify a route template on the controller with the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.routeattribute[`RouteAttribute`] as well.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class PersonController : Controller
{
    // Matches /Person/Index/123
    public IActionResult Index(int? id) => View();
    
    // Matches /Age/Ascending
    [HttpGet(template: "{sortBy}/{direction}")] // Noncompliant: The "Index" and the "List" actions are
                                                // reachable via different routing mechanisms and routes
    public IActionResult List(string sortBy, SortOrder direction) => View();
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
[Route("[controller]/{action=Index}")]
public class PersonController : Controller
{
    // Matches /Person/Index/123
    [Route("{id?}")]
    public IActionResult Index(int? id) => View();
    
    // Matches Person/List/Age/Ascending
    [HttpGet("{sortBy}/{direction}")] // Compliant: The route is relative to the controller
    public IActionResult List(string sortBy, SortOrder direction) => View();
}
----

There are also alternative options to prevent the mixing of conventional and attribute-based routing:

[source,csharp]
----
// Option 1. Replace the attribute-based routing with a conventional route
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "Lists",
    pattern: "{controller}/List/{sortBy}/{direction}",
    defaults: new { action = "List" } ); // Matches Person/List/Age/Ascending

// Option 2. Use a binding, that does not depend on route templates
public class PersonController : Controller
{
    // Matches Person/List?sortBy=Age&direction=Ascending
    [HttpGet] // Compliant: Parameters are bound from the query string
    public IActionResult List(string sortBy, SortOrder direction) => View();
}

// Option 3. Use an absolute route
public class PersonController : Controller
{
    // Matches Person/List/Age/Ascending
    [HttpGet("/[controller]/[action]/{sortBy}/{direction}")] // Illustrate the expected route by starting with "/"
    public IActionResult List(string sortBy, SortOrder direction) => View();
}
----
