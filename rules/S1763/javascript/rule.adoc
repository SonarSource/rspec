== Why is this an issue?

Unreachable code is the code whose statements cannot be executed under any circumstances. Jump statements, like ``++return++``, ``++break++``, ``++continue++``, and ``++throw++``,  alter the normal flow of control within a program, making it possible to skip certain parts of the code, terminate loops prematurely, or exit from functions. So any statements that come after a jump are effectively unreachable.

Unreachable statements can be a sign of a logical error or oversight in the program's design, leading to unexpected behavior at runtime.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
function func(a) {
  let i = 10;
  return i + a; 
  i++; // Noncompliant: this is never executed
}
----

Identify and remove unreachable statements from your code.
