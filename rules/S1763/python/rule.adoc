== Why is this an issue?

Jump statements (``++return++``, ``++break++``, ``++continue++``, and ``++raise++``) move control flow out of the current code block. So any statements that come after a jump are dead code.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
def fun(a):
  i = 10
  return i + a       # Noncompliant 
  i += 1             # this is never executed
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
def fun(a):
  i = 10
  return i + a

* Primary Location: the block of code that is unreachable
* Secondary Locations: the line of code which explain why the code is unreachable (jump statement, continue, ...)
