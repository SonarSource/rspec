== Why is this an issue?

Jump statements (``++return++``, ``++break++`` and ``++next++``) move control flow out of the current code block. So any statements that come after a jump are dead code. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby]
----
def foo(a)
  i = 10
  return a + i    # Noncompliant 
  i += 1          # dead code
end
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,ruby]
----
def foo(a)
  i = 10
  return a + i
end
----
