Some statements (`return`, `break`, `continue`, `goto`, `co_return`) and `throw` expressions move control flow out of the current code block. Furthermore, some function do not return control flow (e.g. `abort()`, `std::terminate()`, functions with the ``++[[noreturn]]++`` attribute).

Any unlabeled statements that come after such a jump or function call are unreachable, and either this dead code should be removed, or the logic should be corrected.
