== Why is this an issue?

Ternary operator should not be used to select between two boolean values, or instead of a logical `OR` operation. Ternary expressions are often difficult to read, so if a simpler syntax exists, it should be used instead of a ternary expression. This happens when  

 - the expression returns two boolean values

[source,javascript]
----
let isGood = value > 0 ? true : false; // Non-compliant, replace with value > 0
let isBad = value > 0 ? false : true; // Non-compliant, replace with !(value > 0)
----

 - the same value is used for both the conditional test and the consequent

[source,javascript]
----
let a = x ? x : y;  // Non-compliant, replace with x || y
----
