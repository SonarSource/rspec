== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

=== What is the potential impact?

Google API keys are used to authenticate applications that consume Google Cloud APIs.

API keys are not strictly secret as they are often embedded into client-side
code or mobile applications that consume Google Cloud APIs. Still, they should
be secured.

==== Financial loss

An unrestricted Google API key being disclosed in a public source code could be
used by malicious actors to consume Google APIs on behalf of your
application. +
This will have a financial impact as your organization will be
billed for the data consumed by the malicious actor.

==== Denial of service

If your account has enabled quota to cap the API consumption of your
application, this quota can be exceeded, leaving your application unable to
request the Google APIs it requires to function properly.

== How to fix it

Depending on the sensitivity of the key use, only administrators should have
access to the Google API keys used by your application.

**For client-facing keys**

If the key must be sent to clients for the service to run properly, then it does
not need to be revoked or added to a Vault, ignore the following sections. +
However, it is important to apply
https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#securing[Google's guidelines to secure the API keys].

These best practices will help mitigate abuse of this key.
