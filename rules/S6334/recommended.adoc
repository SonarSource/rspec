== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Only administrators should have access to the Google API keys used by your application.

As a consequence, Google API keys should not be stored along with the application code as they could be disclosed to a large audience or could be made public.

Google API keys should be stored outside of the code in a file that is never committed to your application code repository.

If possible, a better alternative is to use your cloud provider's service for managing secrets. On Google Cloud this service is called https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager[Secret Manager].

When credentials are disclosed in the application code, consider them as compromised and revoke them immediately.

In addition to secure storage, it's important to apply https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#api_key_restrictions[restrictions] to API keys in order to mitigate the impacts when they are discovered by malicious actors.
