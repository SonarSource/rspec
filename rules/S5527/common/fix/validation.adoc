To fix the vulnerability of disabled hostname validation, it is strongly
recommended to first re-enable the default validation and fix the root cause: the validity of the certificate.

==== Use valid certificates

If a hostname validation failure prevents connecting to the target server, keep
in mind that **one system's code should not work around another system's problems**,
as this creates unnecessary dependencies and can lead to reliability issues.

Therefore, the first solution is to change the remote host's certificate to
match its identity. If the remote host is not under your control, consider replicating its
service to a server whose certificate you can change yourself.

In case the contacted host is located on a development machine, and if there
is no other choice, try following this solution:

* Create a self-signed certificate for that machine.
* Add this self-signed certificate to the system's trust store.
* If the hostname is not `localhost`, add the hostname in the `/etc/hosts` file.
