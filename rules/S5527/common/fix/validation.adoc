To fix the vulnerability of disabled hostname validation, it is strongly
recommended to first re-enable the default validation and fix the root cause: the validity of the certificate.

==== Use valid certificates

If a hostname validation failure prevents connecting to the target server, keep
in mind that **one system's code should not work around another system's problems**,
as this creates unnecessary dependencies and can lead to reliability issues. +
Therefore, the first solution is to change the remote host's certificate to
match its identity. If the remote host is not under your control, consider replicating its
service to a server whose certificate you can change yourself.


In case the contacted host is located on a development machine, and if there
is no other choice, try following this solution:

* Create a self-signed certificate for that machine.
* Add this self-signed certificate to the system's trust store.
* If the hostname is not `localhost`, add the hostname in the `/etc/hosts` file.
