=== What is the potential impact?

Establishing trust in a secure way is a non-trivial task. When you disable
hostname validation, you are removing a key mechanism designed to build this
trust in internet communication, opening your system up to a number of
potential threats.

==== Identity spoofing

If a system does not validate hostnames, it cannot confirm the identity of
the other party involved in the communication. An attacker can exploit this by
creating a fake server and masquerading it as a legitimate one. For example,
they might set up a server that looks like your bank's server, tricking your
system into thinking it is communicating with the bank. This scenario, called
identity spoofing, allows the attacker to collect any data your system sends
to them, potentially leading to significant data breaches.
