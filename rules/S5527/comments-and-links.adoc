{empty}.NET API offers https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.remotecertificatevalidationcallback[a single callback] to override TLS certificates chain and hostname validation. RSPEC-4830 already detects that this callback always accept the server certificate without validation. There is no easy way to detects code that validates the certificate chain and fails to validate the server hostname in this callback.

Therefore, this will not be implemented for .NET langauges.
