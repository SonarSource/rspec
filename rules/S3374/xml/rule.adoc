== Why is this an issue?

According to the Common Weakness Enumeration,

____
If two validation forms have the same name, the Struts Validator arbitrarily chooses one of the forms to use for input validation and discards the other. This decision might not correspond to the programmer's expectations...
____


In such a case, it is likely that the two forms should be combined. At the very least, one should be removed.

  </formset>
</form-validation>
