This rule partially overlaps with https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-4604[RSPEC-4604] with regards to ``++SpringBootApplication++``. RSPEC-4604 suggests having either ``++@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {})++`` , or using ``++@Import++`` - like this rule

Even if it overlaps with RSPEC-4604, [~andrei.epure] and I decided to add it to SonarJava because this rule is not in the "Sonar way" profile. So it will be not be noisy, but useful to those who requires it.

 Unfortunately, I think this rule is misleading. The impact of component scanning is very low, even with somewhat large application. We've implemented a compile-time indexer that really makes a difference with thousands of beans from tens of thousands of candidates.


A better way to structure this rule would be to guide users to rationalize the candidates in a given package. So, for instance, avoiding the use of `@ComponentScan("org")` or even`@ComponentScan("org.mycompany")`. Component scan is better use on the project's asserts (i.e. `org.mycomponent.myproject`). For libraries or reusable components, `@Import` is a better choice indeed.
