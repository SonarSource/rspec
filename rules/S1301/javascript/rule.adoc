== Why is this an issue?

A ``++switch++`` statement is a control flow statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. It provides a more concise way to handle multiple conditions compared to using multiple ``++if-else++`` statements.

If you only have a single condition to check, using an ``++if++``` statement is simpler and more concise. ``++switch++`` statements are designed for handling multiple cases, so using them for a single condition can be overkill and less readable.

This rule raises an issue when a ``++switch++`` statement has only one ``++case++`` clause and possibly a ``++default`` one.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
switch (condition) { // Noncompliant: The switch has only one case and a default
  case 0:
    doSomething();
    break;
  default:
    doSomethingElse();
    break;
}
----

Use a ``++switch++`` statement when you have multiple cases to handle and an ``++if++`` statement when you have only one condition to check.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (condition === 0) {
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomethingElse();
}
