\[~freddy.mallet], [~ann.campbell.2], [~massimo.paladin], guys, I can't find RSPEC for MISRA C:2012 16.6 (Every switch statement shall have at least two switch-clauses). And looks like this spec is more strong and so supersedes it. So maybe we should add a reference here, which will increase coverage of MISRA C:2012 for free?


In addition this spec is more strong than RSPEC-921. Hence maybe we should close the last one and add references here?
