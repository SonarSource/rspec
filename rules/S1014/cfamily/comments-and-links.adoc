\[~ann.campbell.2] I sightly updated the message. Taking our example I think we want to flag the issue on the declarations in B2 with a reference on the declarations in B1 that are hidden.

So that would give :

"count" defined in "B2" clashes with definition in "B1" in file "file" on line 4

Ideally we probably want to drop the reference to the file/line and replace it with the ability to jump to that position from the issue.

\[~samuel.mercier] Given example violates rules of "Member name lookup" (CPP03-CPP11 10.2), exactly because it is ambiguous. So I'm wondering - is there a compiler, which will accept such code? or can this code be changed in a way that will be accepted by compiler, but still violate this rule?

We can take the given code without implementation of method Bar in D. In that case the code compiles and we can report issues on fields count and method foo, since they are ambiguous in the hierarchy, but IMO this has very little value.


I would vote to close it.
