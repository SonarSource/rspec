<p>If the names are ambiguous, the compiler should report the name clash and not generate arbitrary or unexpectedly resolved code. However, this ambiguity may not be obvious to a developer.</p>

<p>There is also a specific concern that if the member function is virtual, resolving the ambiguity by explicitly referencing the base class in effect removes the virtual behaviour from the function.</p>

<p>\[~ann.campbell.2] I sightly updated the message. Taking our example I think we want to flag the issue on the declarations in B2 with a reference on the declarations in B1 that are hidden.</p>

<p>\[~samuel.mercier] Given example violates rules of "Member name lookup" (CPP03-CPP11 10.2), exactly because it is ambiguous. So I&#8217;m wondering - is there a compiler, which will accept such code? or can this code be changed in a way that will be accepted by compiler, but still violate this rule?</p>

<p>We can take the given code without implementation of method Bar in D. In that case the code compiles and we can report issues on fields count and method foo, since they are ambiguous in the hierarchy, but IMO this has very little value.</p>
