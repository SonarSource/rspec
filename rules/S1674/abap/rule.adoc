== Why is this an issue?

Leaving a ``++CATCH++`` block empty means that the exception in question is neither handled nor passed forward to callers for handling at a higher level. Suppressing errors rather than handling them could lead to unpredictable system behavior and should be avoided.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
  try.
    if ABS( NUMBER ) > 100.
      write / 'Number is large'.
    endif.
    catch CX_SY_ARITHMETIC_ERROR into OREF.
  endtry.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,abap]
----
  try.
    if ABS( NUMBER ) > 100.
      write / 'Number is large'.
    endif.
  catch CX_SY_ARITHMETIC_ERROR into OREF.
    write / OREF->GET_TEXT( ).
  endtry.
----


=== Exceptions

When a block contains a comment, it is not considered to be empty.
