== Why is this an issue?

Leaving a ``++CATCH++`` block empty means that the exception in question is neither handled nor passed forward to callers for handling at a higher level. Suppressing errors rather than handling them could lead to unpredictable system behavior and should be avoided.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
  try.
    if ABS( NUMBER ) > 100.
      write / 'Number is large'.
    endif.
    catch CX_SY_ARITHMETIC_ERROR into OREF.
  endtry.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,abap]
----
  try.
    if ABS( NUMBER ) > 100.
      write / 'Number is large'.
    endif.
  catch CX_SY_ARITHMETIC_ERROR into OREF.
    write / OREF->GET_TEXT( ).
  endtry.

=== Exceptions

When a block contains a comment, it is not considered to be empty.

\[~nicolas.peru] note that this rule that was originally written for ABAP has been extended for Java & an exception added for a comment in the block, making ABAP outdated.

I think it should be classified as a "Vulnerability Detection". This RSPEC was classified like this in the past (2015) thanks to the tag "security". I don't see any good reason why we changed that. Also, we have an OWASP TOP 10 tag on the RSPEC replacing this one (RSPEC-2486) which is another justification to classify it as a "Vulnerability Detection".


Do you agree?
