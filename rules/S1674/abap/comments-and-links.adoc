I think it should be classified as a "Vulnerability Detection". This RSPEC was classified like this in the past (2015) thanks to the tag "security". I don't see any good reason why we changed that. Also, we have an OWASP TOP 10 tag on the RSPEC replacing this one (RSPEC-2486) which is another justification to classify it as a "Vulnerability Detection".


Do you agree?
