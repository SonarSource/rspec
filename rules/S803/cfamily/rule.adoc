== Why is this an issue?

No tag name shall be reused either to define a different tag or for any other purpose within the program. ISO 9899:1990 [2] does not define the behaviour when an aggregate declaration uses a tag in different forms of type specifier (struct or union). Either all uses of the tag should be in structure type specifiers, or all uses should be in union type specifiers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct stag { uint16_t a; uint16_t b; };
struct stag a1 = { 0, 0 }; // Compliant, compatible with above
union stag a2 = { 0, 0 }; // Noncompliant, definition was a 'struct'
void foo(void)
{
  struct stag { uint16_t a; }; // Noncompliant, tag stag redefined
}

Use ["struct"|"union"] (instead of ["union"|"struct"]) to match the definition.
