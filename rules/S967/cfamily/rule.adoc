== Why is this an issue?

Because the evaluation order of ``++#++`` and ``++##++`` are not specified, the results of using them both in the same macro could be unpredictable. Therefore macros should contain at most once instance of either ``++#++`` or ``++##++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#define NonCompliant(a, b)  # a ## b 
int main() {  
  std::cout << NonCompliant(Hello, World);
}
----
The result of this code is unspecified. It will either print "HelloWorld" or trigger a compilation error. If ## is evaluated first this will print HelloWorld. If # is evaluated first this will cause a compilation error telling that *"Hello"World* is not a valid preprocessor token.


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#define Stringfy(a) #a
#define Compliant(a, b)  Stringfy(a##b) 

int main(){  
  std::cout << Compliant(Hello, World);
}
----
This example will always print "HelloWorld".
