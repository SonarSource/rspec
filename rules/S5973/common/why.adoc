Unstable / flaky tests are tests which sometimes pass and sometimes fail, without any code change. Obviously, they slow down developments when developers have to rerun failed tests. However, the real problem is that you can't completely trust these tests, they might fail for many different reasons and you don't know if any of them will happen in production.
