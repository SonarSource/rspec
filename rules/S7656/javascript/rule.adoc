This rule raises an issue when a class decorated with `@Pipe` does not implement the `PipeTransform` interface.

== Why is this an issue?

Angular Pipes are classes that transform data for display in templates. The `PipeTransform` interface defines the contract that all pipes must follow, specifically requiring a `transform` method with the correct signature.

When a pipe class doesn't implement `PipeTransform`, several problems can occur:

* **Type Safety**: Without the interface, TypeScript cannot verify that the `transform` method has the correct signature, leading to potential runtime errors.
* **IDE Support**: Code editors and IDEs rely on the interface to provide accurate autocompletion, refactoring support, and error detection.
* **Code Clarity**: The interface makes it explicit that the class is intended to be used as a pipe, improving code readability and maintainability.
* **Angular Conventions**: Following Angular's recommended patterns ensures consistency across the codebase and makes it easier for other developers to understand the code.

The `PipeTransform` interface requires implementing a `transform` method that takes a value and optional parameters, returning the transformed result. This contract ensures that pipes work correctly within Angular's change detection and template rendering system.

=== What is the potential impact?

Without implementing `PipeTransform`, pipes may have incorrect method signatures that cause runtime errors, lack proper type checking, and provide poor developer experience with reduced IDE support and code clarity.

=== How to fix?


Add `implements PipeTransform` to the pipe class declaration. Import the `PipeTransform` interface from `@angular/core` if not already imported.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Pipe({ name: 'example' })
class ExamplePipe { // Noncompliant
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({ name: 'example' })
class ExamplePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
----
