This rule raises an issue when a class decorated with `@Pipe` does not implement the `PipeTransform` interface.

== Why is this an issue?

Angular Pipes are expected to implement the `PipeTransform` interface to ensure type safety and follow Angular conventions.

The `PipeTransform` interface defines the contract that all pipes must follow, requiring a `transform` method with proper typing. Without this interface:

* TypeScript cannot verify that your pipe implements the required `transform` method correctly
* The pipe may not work as expected if the method signature is wrong
* Code becomes less maintainable and harder to understand
* You miss out on IDE support like autocompletion and error detection

Implementing `PipeTransform` makes your code more robust and follows Angular's recommended patterns.

=== What is the potential impact?

Without implementing `PipeTransform`, pipes may have incorrect method signatures leading to runtime errors. The code also becomes less maintainable and loses TypeScript's type checking benefits.

=== How to fix?


Add `implements PipeTransform` to your pipe class and import the interface from `@angular/core`.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Pipe({ name: 'test' })
class Test { // Noncompliant
  transform(value: string) {}
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import { PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({ name: 'test' })
class Test implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string) {}
}
----
