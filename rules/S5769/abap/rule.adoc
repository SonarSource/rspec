== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++LOOP...INTO++``  with ``++MODIFY++`` statements will put the required record in a work area, process it and put it back in the internal table. It is more efficient to modify the internal table directly by using ``++LOOP...ASSIGNING++`` and field-symbols.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++LOOP...INTO++`` contains one or more ``++MODIFY++`` statements.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
LOOP AT i_bseg INTO wa_bseg.
    ...
    wa_bseg-sgtxt = 'VALUE'.
    MODIFY i_bseg FROM wa_bseg.
ENDLOOP.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,abap]
----
LOOP AT i_bseg ASSIGNING <fs_bseg>.
  ...
  <fs_bseg>-sgtxt = 'VALUE'.
ENDLOOP.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

Replace this "LOOP INTO" and "MODIFY" with "LOOP ASSIGNING" and field-symbols.


=== Highlighting

Primary: the whole LOOP...INTO statement, but not the body of the loop.

Secondary:

* Every "MODIFY" statement
* message: replace this "MODIFY" with a field-symbol
