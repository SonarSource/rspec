This rule raises an issue when an interface partial method lacks an explicit `virtual` modifier, making its non-virtual behavior implicit and potentially unexpected.

== Why is this an issue?

In C# 14/.NET 10, interface partial methods introduced a breaking change in behavior consistency. Unlike regular interface methods and other partial interface members (properties, events), partial methods in interfaces are implicitly non-virtual.

This inconsistency can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior:

* Regular interface methods are implicitly virtual
* Interface partial properties and events are implicitly virtual  
* Interface partial methods are implicitly non-virtual

When developers work with interfaces, they typically expect all members to follow virtual dispatch semantics. The implicit non-virtual behavior of partial methods breaks this expectation and can cause runtime behavior that differs from what the code appears to do.

This inconsistency makes interface design less predictable and can lead to subtle bugs, especially when refactoring code or when multiple developers work on the same codebase with different levels of awareness about this language quirk.

=== What is the potential impact?

The implicit non-virtual behavior can cause unexpected runtime behavior where method calls don't follow the expected virtual dispatch pattern. This can lead to incorrect program logic, especially in inheritance scenarios or when using dependency injection frameworks that rely on virtual method behavior.

== How to fix it

Add the `virtual` modifier to interface partial methods when virtual behavior is intended, making the intent explicit and consistent with other interface members.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
interface IDataProcessor
{
    partial void ProcessData(string input); // Noncompliant: implicitly non-virtual
    partial void ValidateInput(object data); // Noncompliant: implicitly non-virtual
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
interface IDataProcessor
{
    virtual partial void ProcessData(string input); // Explicitly virtual
    virtual partial void ValidateInput(object data); // Explicitly virtual
}
----
