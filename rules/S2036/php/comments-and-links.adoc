\[~ann.campbell.2] Explanation is great IMO. I just have 3 comments:


* I would use the word *evaluated* instead of *executed* in the sentence _"should not contain ``++print++`` statements that will be *executed* automatically on inclusion"_
* "side-effects" is present in the title but not in the description, I think it would be worth to mention it just be clear on its meaning.
* I would add a bullet point with "..." jus to be clear that the list is not exhaustive, even if you used the word "include".
Thanks!
