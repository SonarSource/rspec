== Why is this an issue?

Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. For that reason, file names should conform to a defined standard.
In Dart the convention is to name files using lowercase with underscore.This rule raises an issue when the names of analyzed files donâ€™t match this convention.

This convention also helps to operate with different file systems, which may be case-insensitive.

These file names will violate convention:

* MyFile.dart
* myFile.dart
* my-file.dart
* My_File.dart

And the proper name in this case will be:

* my_file.dart
