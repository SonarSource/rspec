=== How to fix it in .NET

The following code is vulnerable to command injections because it is using untrusted inputs to set up a new process.
Therefore an attacker can execute an arbitrary program that is installed on the system.

=== How does this work?

The mitigation strategy can be based on a list of authorized and safe commands to execute. Keep in mind that when a single argument to the command is user-controlled, it can still lead to vulnerabilities if the attacker can inject a dangerous option supported by the command, such as ``++-exec++`` available with ``++find++``.
