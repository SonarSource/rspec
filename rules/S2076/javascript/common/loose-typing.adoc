**Important note**: Because JavaScript is a loosely typed language, extra care
should be taken when accepting user-controlled parameters. Here, the `concat`
method, used to add an argument to the command to run, accepts both single
objects and object arrays as input. Ensuring that the untrusted parameter is a
`string` is mandatory to prevent multiple command line arguments from being
added.
