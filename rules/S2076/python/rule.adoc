Applications that execute operating system commands or execute commands that interact with the underlying system should neutralize any externally-provided values used in those commands. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to include input that executes unintended commands or exposes sensitive data.


The problem could be mitigated in any of the following ways:

* Using https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html[subprocess module] without the ``++shell=true++``. In this case ``++subprocess++`` expects an array where command and arguments are clearly separated.
* Escaping shell argument with https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote[shlex.quote]

== Noncompliant Code Example

``++os++``

----
from flask import request
import os

@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    address = request.args.get("address")
    cmd = "ping -c 1 %s" % address
    os.popen(cmd) # Noncompliant
----

``++subprocess++``

----
from flask import request
import subprocess

@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    address = request.args.get("address")
    cmd = "ping -c 1 %s" % address
    subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True) # Noncompliant; using shell=true is unsafe
----

== Compliant Solution

``++os++``

----
from flask import request
import os

@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    address = shlex.quote(request.args.get("address")) # address argument is shell-escaped
    cmd = "ping -c 1 %s" % address
    os.popen(cmd ) # Compliant
----

``++subprocess++``

----
from flask import request
import subprocess

@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    address = request.args.get("address")
    args = ["ping", "-c1", address]
    subprocess.Popen(args) # Compliant
