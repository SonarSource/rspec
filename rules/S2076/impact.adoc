=== What is the potential impact?
In the context of a web application vulnerable to OS injection: +
After detecting the injection, attackers inject data into the vulnerable field
to execute malicious commands in the affected operating system(s).

The impact depends on the access control measures taken on the target system
OS.

The following real-world scenarios illustrate the various impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Denial of Service and Data Leaks
In this scenario, the attack aims to disrupt the organization's activities and
profit from data leaks. The attackers sift through the internal server's data
to exfiltrate the most valuable assets, corrupt data and stop services.

In extreme cases, the attackers can either:

* Remain on the server and download files over an extended period of time.
* Send ransomware to the server to completely cripple it.

This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).

==== Chain OS injections with other vulnerabilities.

Depending on the underlying servers of the web application, the impact depends
on how focused the target company is on its Defense In Depth.

Disruptions include critical privilege escalation, enterprise-wide denials of
service, or enterprise-wide data leaks. +

OS injections are truly gaping windows into the inner workings of an
organization's information system.

For example, the entire infrastructure can be disrupted by a combination of OS
injections and *misconfiguration* of:

* Docker, Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters.
* cloud services
* Network firewalls and routing
* OS access control
