==== Neutralize special characters

If the application is to execute complex commands that cannot be controlled
thanks to pre-approved lists, the cleanest approach is to use special
sanitization libraries, such as `{sanitizationLib}`.

The library helps you to get rid of common dangerous characters, such as:

* `&`
* `|`
* `;`
* `$`
* `>`
* `<`
* `\``
* `\\`
* `!`

If user input is to be included in the arguments of a command, the application
must ensure that dangerous options or argument delimiters are neutralized. +
Argument delimiters count `'`, `-` and spaces.

For example, the `find` command from UNIX supports the dangerous argument
`-exec`. +
In this case, option processing can be terminated with a string containing `--`
or with special options. For example, `git` supports
`--end-of-options` https://github.blog/2019-11-03-highlights-from-git-2-24/#tidbits[since its version 2.24].
