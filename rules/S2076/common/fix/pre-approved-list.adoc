==== Pre-Approved commands

If the application aims to execute only a small number of OS commands (for
example, `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd`), the cleanest way to avoid this problem is to
validate the input before using it in an OS command.

Create a list of authorized and secure commands that you want the application
to be able to execute. If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it
should be rejected because it is considered unsafe.

Depending on the number of commands you want the application to support, the
list can be either a regex string or any array type. If you use regexes, choose
simple regexes to avoid ReDOS attacks. For example, you can accept only Latin
characters by using `^[a-zA-Z]{1-10}$`.

*Important note*: The application must do validation on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
