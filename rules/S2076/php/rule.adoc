== Noncompliant Code Example

An arbitrary command can be executed:

----
$cmd = $_GET["cmd"];

// If the command "/sbin/shutdown" is executed and the web server is running as root,
// then the machine running the web server will be shut down and become unavailable for future requests

exec($cmd); // Noncompliant
----

Shell meta-characters can be used to execute additional commands in PHP functions that execute commands:

----
$arg = $_GET["arg"];

// the attacker can perform: "argvalue | /sbin/shutdown"

exec("/usr/bin/cat ".$arg); // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

Restrict the command to be executed with an allowlist:

----
$cmd = $_GET["cmd"];

if ($cmd === "/usr/bin/stat" || $cmd === "/usr/bin/cat") {
   exec($cmd." /tmp/test.txt", $output);
}
----

Use `escapeshellarg` to escape shell meta-characters from a specific argument:

----

$arg = $_GET["arg"];

exec("/usr/bin/cat ".escapeshellarg($arg)); 
----
