Within the command, arguments and filenames as options are passed as strings.
Programs may misinterpret files as arguments if the file name starts with a single or double dash.
When filenames are specified using glob, files whose names begin with a dash are not included in the scope.
For example, if a file is named "-f" and passed as an argument to a command such as "rm", it may be interpreted as a command line option instead of a file, causing unexpected behaviour.
This issue affects all instructions processing shell commands.
