To avoid this issue, using "./" before the file name will cause it to be interpreted as a file and not an option.
Additionally, adding "--" at the end of command line arguments indicates the end of options and any subsequent arguments will be treated as file names.
However, this fix should only be used if the command supports it as expected.
