Modern browsers ignore unneeded, trailing commas, so there are no negatives to having them unless you're supporting an IE 8 application. Since they make adding new properties simpler, their use is preferred. This rule raises an issue when the last item in a multiline construct (arrays, objects, imports, exports, and functions) does not end with a trailing comma and does not lie on the same line as the closing curly brace or bracket.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
var joe = { 
  fname: "Joe",  
  lname: "Smith"      // Noncompliant
};
----


== Compliant Solution

----
var joe = {  
  fname: "Joe",
  lname: "Smith",    // OK
};

var joe = {  
  fname: "Joe",
  lname: "Smith"};   // OK
----
