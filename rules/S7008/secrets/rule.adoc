=== What is the potential impact?

Azure Logic Apps are used to automate workflows and integrate applications and
services. They can be triggered by events in Azure services, third-party
services, or on-premises systems. Logic Apps can be used to automate business
processes, orchestrate workflows, and integrate systems and services.

Shared Access Signatures (SAS) are used to provide access to endpoints on logic
apps where the trigger is a reception of an HTTP request.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
