=== What is the potential impact?

Azure Logic Apps are used to automate workflows and integrate applications and
services. They can be triggered by events in Azure services, third-party
services, or on-premises systems. Logic Apps can be used to automate business
processes, orchestrate workflows, and integrate systems and services.

Shared Access Signatures (SAS) are used to provide delegated access to resources
in Azure. They are used to grant access to resources for a specific period of
time and with specific permissions. SAS tokens are used to authenticate
requests to Azure Storage services, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, and
other Azure services.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
