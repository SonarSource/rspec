== Why is this an issue?

Allocation functions are always ``++static++``. Explicitly declaring such a function ``++static++`` needlessly clutters the code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct S {
  static void* operator new(std::size_t); // Noncompliant; static is redundant
  static void  operator delete(void*);    // Noncompliant; static is redundant
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct S {
  void* operator new(std::size_t);
  void  operator delete(void*);
};
----

Any allocation function for a class T is a static member (even if not explicitly declared static).
