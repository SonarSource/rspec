Allocation functions are always ``++static++``. Explicitly declaring such a function ``++static++`` needlessly clutters the code.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
struct S {
  static void* operator new(std::size_t); // Noncompliant; static is redundant
  static void  operator delete(void*);    // Noncompliant; static is redundant
};
----


== Compliant Solution

----
struct S {
  void* operator new(std::size_t);
  void  operator delete(void*);
};
----
