== Why is this an issue?

`HttpSession` is managed by web servers and can be serialized and stored on disk as the server manages its memory use in a process called "passivation".

Even though `HttpSession` does not extend `Serializable`, you must nonetheless assume that it will be serialized.
If non-serializable objects were stored in the session, its serialization might fail.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class Address {
  //...
}

HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("address", new Address());  // Noncompliant; Address isn't serializable
----

=== Compliant solution
[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class Address implements Serializable {
  //...
}

HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("address", new Address());
----
