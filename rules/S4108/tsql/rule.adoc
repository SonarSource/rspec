== Why is this an issue?

``++@@IDENTITY++`` returns the last identity column value created on a connection, regardless of the scope. That means it could return the last identity value you produced, or it could return a value generated by a user defined function or trigger, possibly one fired because of your insert. In order to access the last identity value created in your scope, use ``++SCOPE_IDENTITY()++`` instead.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
INSERT ...

SET @id = @@IDENTITY  -- Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
INSERT ...

SET @id = SCOPE_IDENTITY()
----
