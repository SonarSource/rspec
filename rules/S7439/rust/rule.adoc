== Why is this an issue?

Comparisons involving overlapping ranges that can never be true are likely a programming mistake and can result in unreachable code.


=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,rust,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if status_code <= 400 && status_code > 500 {  // Noncompliant: The condition can never be true.
  // ...
}
