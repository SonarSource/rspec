Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service to host OpenSearch instances. It
replaces Elasticsearch Service, which has been deprecated.

To harden domain (cluster) data in case of unauthorized access, OpenSearch
provides data-at-rest encryption if the engine is OpenSearch (any version), or
Elasticsearch with a version of 5.1 or above. Enabling encryption at rest will
help protect:

* indices
* logs
* swap files
* data in the application directory
* automated snapshots

Thus, adversaries cannot access the data if they gain physical access to the storage medium.
