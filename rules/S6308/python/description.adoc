Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service to host OpenSearch instances. It replaces Elasticsearch Service, which has been deprecated.
To harden domain (cluster) data in case of unauthorized access, OpenSearch provides data-at-rest encryption if the engine is OpenSearch or Elasticsearch with a version of 5.1 or above. Enabling encryption at rest will help protect:

* Indices
* Logs
* Swap files
* Data in the application directory
* Automated snapshots

Thus, adversaries cannot access the data if they gain physical access to the storage medium.
