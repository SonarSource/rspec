Amazon Elasticsearch Service (ES) is a managed service to host Elasticsearch instances. ES domains can be encrypted if the Elasticsearch version is 5.1 or above, ensuring the security of data-at-rest. If the encryption is enabled indices, logs, swap files, data in the application directory, and automated snapshots are stored encrypted.
