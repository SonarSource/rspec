Amazon Elasticsearch Service (ES) is a managed service to host Elasticsearch instances. ES domains can be encrypted if the Elasticsearch version is 5.1 or above, ensuring the security of data-at-rest. If the encryption is enabled indices, logs, swap files, data in the application directory, and automated snapshots are stored encrypted. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium they are not able to access the data.
