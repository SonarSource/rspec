== Why is this an issue?

Any extensible class might have subclasses located in a different package. When that happens, the use of ``++this.getClass().getResource++`` with a relative path would mean that the resource isn't found for the child class.


Instead, use an absolute path or make the class ``++final++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {

private URL url = null;

  public MyClass(){
    this.url = this.getClass().getResource("file.txt");  // Noncompliant
  }
