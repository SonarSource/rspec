According to its JavaDocs, the intermediate Stream operation ``++java.util.Stream.peek()++`` “exists mainly to support debugging” purposes.

A key difference with other intermediate Stream operations is that the Stream implementation is free to skip calls to ``++peek()++`` for optimization purpose. This can lead to ``++peek()++`` being unexpectedly called only for some or none of the elements in the Stream.


As a consequence, relying on ``++peek()++`` without careful consideration can lead to error-prone code.


This rule raises an issue for each use of peek() to be sure that it is challenged and validated by the team to be meant for production debugging/logging purposes.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Stream.of("one", "two", "three", "four")
         .filter(e -> e.length() > 3)
         .peek(e -> System.out.println("Filtered value: " + e)); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
Stream.of("one", "two", "three", "four")
         .filter(e -> e.length() > 3)
         .foreach(e -> System.out.println("Filtered value: " + e));
