== Why is this an issue?

The `GoSub` statement in VB6 is an unstructured control flow statement. It can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code, as well as potential stack overflow errors due to improper return handling.

Modern programming practices recommend using proper subroutine or function calls instead, which provide better readability, maintainability, and error handling.

== How to fix it

Replace `GoSub` statements with proper subroutine or function calls.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vb6,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Sub ExampleProcedure()
    GoSub SubRoutine
    Exit Sub

SubRoutine:
    ' ...
    Return
End Sub
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vb6,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Sub ExampleProcedure()
    Call SubRoutine
End Sub

Sub SubRoutine()
    ' ...
End Sub
----
