Naming a thread won't make it run faster or more reliably, but it will make it easier to deal with if you need to debug the application.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
  // ...
};
t1.start();   // Noncompliant; this thread wasn't named
----


== Compliant Solution

----
Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
  // ...
};
t1.setName("t1");
t1.start();
----
