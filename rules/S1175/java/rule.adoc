``++Object.finalize()++`` is called by the Garbage Collector at some point after the object becomes unreferenced.


In general, overloading ``++Object.finalize()++`` is a bad idea because:

* The overload may not be called by the Garbage Collector.
* Users are not expected to call ``++Object.finalize()++`` and will get confused.

But beyond that it's a terrible idea to name a method "finalize" if it doesn't actually override ``++Object.finalize()++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public int finalize(int someParameter) {        // Noncompliant
  /* ... */
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public int someBetterName(int someParameter) {  // Compliant
  /* ... */
}
