<p><strong>==This rule is postponed for now==</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rule is controversial as rule <a data-rspec-id="S106" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-106</a> already exists. Detecting the use of standard output and error streams should be visible in the quality gate in most cases. Thus it makes sense to keep <a data-rspec-id="S106" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-106</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rule (<a data-rspec-id="S4805" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-4805</a>) would confuse our users as it would highlight the same thing. It should be implemented but later, once the Hotspot concept is well understood by our community.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the difference between the two RSPECS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-rspec-id="S4805" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-4805</a> will highlight every use of stdout/stderr, as it needs to be audited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-rspec-id="S106" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-106</a> focuses on the best practice of logging instead of using the streams, and will try to avoid the Command Line Interface cases.</p>

<p><strong>========================</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing to Standard Output and Standard Error streams is security sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three kind of vulnerabilities exist in this case:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any sensitive information written to the standard output and standard error streams might be exposed to an attacker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those streams will be probably fed to another application. There is a good chance that it will be displayed in a terminal. An attacker can inject dangerous output that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information needed to monitor and analyse an attack might not be logged, thus increasing the chances of an attack being successful.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t print user input if you can avoid it. If it is required, sanitize all data before printing it on the standard output or standard error stream. You can&#8217;t know what application will receive the output so there will always be a risk, but you should at the very least remove all non-printable characters so that the terminal cannot be attacked. It is also necessary to make sure that the encoding is the one asked by the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Document your output so that users will be warned that some dangerous user input will be printed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Always use loggers instead of standard output and standard error streams if your application is not a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. This will make it easier to monitor and analyse security attacks.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t print sensitive information on those streams.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t give access to those streams to untrusted code. Check that sub-processes don&#8217;t have access to them if you run unsafe processes. [TODO: give concrete examples of stdin/stdout inheritance]</p>
