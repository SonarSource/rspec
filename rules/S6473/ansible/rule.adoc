Exposing administration services can lead to unauthorized access to containers
or escalation of privilege inside of containers.

Administration services like SSH might contain vulnerabilities, hard-coded
credentials, or other security issues that increase the attack surface of a
container deployment. +
Even if the ports of the services do not get forwarded to the host system, by
default they are reachable from other containers in the same network. A
malicious actor that gets access to one container could use such services to
escalate access and privileges.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The container starts an administration service.

There is a risk if you answered yes to the question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Do not start SSH, VNC, RDP or similar administration services in containers.
