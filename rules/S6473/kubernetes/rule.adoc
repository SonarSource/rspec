Exposing administrative services can lead to unauthorized access to pods or escalation of privileges inside pods.

A port that is commonly used for administration services is open or marked as being open. Administration services like SSH might contain vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, or other security issues that increase the attack surface of a Kubernetes deployment.
Even if the ports of the services do not get forwarded to the host system, by default they are reachable from other containers in the same network. A malicious actor that gets access to one container could use such services to escalate access and privileges.

If the administrative port is forwarded through a load balancer, then in most cases this port should be removed from the configuration to make sure it is not reachable externally.
Setting the `containerPort` on a pod is purely informative. Therefore, removing the property is not sufficient to be secure. The port is still open and the service is still accessible.

In both cases, it is most secure to not start any administrative services in deployments. Instead, try to access the required information using Kubernetes's own administrative tools. For example, to execute code inside a container, ``kubectl exec`` can be used. If the administration service is included to access logs, Kubernetes suggests using a sidecar container with a logging agent.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The pod starts an administrative service.

There is a risk if you answered yes to the question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Do not start SSH, VNC, RDP or similar administrative services in pods.
