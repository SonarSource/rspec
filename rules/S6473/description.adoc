A port that is commonly used for administration services is marked as being open
through the `EXPOSE` command. Administration services like SSH might contain
vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, or other security issues that increase
the attack surface of a Docker deployment. +
Even if the ports of the services do not get forwarded to the host system, by
default they are reachable from other containers in the same network. A
malicious actor that gets access to one container could use such services to
escalate access and privileges.

Removing the `EXPOSE` command is not sufficient to be secure. The port is still
open and the service accessible. To be secure no administration services should
not be started.
