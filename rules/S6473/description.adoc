A port that is commonly used for adminstration services like SSH, VNC, or RDP
is marked as being open. Such services might contain vulnerabilities, hard-coded
credentials, or other security issues. +
Even if the ports do not get forwarded to the host system, by default they are
reachable from other containers in the same network. So a malicious actor that
gets access to one container could use such background services to escalate
access and privileges.

Removing the `EXPOSE` command is not sufficient to be secure, it is still
possible to access the port. To be secure the administration services should not
be started.
