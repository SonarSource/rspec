Because the ``++is++`` operator performs a cast if the object is not null, using ``++is++`` to check type and then casting the same argument to that type, necessarily performs two casts. The same result can be achieved more efficiently with a single cast using ``++as++``, followed by a null-check.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (x is Fruit)  // Noncompliant
{
  var f = (Fruit)x; // or x as Fruit
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
var f = x as Fruit;
if (f != null)
{
  // code
}
----

The casting of any typed variable of the ``++is++`` type pattern expression also gets marked as redundant.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (x is Fruit f)
{
  var fruit = (Fruit)f; // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
if (x is Fruit fruit)
{
  // ...
}
