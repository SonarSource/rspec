JNDI supports the deserialization of objects from LDAP directories, which can lead to remote code execution.

This rule raises an issue when an LDAP search query is executed with ``++SearchControls++`` configured to allow deserialization.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The application connects to an untrusted LDAP directory.
* User-controlled objects can be stored in the LDAP directory.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to disable deserialization of LDAP objects.


== Sensitive Code Example

----
DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext();
// ...
ctx.search(query, filter,
        new SearchControls(scope, countLimit, timeLimit, attributes,
            true, // Noncompliant; allows deserialization
            deref));
----


== Compliant Solution

----
DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext();
// ...
ctx.search(query, filter,
        new SearchControls(scope, countLimit, timeLimit, attributes,
            false, // Compliant
            deref));
----
