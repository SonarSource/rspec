The core issue lies in the potential for unintended exposure. Developers may design components with the expectation that
they are only accessible within their application.  However, due to the implicit export behavior in older Android
versions when `android:exported` is not set, these components become publicly accessible without the developer's explicit
configuration. This discrepancy between intended design and actual behavior can create security vulnerabilities, as
components designed for internal use may not have the necessary security measures to handle external, potentially
malicious, interactions.
