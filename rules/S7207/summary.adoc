The `android:exported` attribute in Android Manifest files controls whether a component, for example an activity or
service, can be started by other applications. When `android:exported` is not explicitly set, Android versions prior to
API level 31 implicitly treat the component as if `android:exported="true"` were declared. This implicit export behavior
could potentially lead to unintended access to the component and any data it manages.
