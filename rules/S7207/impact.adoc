=== What is the potential impact?

When an Android component is unintentionally exported, it can expose the application to several potential security and
functional risks. Essentially, components designed for internal application use become accessible to external
applications, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

==== Data exposure and leakage

One significant potential impact is the unintended exposure of sensitive data. If the implicitly exported component
handles or processes user data, personal information, API keys, or other confidential information, a malicious
application could potentially interact with this component to extract or intercept such data. This could lead to privacy
violations, identity theft, or other forms of data breaches, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the exposed
information.

==== Unauthorized execution of functionality

Beyond data exposure, an implicitly exported component can also enable unauthorized execution of application
functionalities. Malicious applications might be able to leverage the exported component to trigger actions or
workflows within your application that were intended for internal use only. This could result in unintended
modifications to application state, bypassing of intended security controls, or even the exploitation of vulnerabilities
within the component's exposed functionality, leading to unpredictable or harmful behavior of the application.
