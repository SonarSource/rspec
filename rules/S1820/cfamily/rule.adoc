== Why is this an issue?

A structure, such as a ``++struct++``, ``++union++`` or ``++class++`` that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain, and having a lot of fields is an indication that a structure has grown too large.


Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the structure into smaller ones that focus on well defined topics.
