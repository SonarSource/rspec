A structure, such as a `+struct+`, `+union+` or `+class+` that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain, and having a lot of fields is an indication that a structure has grown too large.

Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the structure into smaller ones that focus on well defined topics.
