Exceptions handlers (`+catch ()+`) are evaluated in the order they are written. Once a match is found, the evaluation stops. If there is a handler for a base class followed by a handler for class derived from that base class, the second handler will never trigger: The handler for the base class will match the derived class, and will be the only executed handler. The derived class handler is dead code.
