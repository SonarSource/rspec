\[~samuel.mercier], please fix the following:

* Code should be quoted in the message
* Add a See section to the description listing the appropriate MISRA number
* Fill in Applicability. Almost always this is both Sources and Tests
* Make sure the appropriate MISRA C and MISRA {cpp} fields on the references tab are filled in
* The message is worded as though there will be one issue per ``++try++``. Instead, I would recommend/expect one issue per out-of-order ``++catch++``. E.G. Move this "catch" for "xxx" above the "catch" for "yyy".

FYI [~samuel.mercier] I moved this to Reliability because when the ``++catch++`` blocks are out of order, the actions expected for a subtype will never be executed.

Do we need a message for the secondary catch? Right now it's a bit misleading as there is no "conflict" in either cases.

____
A CATCH block handles the exceptions of the exception classes cx_class1 cx_class2 ... that are specified after the statement CATCH as well as the exceptions of the subclasses of these exception classes. In each CATCH statement of a TRY 

control structure, you can list any number of exception classes 

cx_class1 cx_class2 ... , whereby more special exception classes (subclasses) must be listed before more general exception classes (superclasses). This order must be kept both within a CATCH statement and across multiple CATCH statements of a TRY control structure. 


*Latest notes:* The rule whereby CATCH special exception classes must be listed before general classes ensures that an exception is not handled by a general exception handler (superclass) if a special handler (subclass) is provided.
