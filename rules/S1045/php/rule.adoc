Exceptions handlers (``++catch++``) are evaluated in the order they are written. Once a match is found, the evaluation stops.


In some contexts a ``++catch++`` block is dead code as it will never catch any exception:

* If there is a handler for a base class followed by a handler for class derived from that base class, the second handler will never trigger: the handler for the base class will match the derived class, and will be the only executed handler.
* When multiple ``++catch++`` blocks try to catch the same exception class, only the first one will be executed.

This rule raises an issue when a ``++catch++`` block catches every exception before a later ``++catch++`` block could catch it.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyException extends Exception {}
class MySubException extends MyException {}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch (MyException $e) {
  echo $e;
} catch (MySubException $e) { // Noncompliant: MySubException is a subclass of MyException
  echo "Never executed";
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
class MyException extends Exception {}
class MySubException extends MyException {}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch (MySubException $e) {
  echo "Executed";
} catch (MyException $e) {
  echo $e;
}
