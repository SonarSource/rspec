=== Highlighting

Primary:

* All exceptions which will never match because they are subclasses or duplicate of the first exception caught.
* The "except:" statement if "BaseException" is caught before.

Secondary:

* The exception class which shadows other except blocks.
message should be: 'Exceptions will be caught here.'
