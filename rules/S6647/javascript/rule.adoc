== Why is this an issue?

If the class declaration does not include a constructor, one is automatically created, so there is no need to provide an empty constructor, or one that just delegates to the parent class.

[source,javascript]
----
class Foo {
    constructor() {}  // Noncompliant, empty
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    constructor(params) { // Noncompliant, just delegates to the parent
        super(params);
    } 
}
----

Instead, you can safely remove the empty constructor without affecting the functionality.

[source,javascript]
----
class Foo {}

class Bar extends Foo {}
----
