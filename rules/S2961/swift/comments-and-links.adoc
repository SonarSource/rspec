\[~ann.campbell.2] I have 0 issues on ruling for this rule, so backticks are not really used. So I decided to raise issue on every usage of backticked identifier instead of declaration or first backticked usage (as it will not produce a lot of noise and very-very simple to implement). According with it I've updated message and SQALE. Are you ok with that?
