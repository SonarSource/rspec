This rule raises an issue when a test method does not contain any assertion statements or calls to assertion methods.

== Why is this an issue?

Test methods without assertions are problematic for several reasons:

First, they provide no actual validation of the code being tested. A test that executes code but doesn't verify the results gives a false sense of security - it appears that the code is tested, but no actual verification occurs.

Second, missing assertions often indicate incomplete test implementation. Developers may have written the setup code but forgotten to add the verification logic, leaving the test in an unfinished state.

Third, such tests can hide real issues. If the tested code throws an exception, the test will fail, but if it completes without error, the test passes regardless of whether the behavior is correct.

Finally, tests without assertions make it harder to understand what behavior is being verified, reducing the documentation value of the test suite.

=== What is the potential impact?

Tests without assertions provide no actual verification of code behavior, leading to false confidence in test coverage. This can allow bugs to go undetected and makes it difficult to catch regressions when code changes.

== How to fix it in JUnit

Use JUnit assertion methods to verify expected outcomes.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Test
void testUserCreation() { // Noncompliant
    def user = new User("John", "john@example.com")
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Test
void testUserCreation() { // Compliant
    def user = new User("John", "john@example.com")
    assertEquals("John", user.name)
    assertEquals("john@example.com", user.email)
}
----

== How to fix it in Spock

Use Spock's then or expect blocks to define assertions.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def "should process order"() { // Noncompliant
    given:
    def order = new Order(items: ["item1", "item2"])

    when:
    orderService.process(order)
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
def "should process order"() { // Compliant
    given:
    def order = new Order(items: ["item1", "item2"])

    when:
    orderService.process(order)

    then:
    order.status == OrderStatus.PROCESSED
    order.processedAt != null
}
----
