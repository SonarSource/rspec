== Why is this an issue?

An exception (including ``++reject++``) thrown by a promise will not be caught by a nesting ``++try++`` block, due to the asynchronous nature of execution. Instead, use ``++catch++`` method of ``++Promise++`` or wrap it inside ``++await++`` expression.


This rule reports ``++try-catch++`` statements containing nothing else but call(s) to a function returning a ``++Promise++`` (thus it's less likely that ``++catch++`` is intended to catch something else than ``++Promise++`` rejection).


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function runPromise() {
  return Promise.reject("rejection reason");
}

function foo() {
  try { // Noncompliant, the catch clause of the 'try' will not be executed for the code inside promise
    runPromise();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Failed to run promise", e);
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
function foo() {
  runPromise().catch(e => console.log("Failed to run promise", e));
}

// or
async function foo() {
  try {
    await runPromise();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Failed to run promise", e);
  }
}
