Comparing two values of different types with operator ``++===++`` or ``++!==++`` will always return respectively ``++true++`` and ``++false++``. The same is true for operators ``++==++`` and ``++!=++`` when two ``++objects++`` of unrelated types, i.e. one is not a prototype of the other, are compared.


Chai provides assertion functions which use these operators to compare two values. These assertions should not compare values of incompatible types as they would always fail or always succeed.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
const assert = require('chai').assert;
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const should = require('chai').should();

describe("invalid comparisons", function() {

    it("uses chai 'assert'", function() {
        const str = "1";
        const today = new Date();
        const nb = new Number(42);

        // These assertions use non-strict equality. Only unrelated "object" types are considered.
        assert.equal(today, nb);  // Noncompliant. This always fails.
        assert.notEqual(today, nb);  // Noncompliant. This always succeeds.

        // These assertions use strict equality. Unrelated "object" types and primitive types are considered.
        assert.strictEqual(str, 1);  // Noncompliant. This always fails.
        assert.notStrictEqual(str, 1);  // Noncompliant. This always succeeds.

        // Comparing primitive types to objects with == or != is ok
        // even if it is not recommended. Using strict equality is better.
        assert.equal(str, [1]);  // Ok
        assert.notEqual(str, [0]);  // Ok
    });

    it("uses chai 'expect' and 'should'", function() {
        const str = "1";
        // These assertions use strict equality
        expect(str).to.equal(1);  // Noncompliant. This always fails.
        expect(str).to.not.equal(1);  // Noncompliant. This always succeeds.

        str.should.equal(1);  // Noncompliant. This always fails.
        str.should.not.equal(1);  // Noncompliant. This always succeeds.
    });
});
