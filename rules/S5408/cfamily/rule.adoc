== Why is this an issue?

Declaring a function or a static member variable ``++constexpr++`` makes it implicitly inline.


In that situation, explicitly using the ``++inline++`` keyword would be redundant, and might lead to confusion if it's used in some cases but not others. It's better to simply omit it.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
inline constexpr int addOne(int n) { return n+1; } // Noncompliant
struct A {
inline constexpr static int secretNumber = 0; // Noncompliant
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr int addOne(int n) { return n+1; }
struct A {
constexpr static int secretNumber = 0;
};
----

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] What triggered the idea for this rule is: F.5: If a function is very small and time-critical, declare it inline

But since this point is just one line in the core guideline, and a small detail, I don't think it's worth mentioning...
