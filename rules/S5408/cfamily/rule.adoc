== Why is this an issue?

Declaring a function or a static member variable ``++constexpr++`` makes it implicitly inline.


In that situation, explicitly using the ``++inline++`` keyword would be redundant, and might lead to confusion if it's used in some cases but not others. It's better to simply omit it.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
inline constexpr int addOne(int n) { return n+1; } // Noncompliant
struct A {
inline constexpr static int secretNumber = 0; // Noncompliant
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr int addOne(int n) { return n+1; }
struct A {
constexpr static int secretNumber = 0;
};
----
