== Why is this an issue?

Overriding an object changes its behavior and could potentially impact all code using that object. Overriding standard, built-in objects could therefore have broad, potentially catastrophic effects on previously-working code.


This rule detects overrides of the following native objects:

* Fundamental objects - Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol, Error, EvalError, InternalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError
* Numbers and dates - Number, Math, Date
* Text processing - String, RegExp
* Indexed collections - Array, Int8Array, Uint8Array, Uint8ClampedArray, Int16Array, Unit16Array, Int32Array, Uint32Array, Float32Array, Float64Array
* Keyed collections - Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet
* Structured data - ArrayBuffer, DataView, JSON
* Control abstraction objects - Promise
* Reflection - Reflect, Proxy
* Internationalization - Intl
* Non-standard objects - Generator, Iterator, ParallelArray, StopIteration
