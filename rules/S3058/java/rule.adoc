Overriding a parent class' method implementation with an ``++abstract++`` method is a terrible practice for a number of reasons:

* it blocks invocation of the original class' method by children of the ``++abstract++`` class.
* it requires the ``++abstract++`` class' children to re-implement (copy/paste?) the original class' logic.
* it violates the inherited contract.


== Noncompliant Code Example

public class Parent {
  public int getNumber() {
    return 1;
  }
}

public abstract class AbstractChild {
  abstract public int getNumber();  // Noncompliant
}
