The ``SELECT`` statement should be used only to clearly define some new branches in the control flow. As soon as a ``WHEN`` clause contains too many statements this highly decreases the readability of the overall control flow statement. In such case, the content of ``WHEN`` clause should be extracted in a dedicated subroutine.
