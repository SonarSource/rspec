== Why is this an issue?

The ``++SELECT++`` statement should be used only to clearly define some new branches in the control flow. As soon as a ``++WHEN++`` clause contains too many statements this highly decreases the readability of the overall control flow statement. In such case, the content of ``++WHEN++`` clause should be extracted in a dedicated subroutine.
