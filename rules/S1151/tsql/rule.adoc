As soon as a ``++WHEN++`` clause contains too much logic this highly decreases the readability of the overall expression. In such case, the content of the ``++WHEN++`` clause may be extracted into a dedicated function.

== Noncompliant Code Example

With a threshold of 5:

----
SELECT CASE column1
  WHEN 1 THEN
    CASE column2
      WHEN 'a' THEN -- Noncompliant, 7 lines till ELSE
        'x'
      ELSE
        'y'
      END
  ELSE
    42
  END 
FROM table1;
----

== Compliant Solution

----
SELECT CASE
  WHEN column1 = 1 AND column2 = 'a' THEN
    'x'
  WHEN column1 = 1 THEN
    'y'
  ELSE
    42
  END 
FROM table1;
