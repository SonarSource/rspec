The storage layout used for floating-point values may vary from one compiler to another, and therefore no floating-point comparisons or manipulations should be made which rely directly on the way the values are stored. The in-built operators and functions, which hide the storage details from the developer, should be used.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
float32_t My_fabs ( float32_t f )
{
  uint8_t * pB = reinterpret_cast< uint8_t * >( &f );
  *( pB + 3 ) &= 0x7f; // Non-compliant – generate the absolute value of an IEEE-754 float value.
  return f;
}
