GitHub Actions workflows can leverage actions and reusable workflows created by others.
These external actions can be used to perform various tasks, such as checking out code, building applications, and deploying artifacts.
If your workflow uses a third-party action or a workflow without referencing to a specific commit hash, you are at risk of pulling in code that you have not reviewed.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* You trust the author of this third-party action or workflow
* You accept that this third-party action or workflow could change at any time

There is a risk if you answered no to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to use the complete commit hash to pin the version when using third-party actions and workflows.
This is the only way to ensure that the code you are pulling into your action is the one you have reviewed.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: docs/example-action@main  # Sensitive
----

== Compliant Solution

Use the full commit hash as a reference to pin the version.

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
name: Example

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: docs/example-action@b16d2601a6b948e2fb26f3772276581f31daa7cd
