Using the value of a pointer to a ``++FILE++`` object after the associated file is closed is undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

Once a file has been closed, its corresponding ``++FILE*++`` typed variable becomes invalid and the stream may no longer be accessed through this variable.
In particular, a pointer to a ``++FILE++`` object may not be passed to ``++fclose++`` more than once.

Using the value of a pointer to a ``++FILE++`` object after the associated file is closed results in undefined behavior.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int process_file(int print) {
  FILE *f = fopen("example.txt", "r");
  if (!f) {
    perror("fopen() failed");
    return 1;
  }

  if (print) {
    char buffer[256];
    while (fgets(buffer, 256, f)) {
      printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    fclose(f);
  }

  // Further processing ...

  fclose(f); // Noncompliant: file associated with `f` might already be closed.
  return 0;
}
----

== What is the potential impact?

If a pointer to a ``++FILE++`` object is used after the associated file is closed, the behavior of the application is undefined.

When a program comprises undefined behavior, the compiler no longer needs to adhere to the language standard, and the program has no meaning assigned to it.
The application might just crash, but in the worst case, the application may appear to execute correctly, while losing data or producing incorrect results.


== How to fix it

Do not use the value of a pointer to a ``++FILE++`` object after the associated file has been closed.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int process_file(int print) {
  FILE *f = fopen("example.txt", "r");
  if (!f) {
    perror("fopen() failed");
    return 1;
  }

  if (print) {
    char buffer[256];
    while (fgets(buffer, 256, f)) {
      printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    fclose(f);
  }

  fclose(f); // Noncompliant: file associated with `f` might already be closed.
  return 0;

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int close_stdout() {
  if (fclose(stdout) == EOF) {
    return 1;
  }
  printf("closed stdout stream!\n"); // Noncompliant: `printf` uses stdout, which was closed.
  return 0;
}

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int close_stdout() {
  if (fclose(stdout) == EOF) {
    return 1;
  }
  fprintf(stderr, "closed stdout stream!\n"); // Compliant: printing to `stderr` is fine.
  return 0;
