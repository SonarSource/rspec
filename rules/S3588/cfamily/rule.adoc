== Why is this an issue?

Using the value of a pointer to a ``++FILE++`` object after the associated file is closed is undefined behavior.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void fun() {
  FILE * pFile;
  pFile = fopen(fileName, "w");

  if (condition) {
    fclose(pFile);
    // ...
  }

  fclose(pFile); // Noncompliant, the file has already been closed
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void fun() {
  FILE * pFile;
  pFile = fopen(fileName, "w");

  if (condition) {
    // ...
  }

  fclose(pFile);
}
----
