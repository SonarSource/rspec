== Why is this an issue?

``++calc++`` is a CSS3 function that provides the possibility to do simple math in CSS (add, subtract, divide, multiply). Without spaces around operators, ``++calc++`` will have no effect.


More precisely, before an operator, there must be a single whitespace or a newline plus indentation. After an operator, there must be a single whitespace or a newline.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,css]
----
#div1 {
    position: absolute;
    width: calc(100%- 100px); /* Noncompliant; no space after the % sign */
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,css]
----
#div1 {
    position: absolute;
    width: calc(100% - 100px);
}
