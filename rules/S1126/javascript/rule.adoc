== Why is this an issue?

Wrapping a boolean expression in an ``++if...else++`` statement and returning true or false in the respective blocks is redundant and unnecessary. It can also make the code harder to maintain, as it adds unnecessary lines of code that need to be read and understood. 

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (expression) {  
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
----

Simplify the code and return the boolean expression directly to make the code more concise and easier to read and maintain.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
return expression; 
----

If the caller expects a boolean and the result of the expression is not a boolean, use double negation for proper conversion.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
return !!expression;
