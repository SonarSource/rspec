== Why is this an issue?

The ``++if...else++`` statement is used to make decisions based on the truthiness of a boolean expression, and the ``++if++`` block executes when the expression is ``++true++``, while the ``++else++`` block executes when the expression is false.

Wrapping a boolean expression in an ``++if...else++`` statement and returning ``++true++`` or ``++false++`` in the respective blocks is redundant and unnecessary. It can also make the code harder to maintain, as it adds unnecessary lines of code that need to be read and understood. 

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (expression) {  
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
----

Simplify the code and return the boolean expression (or its negation) directly to make the code more concise and easier to read and maintain.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
return expression; 
----

If the caller expects a boolean and the result of the expression is not a boolean, use double negation for proper conversion.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
return !!expression;
