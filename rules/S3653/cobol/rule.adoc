== Why is this an issue?

There is such a thing as software that's too helpful, and that's the case with DB2's implicit casting of host variables used in ``++WHERE++`` clauses. If for instance you compare a varchar column with the value of a numeric host variable, starting with version 10, DB2 will silently convert the numeric value to a string - at a potentially huge performance cost. 


This rule raises an issue when the type of a variable used with a SQL ``++WHERE++`` clause does not match the underlying type of the column to which it is compared.
