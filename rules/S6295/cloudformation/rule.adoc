== Why is this an issue?

Log streams created on AWS will stay forever unless the `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` to which they belong to was configured with a retention policy.
`Log Groups` should have their “RetentionInDays” property set with a valid value to be sure the log events are kept only for the expected duration.

When the property is not set, the log events will be kept for ever or will be deleted only when the Log Group is removed.

Keeping the logs for ever doesn't come for free: AWS will charge for keeping these logs.
Also from a security point of view, keeping the data for ever may be not compliant with company policy or regulatory rules.

Note: this rule doesn't check if the value provided to "RetentionInDays" is valid because AWS CloudFormation Linter (cfn-lint) do it already

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,yaml]
----
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs12.x
      Description: Example of Lambda Function    

  MyFunctionLogGroup:                        
    Type: AWS::Logs::LogGroup                                                                                                                         
    Properties:
      LogGroupName: !Join ['/', ['/aws/lambda', !Ref MyLambdaFunction]]
      # Noncompliant: "RetentionInDays" property is not set: logs are kept for ever

=== Compliant solution

[source,yaml]
----
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs12.x
      Description: Example of Lambda Function
      
  MyFunctionLogGroup:
    Type: AWS::Logs::LogGroup
    Properties:
      LogGroupName: !Join ['/', ['/aws/lambda', !Ref MyLambdaFunction]]
      RetentionInDays: 30
