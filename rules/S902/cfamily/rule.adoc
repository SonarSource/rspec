== Why is this an issue?

Functions or methods that are not called may be symptomatic of a serious problem, such as missing paths.Â 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
static void unusedStaticFunction() { // Noncompliant: function is never used
}

namespace test {
  namespace { 
    class A {
      void f(); // Noncompliant: member function is never used
    }; 
  }

  void g(A a); // Noncompliant: function is never used
}
----


== Resources

* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 0-1-10 - Every defined function shall be called at least once.
