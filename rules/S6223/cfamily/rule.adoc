== Why is this an issue?

Despite their names, the standard remove algorithms (`std::remove`, `std::remove_if`, `std::unique`) do not erase elements from a given range.
Instead, they shift the preserved (not removed) elements to the beginning of the range and return an iterator after the last preserved element.
The "removed" elements have unspecified values.

{cpp}20 introduced functions in the `std::ranges` namespace with the same names.
Aside from returning a subrange instead of an iterator, they exhibit the same behavior.

Ignoring the result of any of these functions indicates a bug: operations on the container may access elements with unspecified values.
This may lead to invalid program states, data corruption, or crashes.

== How to fix it

The rule raises an issue when the result of `remove`, `remove_if`, or `unique` from the `std` or `std::ranges` namespace is ignored.

There are essentially three ways to fix this problem:

. Use the returned iterator or subrange to consider only the relevant elements. +
  This solution can be sufficient.
  It is also efficient but non-trivial and error-prone, as explained in the first example below.
. Use the _erase-remove_ idiom to drop elements from a container. +
  It consists of calling the container's `erase` member function using the produced iterator or subrange.
. Use other algorithms:
* Since {cpp}20, `remove` and `remove_if` can be replaced with the free functions `std::erase` and `std::erase_if`, respectively.
* The member functions of `std::list` and `std::forward_list` of the same name _do_ erase the desired elements from the container.
* `std::remove_copy` and `std::remove_copy_if` (and their `std::ranges` siblings) avoid the problem by copying the relevant values to another container. +
  This solution requires more memory and usually requires more computation since elements are not moved but copied.
* `std::partition` and `std::stable_partition` (and their `std::ranges` siblings) reorder elements inside the same container without resulting in unspecified values.

Which technique to use depends on the context, as we illustrate with the following examples.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

This first example takes a collection of names, filters out the invalid ones, and returns the longest.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
char const* longestName(std::vector<char const*> names) {
  // Noncompliant: some elements in "names" are left with an unspecified value.
  std::remove(names.begin(), names.end(), nullptr);

  if (names.empty()) { // Flaw: invalid names are still in the container.
    // No valid names.
    return nullptr;
  }

  auto longestNameIterator = std::max_element(
    names.begin(), names.end(), // Flaw: unspecified values are iterated over.
    [](auto f1, auto f2) {
      // Undefined behavior:
      // * accessing unspecified elements
      // * potentially dereferencing null pointers
      return std::strlen(f1) < std::strlen(f2);
    }
  );
  return *longestNameIterator;
}
----

As explained in the comments, this code is flawed and can result in a crash.

==== Compliant solution

To fix the flaws of the previous code snippet,
we can use the value returned by `std::remove` to consider only the relevant elements.
This solution is sufficient because the container `names` is getting destroyed at the end of the function.
Therefore, there is no risk of accessing unspecified values in other parts of the software.
Furthermore, this solution is efficient as it does not perform unnecessary work on the container.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
char const* longestName(std::vector<char const*> names) {
  // Compliant: the returned iterator is used to limit the subsequent search.
  auto end = std::remove(names.begin(), names.end(), nullptr);

  if (end == names.begin()) { // Correct: invalid names are not considered.
    // No valid names.
    return nullptr;
  }

  auto longestNameIterator = std::max_element(
    names.begin(), end, // Correct: only valid names are iterated over.
    [](auto f1, auto f2) {
      return std::strlen(f1) < std::strlen(f2);
    }
  );
  return *longestNameIterator;
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

The following example looks like it removes even values from a given vector passed by reference.
In fact, the vector `v` is left with the same number of elements.

[source,cpp]
----
void filterOutEvenNumbers(std::vector<int>& v) {
  // Noncompliant: some elements in "v" have an unspecified value.
  std::remove_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x) { return x % 2 == 0; });
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Here are two ways of fixing the bug in the previous snippet:

* With {cpp}20, `std::remove_if` can be replaced by `std::erase_if`:
+
[source,cpp]
----
void filterOutEvenNumbers(std::vector<int>& v) {
  // Compliant: elements are erased as expected.
  std::erase_if(v, [](int x) { return x % 2 == 0; });
}
----
+
This solution is sufficient, reliable, and more readable than the original code.

* Before {cpp}20, we can apply the _erase-remove_ idiom and use the `erase` member function of the container:
+
[source,cpp]
----
void filterOutEvenNumbers(std::vector<int>& v) {
  auto newEnd = std::remove_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x) { return x % 2 == 0; });
  // Compliant: elements are erased as expected.
  v.erase(newEnd, v.end());
}
----
+
This solution is semantically identical to the {cpp}20 version but more verbose.

==== Noncompliant code example

This example shows an incorrect use of the `std::ranges::unique` function:
`v` is left with indeterminate values.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void removeDuplicateValues(std::vector<int>& v) {
  std::ranges::sort(v);
  // Noncompliant: some elements in "v" have an unspecified value.
  std::ranges::unique(v);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

We apply the _remove-erase_ idiom in this fixed version using the subrange returned by `std::ranges::unique`.

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
void removeDuplicateValues(std::vector<int>& v) {
  std::ranges::sort(v);
  // Compliant: the returned range is used to erase duplicated elements.
  auto [duplicateBegin, duplicateEnd] = std::ranges::unique(v);
  v.erase(duplicateBegin, duplicateEnd);
}
----
