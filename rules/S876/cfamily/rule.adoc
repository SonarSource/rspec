== Why is this an issue?

Applying the unary minus operator to an unsigned variable or expression will always yield another unsigned expression. More plainly, in some cases the operation itself is meaningless, and in some other cases the result will be unexpected. In all cases it is bad practice. Therefore the unary minus operator should not be applied to unsigned variables or expressions.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
uint8_t a = -1U;
int32_t b = -a; // Noncompliant; b is assigned -255 
uint32_t c = 1U; 
int64_t d = -c; // Noncompliant; d is assigned MAX_UINT
----


=== Exceptions

This rule ignores ``++-1U++`` because it is commonly used as shorthand for ``++MAX_UINT++``.
