== Why is this an issue?

Applying the unary minus operator to an unsigned variable or expression will always yield another unsigned expression. More plainly, in some cases the operation itself is meaningless, and in some other cases the result will be unexpected. In all cases it is bad practice. Therefore the unary minus operator should not be applied to unsigned variables or expressions.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
uint8_t a = -1U;
int32_t b = -a; // Noncompliant; b is assigned -255 
uint32_t c = 1U; 
int64_t d = -c; // Noncompliant; d is assigned MAX_UINT
----


=== Exceptions

This rule ignores ``++-1U++`` because it is commonly used as shorthand for ``++MAX_UINT++``.


== Resources

* MISRA C:2004, 12.9 - The unary minus operator shall not be applied to an expression whose underlying type is unsigned.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 5-3-2 - The unary minus operator shall not be applied to an expression whose underlying type is unsigned.
* MISRA C:2012, 10.1 - Operands shall not be of an inappropriate essential type

Provided solution is not compliant - unary minus is still applied on unsiged expression "1U". Clang emits warning in both cases:

{noformat}

// defines "uint8_t" as "unsigned char" and "int8_t" as "signed char":

#include <stdint.h>


uint8_t b = - 1U; // warning: implicit conversion from 'unsigned int' to 'uint8_t' (aka 'unsigned char') changes value from 4294967295 to 255

int8_t a = - 1U; // warning: implicit conversion from 'unsigned int' to 'int8_t' (aka 'signed char') changes value from 4294967295
