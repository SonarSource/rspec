Provided solution is not compliant - unary minus is still applied on unsiged expression "1U". Clang emits warning in both cases:

// defines "uint8_t" as "unsigned char" and "int8_t" as "signed char":

#include <stdint.h>


uint8_t b = - 1U; // warning: implicit conversion from 'unsigned int' to 'uint8_t' (aka 'unsigned char') changes value from 4294967295 to 255
