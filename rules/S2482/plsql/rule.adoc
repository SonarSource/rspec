Labeled loops are useful, especially when the code is badly indented, to match the begin and end of each loop. Within a labeled loop, the code's maintainability is increased by explicitly providing the loop's label in every ``++EXIT++`` statement. Indeed, if a nested loop is added afterwards, it is clear which loop has to be exited.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
BEGIN
  <<myLoopLabel1>>
  LOOP
    EXIT; -- Noncompliant, the loop label is missing
  END LOOP myLoopLabel1;

  LOOP
    EXIT; -- Compliant, this EXIT is not in a labeled loop
  END LOOP;
END;
/
----


== Compliant Solution

----
BEGIN
 <<myLoopLabel1>>
  LOOP
    EXIT myLoopLabel1;
  END LOOP myLoopLabel1;

  LOOP
    EXIT;
  END LOOP;
END;
