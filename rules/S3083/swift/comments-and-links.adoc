\[~elena.vilchik] I know you'll probably want to update the code samples. I included the ones here as a starting point.

\[~ann.campbell.2] please, have a look at code examples

\[~elena.vilchik], assuming I'm reading this right, the Noncompliant and Compliant samples show completely different operators. The Compliant Solution needs to be a "fixed" version of the Noncompliant Example, not completely different code that happens to pass.

\[~ann.campbell.2] that exactly what i was trying to do :) if you want operator which subtracts values but has right associativity, then create your custom operator ("<-" in my example). For custom operator it's required to declare function which defines its action (there is no need for such function for standard operators). And we need another message, not clause should be removed, but whole statement. May be "Remove this operator declaration."?

after our collaboration [~elena.vilchik], I think we're both happy.
