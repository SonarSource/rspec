== Why is this an issue?

In Unix file system permissions, the \"``++others++``" category refers to all
users except the owner of the file system resource and the members of the group
assigned to this resource.

Granting permissions to this category can lead to unintended access to files or
directories that could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information, disrupt
services or elevate privileges.
