In Unix file system permissions, the \"``++others++``" category refers to all users except the owner of the file system resource and the members of the group assigned to this resource.

Granting permissions to this category can lead to unintended access to files or directories that could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information, disrupt services or elevate privileges.
