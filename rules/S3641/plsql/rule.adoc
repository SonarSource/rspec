== Why is this an issue?

A WHERE clause condition that uses NOT IN with a subquery will have unexpected results if that subquery returns NULL. On the other hand NOT EXISTS subqueries work reliably under the same conditions.

This rule raises an issue when NOT IN is used with a subquery where the selected column is nullable.


*Noteworthy*

This rule raises issues only when a *Data Dictionary* is provided during the analysis. See https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/plsql/
