== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to password-encrypt local databases that contain sensitive information. Most systems provide secure alternatives to plain-text storage that should be used. If no secure alternative is available the data can also be encrypted manually before it is stored.

The encryption password should not be hard-coded in the application. There are different approaches how the password can be provided to encrypt and decrypt the database. In the case of `EncryptedSharedPreferences` the Android Keystore can be used to store the password. Other databases can rely on `EncryptedSharedPreferences` to store passwords. The password can also be provided dynamically by the user of the application or it can be fetched from a remote server if the other methods are not feasible.
