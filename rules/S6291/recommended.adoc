== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to password-encrypt local databases that contain sensitive information. Most systems provide secure alternatives to plain-text storage that should be used. If no secure alternative is available the data can also be encrypted manually before it is stored.

The password should not be hard-coded in the application. It can be provided by the user of the application or it can be fetched from a remote server.
