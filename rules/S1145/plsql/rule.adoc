``++IF++`` statements with conditions that are always false have the effect of making blocks of code non-functional. This can be useful during debugging, but should not be checked in. ``++IF++`` statements with conditions that are always true are completely redundant, and make the code less readable. In either case, unconditional ``++IF++`` statements should be removed.

== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,sql]
----
IF TRUE THEN
  do_something;
END IF;

IF FALSE THEN
  do_something_else;
END IF;
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,sql]
----
do_something;
