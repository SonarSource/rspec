==== Disabling introspection

The GraphQL server framework should be instructed to disable introspection. This
prevents any attempt to retrieve schema information from the server at runtime.

Each GraphQL framework will have a different method of doing this, possibly
including:

* Changing a simple boolean setting.
* Adding a middleware module to the request processing chain.
* Adding a GraphQL validator that rejects introspection keywords.

If introspection is required, it should only be made available to the smallest
possible audience. This could include development environments, users with a
specific right, or requests from a specific set of IP addresses.
