\[~ann.campbell.2] Is it a bug or a code smell?

If we are careful about potential noise, I think we should either:

* raise issues in all cases and consider this rule as a code smell
* only raise issues when the intent of the developer is clearly not what the code does and consider the rule as a bug

If we go for the 2nd option, we can maybe check how the code is formatted:

----
DECLARE X,Y FIXED BIN(15); // Noncompliant
DECLARE 
 X,
 Y FIXED BIN(15); // compliant
----
