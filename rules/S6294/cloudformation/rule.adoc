== Why is this an issue?

Some AWS services create `Log Groups` implicitly and don’t let the developer choose the `Log Group` name. This means that CloudFormation does not require the developer to declare the `Log Group` that the resource will write to.

If a `Log Group` is not declared within CloudFormation, then this `Log Group` will be automatically created at run time and it won’t be managed by CloudFormation. The consequences are that the:

* `Log Group` will not be removed when the `Stack` is removed.
* `Log Group` attributes (such as retention) won’t be managed "as code" within CloudFormation.

These automatically created `Log Groups` will remain forever which can have huge impact on costs and security (the data stay forever while this is unexpected from company or regulatory rules).

A good practice is to declare the target `Log Group` with CloudFormation, matching the name that the AWS will use so that the `Log Group` resource is managed as code.

This rule applies to the following resources:

* AWS::Lambda::Function
* AWS::Serverless::Function 
* AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api
* AWS::CodeBuild::Project

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,yaml]
----
  # There is no "Log Group" declared corresponding to "MyLambdaFunction": logs will not be managed by CloudFormation
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs12.x
      Description: Example of Lambda Function
----

=== Compliant solution

Example with Ref

[source,yaml]
----
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs12.x
      Description: Example of Lambda Function
      
  MyFunctionLogGroup:
    Type: AWS::Logs::LogGroup
    Properties:
      LogGroupName: !Join ['/', ['/aws/lambda', !Ref MyLambdaFunction]]
      RetentionInDays: 30

Example with Sub

[source,yaml]
----
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs12.x
      Description: Example of Lambda Function
      
  MyFunctionLogGroupSub:        
    Type: AWS::Logs::LogGroup
    Properties:
      LogGroupName: !Sub '/aws/lambda/${MyLambdaFunction}’
