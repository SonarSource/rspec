<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitLab tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes.
They are essentially access credentials that allow users or applications to
interact with the GitLab API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a GitLab token, you can perform various operations such as creating,
reading, updating, and deleting resources like repositories, issues, merge
requests, and more. Tokens can also be scoped to limit the permissions and
actions that can be performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A leaked GitLab token can have significant consequences for the security and
integrity of the associated account and resources. It exposes the account to
unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and malicious actions.
The unintended audience can exploit the leaked token to gain unauthorized entry
into the GitLab account, allowing them to view, modify, or delete repositories,
issues, and other resources. This unauthorized access can result in the exposure
of sensitive data, such as proprietary code, customer information, or
confidential documents, leading to potential data breaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, the unintended audience can perform malicious actions within the account,
introducing vulnerabilities, injecting malicious code, or tampering with
settings. This can compromise the security of the account and the integrity of
the software development process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, a leaked token can enable the
unintended audience to take control of the GitLab account, potentially changing
passwords, modifying settings, and adding or removing collaborators. This
account takeover can disrupt development and collaboration workflows, causing
reputational damage and operational disruptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, the impact of a
leaked token extends beyond the immediate account compromise. It can have
regulatory and compliance implications, requiring organizations to report the
breach, notify affected parties, and potentially face legal and financial
consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the compromise of a GitLab token would lead to consequences referred to as supply chain attacks that can affect more than one&#8217;s own organization.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
