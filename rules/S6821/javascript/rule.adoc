== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/jsts/aria-intro-1.adoc[]

This rule checks that when using the `role` property in DOM elements, its value is a valid non-abstract ARIA role.

This rule does not cover non-DOM elements, such as custom components.

== How to fix it in JSX

Check that each element with a defined ARIA role has a valid non-abstract value.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<div role="meth" aria-label="a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}">
  a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
</div>
----

To fix the code use a valid value for the ARIA role attribute.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<div role="math" aria-label="a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}">
  a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
</div>
