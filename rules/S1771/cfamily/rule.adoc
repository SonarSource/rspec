While it is possible to define a ``++struct++`` with member functions in {cpp}, the general expectation is that ``++struct++``s only aggregate data, while classes are used for fully encapsulated abstractions, containing data and methods. Thus, including a member function in a ``++struct++`` is likely to lead to confusion at best and should be avoided.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
struct S
{
  S(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
  int x;
  int y;
  public: 
    int fun(); // Noncompliant
}; 
----


== Compliant Solution

----
struct S
{
  S(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
  int x;
  int y;
}; 
----


== Exceptions

* Constructors are ignored for this rule, because they are the only way that a ``++struct++`` designer can enforce that all fields of a ``++struct++`` are correctly initialized.
* Overload of the function operator '()'. It is a common practice to use struct as a functor.
