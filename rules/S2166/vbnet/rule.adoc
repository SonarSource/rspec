=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Public Class FruitException ' Noncompliant - this has nothing to do with Exception
    Private expected As Fruit
    Private unusualCharacteristics As String
    Private appropriateForCommercialExploitation As Boolean
    ' ...
End Class

Public Class CarException ' Noncompliant - does not derive from any Exception-based class
    Public Sub New(message As String, inner As Exception)
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Public Class FruitSport ' Compliant - class name does not end with 'Exception'
    Private expected As Fruit
    Private unusualCharacteristics As String
    Private appropriateForCommercialExploitation As Boolean
    ' ...
End Class

Public Class CarException Inherits Exception ' Compliant - correctly extends System.Exception
    Public Sub New(message As String, inner As Exception)
        MyBase.New(message, inner)
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
