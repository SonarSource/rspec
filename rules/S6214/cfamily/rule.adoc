Comparison between ``++signed++`` and ``++unsigned++`` integers is dangerous because it produces counterintuitive results outside of their common range of values.


When a signed integer is compared to an unsigned one, the former might be converted to unsigned. The conversion preserves the two's-complement bit pattern of the signed value that often corresponds to a large unsigned result. For example, ``++2U < -1++`` is ``++true++``.


{cpp}20 introduced remedy to this common pitfall: a family of ``++std::cmp_*++`` functions defined in the ``++<utility>++`` header. These functions correctly handle negative numbers and lossy integer conversion. For example, ``++std::cmp_less(2U, -1)++`` is ``++false++``.


This rule reports comparisons between signed and unsigned integers that involve negative numbers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
bool less = 2U < -1; // Noncompliant

unsigned x = 1;
signed y = -1;
if (x < y) { // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
bool less = std::cmp_less(2U, -1); // Compliant

unsigned x = 1;
signed y = -1;
if (std::cmp_less(x, y)) { // Compliant
  // ...
}

bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return std::cmp_less(x, v.size()); // Compliant
}

std::vector<int> v = foo();
if (0 < v.size() && v.size() < 100) { // Compliant, even though v.size() returns an unsigned integer
}
----
