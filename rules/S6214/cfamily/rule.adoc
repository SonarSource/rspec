Compare integers of mixed signedness safely using `std::cmp_*` functions to avoid any unexpected results.

== Why is this an issue?

Comparison between `signed` and `unsigned` integers is dangerous because it produces counter-intuitive results due to implicit conversions.
When a signed integer is compared to an unsigned one, the former might be converted to unsigned.
Since {cpp}20, the conversion preserves the two's-complement bit pattern of the signed value that always corresponds to a large unsigned result.
For example, `2U < -1` is `true`.

This rule raises an issue when an unsigned integer is compared with a negative value.

=== What is the potential impact

Integer comparisons are often used in branch and loop conditions.
An unexpected result from one of these conditions can lead to hard-to-detect issues, such as unexpected infinite loops.

For example, using container size functions in a comparison can lead to such a problem since these return an unsigned integer value.

== How to fix it

{cpp}20 introduced a remedy to this common pitfall: a family of `std::cmp_*` functions defined in the `<utility>` header.
These functions correctly handle negative numbers and lossy integer conversion.
For example, `std::cmp_less(2U, -1)` is `false`.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
bool less = 2U < -1; // Noncompliant

unsigned x = 1;
signed y = -1;
if (x < y) { // Noncompliant
  // ...
}

bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return x < v.size(); // Noncompliant: if x is negative, it is converted to unsigned, losing its value.
}

std::vector<int> v = foo();
if (-1 < v.size() && v.size() < 100) { // Noncompliant: -1 < v.size() is false for all sizes.
                                       // -1 converted to unsigned is larger than any int value
}
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
bool less = std::cmp_less(2U, -1); // Compliant

unsigned x = 1;
signed y = -1;
if (std::cmp_less(x, y)) { // Compliant
  // ...
}

bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return std::cmp_less(x, v.size()); // Compliant
}

std::vector<int> v = foo();
if (0 <= v.size() && v.size() < 100) { // Compliant, even though v.size() returns an unsigned integer
}
