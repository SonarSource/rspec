== Why is this an issue?

By convention, constructor function names should start with an upper case letter as a reminder that they should be called with the ``++new++`` keyword.


A function is considered to be a constructor when it sets all of its arguments as object properties, and returns no value.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function person (firstName, middleInitial, lastName) {  // Noncompliant
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.middleInitial = middleInitial;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
function Person (firstName, middleInitial, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.middleInitial = middleInitial;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}
----
