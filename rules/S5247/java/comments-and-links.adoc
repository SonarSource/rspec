Other template engine considered, but discarded because they do not have a way to disable the escaping globally:

Auto-escaping is the default. It is not possible to disable it globally in the Java code, https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html#unescaped-text[un-escaped text] can be done only in the HTML file.


* https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java[JMustache by spullara]:
Same as Thymleaf. In addition, it is possible https://groups.google.com/g/mustachejava/c/7qh3Ar8MHsc/m/zKc2fvdPAQAJ[to overwrite the behavior by overwriting "encode()" method], but this seems like a workaround and is really not likely to be done by inadvertance without knowing what you are doing.


* https://pebbletemplates.io/[Pebble Templates]
https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/guide/escaping/[Auto-escaping enabled by default]. Only possible to disable it via the https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/filter/raw/[raw filter], not globally in the Java code.
