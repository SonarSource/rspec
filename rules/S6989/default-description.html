<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adafruit IO provides an API that allows you to interact with IoT devices. The
API can be used to store data, trigger webhook notifications, or modify the
layout and information shown on user dashboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_exceeding_rate_limits">Exceeding rate limits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a leaked secret, an attacker may be able to make hundreds or thousands of
authenticated calls to an online service. It is common for online services to
enforce a rate limit to prevent their servers from being overwhelmed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an attacker is able to exceed a user-based rate limit, they may be able to
cause a denial of service for the user. If this continues over a long period of
time, the user may also be subject to additional fees or may have their account
terminated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_chaining_of_vulnerabilities">Chaining of vulnerabilities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Triggering arbitrary workflows can lead to problems ranging from a denial of
service to worse, depending on how the webhook&#8217;s data is handled. If the
webhook performs a specific action that is affected by a vulnerability, the
webhook acts as a remote attack vector on the enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Components affected by this webhook could, for example, experience unexpected
failures or excessive resource consumption. If it is a single point of failure
(SPOF), this leak is critical.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_modification_of_application_data">Modification of application data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications may rely on data that cannot be distributed with the application
code. This may be due to the size of the data, or because the data is regularly
updated. This data is downloaded by the application as it is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an attacker can gain access to an authentication secret, they may be able to
alter or delete this application data. This may cause parts of the application
to misbehave or stop working. Maliciously altered data could also contain
undesirable content which results in reputational damage.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
