Feedback [~ann.campbell.2]:

* As obvious as this rule can be, I would add some "Noncompliant/Compliant" sections
* Even if this rule is classified in the "Security" category I would decrease the severity to "Minor" or "Major" as the risk to have an HTML comment containing a sensitive information remains low
* We should decide if we want to use bullet points or table for the See section
