== Why is this an issue?

Comparing the value to itself may be either a refactoring error or an outdated way of checking if the value is of a numeric data type but not a valid number. This special numeric value is represented by `NaN` global property, where `NaN` stands for "Not-a-Number". `NaN` is returned as a result when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function is performed, and the result is undefined or unrepresentable as a valid number.

Detecting whether a value is `NaN` in JavaScript was previously problematic because of the way `NaN` behaves in comparison operations. `NaN` is not equal to any value, including itself, so comparing the value to `NaN` will always return false. In other words, if a value is not equal to itself, it can only be `NaN`.

This method of detecting `NaN` can be confusing and should be avoided. ES6 introduced a special function `Number.isNaN()` which only returns `true` if the argument is `NaN` value. For clarity and consistency this function should be used to detect `NaN` instead of all other methods.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (value !== value){ // Noncompliant: use Number.isNaN()
    processNaN(value); 
}
----

To fix your code replace self-comparison with `Number.isNaN()` function.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (Number.isNaN(value)){
    processNaN(value); 
}
----

Do not confuse `Number.isNaN()` with the legacy global `isNaN()` function. While they serve a similar purpose, the behavior is very different - the global `isNaN()` tries to convert its argument into a number before checking if it is `NaN`. If the argument cannot be converted into a number, `isNaN()` will return true, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

[source,javascript]
----
isNaN('some text');          // true: Number('some text') returns NaN
Number.isNaN('some text');   // false: 'some text' is not NaN
----

You should use the `Number.isNaN()` method over `isNaN()` to perform a strict check for `NaN` without any type conversion.

If the intention was not to detect whether a value was NaN, fix the issue by not comparing the variable against itself.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (value !== anotherValue){ 
    // ...
}
