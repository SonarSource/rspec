== Why is this an issue?

Template strings allow developers to embed variables or expressions in strings using template literals, instead of string concatenation. This is done by using expressions like ``++${variable} ++`` in a string between two back-ticks (``++`++``). However, when used in a regular string literal (between double or single quotes) the template will not be evaluated and will be used as a literal, which is probably not what was intended.
