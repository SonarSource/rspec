== Why is this an issue?

A naming convention in software development is a set of guidelines for naming code elements like variables, functions, and classes. +
{identifier_capital_plural} hold the meaning of the written code. Their names should be meaningful and follow a consistent and easily recognizable pattern. +
Adhering to a consistent naming convention helps to make the code more readable and understandable, which makes it easier to maintain and debug.
It also ensures consistency in the code, especially when multiple developers are working on the same project.

This rule checks that {identifier} names match a provided regular expression.
