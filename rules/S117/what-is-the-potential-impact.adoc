=== What is the potential impact?

Inconsistent naming of {identifier_plural} can lead to several issues in your code:

Reduced Readability: When {identifier} names are inconsistent, it can make the code harder to read and understand, making it more difficult to identify the purpose of each variable, spot errors, or comprehend the logic.

Difficulty in Identifying Variables: If {identifier_plural} are not named according to a standard convention, it can be challenging to identify them quickly. It can slow the coding process, especially when dealing with a large codebase.

Increased Risk of Errors: Inconsistent or unclear {identifier} names can lead to misunderstandings about what the variable represents. This ambiguity can lead to incorrect assumptions and, consequently, bugs in the code.

Collaboration Difficulties: In a team setting, inconsistent naming conventions can lead to confusion and miscommunication among team members.

Difficulty in Code Maintenance: Inconsistent naming can lead to an inconsistent codebase. The code can be difficult to understand, and making changes might feel like refactoring all the time, as you will face different naming methods. It makes the codebase harder to maintain.

In summary, not adhering to a naming convention for {identifier_plural} can lead to confusion, errors, and inefficiencies, making the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.
