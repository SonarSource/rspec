=== What is the potential impact?

Inconsistent naming of {identifier_plural} can lead to several issues in your code:

* *Reduced Readability*: Inconsistent {identifier} names make the code harder to read and understand; consequently, it is more difficult to identify the purpose of each variable, spot errors, or comprehend the logic.

* *Difficulty in Identifying Variables*: The {identifier_plural} that don't adhere to a standard naming convention are challenging to identify; thus, the coding process slows down, especially when dealing with a large codebase.

* *Increased Risk of Errors*: Inconsistent or unclear {identifier} names lead to misunderstandings about what the variable represents. This ambiguity leads to incorrect assumptions and, consequently, bugs in the code.

* *Collaboration Difficulties*: In a team setting, inconsistent naming conventions lead to confusion and miscommunication among team members.

* *Difficulty in Code Maintenance*: Inconsistent naming leads to an inconsistent codebase. The code is difficult to understand, and making changes feels like refactoring constantly, as you face different naming methods. Ultimately, it makes the codebase harder to maintain.

In summary, not adhering to a naming convention for {identifier_plural} can lead to confusion, errors, and inefficiencies, making the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.
