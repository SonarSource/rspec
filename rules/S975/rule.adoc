== Why is this an issue?

It is undefined behavior if the '\' character is used between ``++<++`` and ``++>++`` delimiters or between the ``++"++`` delimiters in a header name preprocessing token.


Note that this rule is only advisory, since some environments use '\' as a file name delimiter. However, compilers for those environments often support the use of '/' in ``++#include++`` directives.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
#include "foo\bar.h" /* Noncompliant */
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
#include "foo/bar.h" /* Compliant */
----
