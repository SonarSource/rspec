The fact Mcrypt is deprecated in PHP 7.1 and removed in PHP 7.2 doesn't prevent us to catch this pattern to help developers still relying on it to know that their code is not secure.

\[~alexandre.gigleux] I agree that we should detect also deprecated function calls, however I would refrain for using them in compliant code example (to avoid anybody blaming us that we recommended deprecated crypto). Either we can use ``++openssl_encrypt++`` \http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-encrypt.php  , or drop compliant example completely
