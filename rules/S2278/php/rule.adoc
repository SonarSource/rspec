== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
<?php
  $ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $plaintext, $mode); // Noncompliant
  // ...
  $ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES_COMPAT, $key, $plaintext, $mode); // Noncompliant
  // ...
  $ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_TRIPLEDES, $key, $plaintext, $mode); // Noncompliant
  // ...
  $ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_3DES, $key, $plaintext, $mode); // Noncompliant

  $cipher = "des-ede3-cfb";  // Noncompliant
  $ciphertext_raw = openssl_encrypt($plaintext, $cipher, $key, $options=OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv);
?>

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
<?php
  $ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $plaintext, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);
?>

It seems that http://php.net/manual/en/intro.mcrypt.php[Mcrypt is deprecated] in PHP 7.1 and removed in PHP 7.2.

The fact Mcrypt is deprecated in PHP 7.1 and removed in PHP 7.2 doesn't prevent us to catch this pattern to help developers still relying on it to know that their code is not secure.

I also added DES when used with openssl_encrypt(...), as described here \https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39467008/use-openssl-encrypt-to-replace-mcrypt-for-3des-ecb-encryption


\[~alexandre.gigleux] I agree that we should detect also deprecated function calls, however I would refrain for using them in compliant code example (to avoid anybody blaming us that we recommended deprecated crypto). Either we can use ``++openssl_encrypt++`` \http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-encrypt.php  , or drop compliant example completely
