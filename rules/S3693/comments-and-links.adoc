This rule has been deprecated for ``++C#++`` and ``++VB.NET++``, see details in https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues/2468[SonarSource/sonar-dotnet#2468] . Due to a bug in rule-api, sub-task deprecation does not work. We've decided to deprecated it at parent RSPEC level due to the fact that it was not implemented in ``{cpp}``.


The rule still makes sense for {cpp}, so a new RSPEC can be created for it once a decision is taken to implement it.
