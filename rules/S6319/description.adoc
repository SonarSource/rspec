Amazon SageMaker is a managed machine learning service. It allows to build and train machine learning models in a production-ready hosted environment. SageMaker contains notebook instances that are running the Jupyter Notebook App. Those instances can be encrypted to protect the machine learning storage volumes. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium they are not able to access the data.
