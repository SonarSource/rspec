Amazon SageMaker is a managed machine learning service in a hosted production-ready environment. To train machine learning models, SageMaker instances can process potentially sensitive data, such as personal information that should not be stored unencrypted. In the event that adversaries physically access the storage media, they cannot decrypt encrypted data.
