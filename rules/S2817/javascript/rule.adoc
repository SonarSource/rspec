The Web SQL Database standard never saw the light of day. It was first formulated, then deprecated by the W3C and was only implemented in some browsers. (It is not supported in Firefox or IE.)

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
var db = window.openDatabase("myDb", "1.0", "Personal secrets stored here", 2*1024*1024);  // Noncompliant
