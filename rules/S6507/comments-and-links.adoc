Rule derived from the C# version of S2445, due to this branch of the rule generating a lot of FPs. 

Valid scenarios using local variables include retrieval of the object being locked from a collection or complex logic, to support a fine graned synchronization, renaming of a readonly field in the context of the current method or locking inside a loop, on the iteration variable.

The rule still makes sense, however, for all scenarios which don't require advanced synchronization, and prevents synchronization issues captured by S2445 to be circumvented via a local variable. For example via `var local = new object(); lock (local) { ... }`.
