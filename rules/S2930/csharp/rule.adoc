== Why is this an issue?

When writing managed code, you don't need to worry about allocating or freeing memory: The garbage collector takes care of it. For efficiency reasons, some objects such as ``++Bitmap++`` use unmanaged memory, enabling for example the use of pointer arithmetic. Such objects have potentially huge unmanaged memory footprints, but will have tiny managed ones. Unfortunately, the garbage collector only sees the tiny managed footprint, and fails to reclaim the unmanaged memory (by calling ``++Bitmap++``'s finalizer method) in a timely fashion. 


Moreover, memory is not the only system resource which needs to be managed in a timely fashion: The operating system can only handle having so many file descriptors (e.g. ``++FileStream++``) or sockets (e.g. ``++WebClient++``) open at any given time. Therefore, it is important to ``++Dispose++`` of them as soon as they are no longer needed, rather than relying on the garbage collector to call these objects' finalizers at some nondeterministic point in the future.


This rule tracks ``private`` fields and local variables of the following ``IDisposable`` / ``IAsyncDisposable`` types, which are never disposed, closed, aliased, returned, or passed to other methods.


* ``++System.IO++`` namespace
** ``++System.IO.FileStream++``
** ``++System.IO.StreamReader++``
** ``++System.IO.StreamWriter++``

* ``++System.Net++`` namespace
** ``++System.Net.WebClient++``

* ``++System.Net.Sockets++`` namespace
** ``++System.Net.Sockets.Socket++``
** ``++System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient++``
** ``++System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient++``

* ``++System.Drawing++`` namespace
** ``++System.Drawing.Image++``
** ``++System.Drawing.Bitmap++``

which are either instantiated directly using the ``++new++`` operator, or using one of the following factory methods:


* ``++System.IO.File.Create()++``
* ``++System.IO.File.Open()++``
* ``++System.Drawing.Image.FromFile()++``
* ``++System.Drawing.Image.FromStream()++``

on both private fields and local variables.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class ResourceHolder 
{
  private FileStream fs; // Noncompliant; Dispose or Close are never called

  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }

  public void WriteToFile(string path, string text)
  {
    var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open); // Noncompliant
    var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text);
    fs.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable, IAsyncDisposable
{
  private FileStream fs;

  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }

  public void Dispose() 
  {
    this.fs.Dispose();
  }

  public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
  {
    await fs.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
  }

  public void WriteToFile(string path, string text)
  {
    using (var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
    {
      var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text);
      fs.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
    }
  }
}
----


=== Exceptions

``IDisposable`` / ``IAsyncDisposable`` variables returned from a method or passed to other methods are ignored, as are local ``IDisposable`` / ``IAsyncDisposable`` objects that are initialized with other ``IDisposable`` / ``IAsyncDisposable`` objects.

[source,csharp]
----
public Stream WriteToFile(string path, string text)
{
  var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open); // Compliant, because it is returned
  var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text);
  fs.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
  return fs;
}

public void ReadFromStream(Stream s)
{
  var sr = new StreamReader(s); // Compliant as it would close the underlying stream.
  // ...
}

\[~tamas.vajk] if this rule comes from R#, please provide the R# rule key.

Also, there is the question of classes that ``++Dispose++`` of their ``++IDisposable++`` members, but not from their own ``++Dispose++`` methods. I.e. they call ``++Dispose++`` from some other, randomly-named method. Does this case merit coverage under this rule? A separate rule?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I think the separate rule for "implementing IDisposable" (\http://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-2931) is a good idea. Let's keep it this way, we'll see if it generates loads of duplicate issues or not.


This rule is not in Resharper.
