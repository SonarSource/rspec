== Why is this an issue?

Initializing an alphanumeric field with the literal character ``++' '++``, ``++'1'++``, or ``++'0'++`` has the same effect as using the equivalent figurative constant ``++*BLANK++``, ``++*ON++``, or ``++*OFF++``, but the constant version removes ambiguity and makes the code more readable.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,rpg]
----
C                   MOVE      ' '           FLD1
----

[source,rpg]
----
  /free
    fld1 = ' ';
  /end-free
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,rpg]
----
C                   MOVE      *BLANK        FLD1
----

[source,rpg]
----
  /free
    fld1 = *BLANK;
  /end-free
