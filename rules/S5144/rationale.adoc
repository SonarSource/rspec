Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when attackers can coerce a server to
perform arbitrary requests on their behalf. +

An SSRF vulnerability can either be basic or blind, depending on whether the
server's fetched data is directly returned in the web application's response. +
The absence of the corresponding response for the coerced request on the
application is not a barrier to exploitation and thus must be treated in the
same way as basic SSRF.
