Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when attackers can coerce a server to
perform arbitrary requests on their behalf. +

A SSRF vulnerability can either be basic or blind depending on whether the
fetched data is directly returned in the web application's response. +

It is a common remote entry point for attackers on their victim's organization
infrastructure.
