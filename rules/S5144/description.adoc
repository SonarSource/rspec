User supplied data, such as URL parameters, POST data payloads, or cookies, should always be considered untrusted and tainted. Performing requests from user-controlled data could allow attackers to make arbitrary requests on the internal network or to change their original meaning and thus to retrieve or delete sensitive information. 


The problem could be mitigated in any of the following ways:

* Validate the user provided data, such as the URL and headers, used to construct the request.
* Redesign the application to not send requests based on user provided data.
