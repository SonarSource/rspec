==== Blacklist TOCTOU

When employing a blacklist to mitigate SSRF attacks, it is essential to guard against Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities in the validation logic.

A common example of a TOCTOU vulnerability occurs when the domain name is resolved to an IP address for blacklist validation, but the hostname is resolved again later by the request library to make the actual request. An attacker could exploit DNS rebinding to change the IP address between these two resolutions and bypass the blacklist.


To prevent this, ensure that the domain name is resolved to an IP address only once, and this IP address is used consistently throughout the validation and request process.
