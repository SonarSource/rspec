Untrusted data, such as GET or POST request content, should always be
considered tainted. An application should avoid performing server-side requests
based on taintable data.

When such a feature is strictly necessary, SSRF could be mitigated by applying
an allow-list of trustable domains or by providing an API which indexes the
allowed domains, example *http://example.com?url=1*.
