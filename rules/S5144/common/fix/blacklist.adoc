==== Blacklisting

While whitelisting URLs is the preferred approach to ensure only safe URLs are accessible, there are scenarios where blacklisting may be necessary.

If whitelisting is not feasible, blacklisting can serve as a partial defense against SSRF attacks, particularly when the objective is to block access to internal resources or specific known malicious URLs.

When implementing blacklisting, it is crucial to:

* Comprehensively Check URLs: Ensure that the URL scheme, domain, and path are all scrutinized. This prevents attackers from circumventing the blacklist by altering schemes or paths.
* Understand Limitations: Recognize that blacklisting is not a foolproof solution. It should be part of a multi-layered security strategy to effectively mitigate SSRF risks.

By adhering to these guidelines, blacklisting can be a useful, albeit secondary, measure in protecting against SSRF attacks.
