==== Pre-Approved URLs

Create a list of authorized and secure URLs that you want the application
to be able to request. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.

*Important note*: The application must do validation on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
