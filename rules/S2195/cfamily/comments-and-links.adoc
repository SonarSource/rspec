I would:

So I would rather rephrase this to something like this:

Preprocessors macros can be defined in the code using the ``++#define++`` directive, or supplied to the compiler at compile time (i.e. on the command line or as part of the project's configuration). Either is acceptable, but redefining in the code a macro that was provided at compile time indicates a problem. At best, the redefinition is redundant and the build could be simplified by its removal. At worst, it conflicts with or contradicts the original supplied value potentially causing unexpected results and making debugging very difficult.
