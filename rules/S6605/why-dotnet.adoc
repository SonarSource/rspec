== Why is this an issue?

Both the `List.Exists` method and `IEnumerable.Any` method can be used to find the first element that satisfies a predicate in a collection. However, `List.Exists` can be faster than `IEnumerable.Any` for `List` objects, as well as require significantly less memory. For small collections, the performance difference may be negligible, but for large collections, it can make a noticeable difference. The same applies for `ImmutableList` and arrays too.
