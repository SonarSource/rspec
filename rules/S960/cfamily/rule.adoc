== Why is this an issue?

It is tempting to treat function-like macros as functions, but the two things work differently. For instance, the use of functions offers parameter type-checking, while the use of macros does not. Additionally, with macros, there is the potential for a macro to be evaluated multiple times. In general, functions offer a safer, more robust mechanism than function-like macros, and that safety usually outweighs the speed advantages offered by macros. Therefore functions should be used instead when possible.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#define CUBE (X) ((X) * (X) * (X)) // Noncompliant

void func(void) {
  int i = 2;
  int a = CUBE(++i); // Noncompliant. Expands to: int a = ((++i) * (++i) * (++i))
  // ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
inline int cube(int i) { 
  return i * i * i;
}

void func(void) {
  int i = 2;
  int a = cube(++i); // yields 27
  // ...
}
----

@Ann, I would append the following MISRA explanations to the description :

While macros can provide a speed advantage over functions, functions provide a safer and more robust mechanism. This is particularly true with respect to the type checking of parameters, and the problem of function-like macros potentially evaluating parameters multiple times.
