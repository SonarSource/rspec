== Why is this an issue?

Even if function-like macros may look similar to functions, they work differently. For example, functions provide parameter type-checking, whereas macros do not. Furthermore, since macros result in textual replacements, the code within a macro argument may be evaluated multiple times or in unexpected ways.

Generally, functions provide a more secure and reliable mechanism than function-like macros. This safety usually outweighs the speed advantages allegedly offered by macros. Therefore, whenever possible, functions should be preferred.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#define CUBE (X) ((X) * (X) * (X)) // Noncompliant

void func(void) {
  int i = 2;
  int a = CUBE(++i); // Noncompliant. Expands to: int a = ((++i) * (++i) * (++i))
  // ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
inline int cube(int i) { 
  return i * i * i;
}

void func(void) {
  int i = 2;
  int a = cube(++i); // yields 27
  // ...
}
----

=== Exceptions

In a few situations, actual functions can't replace function-like macros because the macro relies on features that only work with textual replacement. For instance:

* Using manipulation of tokens, such as ``++##++`` (token-pasting) and `#` (stringification).
* Getting information about the context into which the macro is expanded by using ``++__FILE__++``, ``++__LINE__++``, ``++__func__++``, or other similar compiler-specific constructs.
+
Note that {cpp}20 `std::source_location` can be a good replacement for some of these use cases -- see S6190.


This rule will ignore macros that make use of those features.

While macros can provide a speed advantage over functions, functions provide a safer and more robust mechanism. This is particularly true with respect to the type checking of parameters, and the problem of function-like macros potentially evaluating parameters multiple times.
