ActiveMQ can send/receive JMS Object messages (named ObjectMessage in ActiveMQ context) to comply with JMS specification. Internally, ActiveMQ relies on Java serialization mechanism for marshaling/unmarshaling of the message payload. Deserialization based on data supplied by the user could lead to remote code execution attacks, where the structure of the serialized data is changed to modify the behavior of the object being unserialized.


To limit the risk to be victim of such attack, ActiveMQ 5.12.2+ enforces developers to explicitly whitelist packages that can be exchanged using ObjectMessages.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
factory.setTrustAllPackages(true); // Noncompliant

ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
// no call to factory.setTrustedPackages(...);
----


== Compliant Solution

----
ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
factory.setTrustedPackages(Arrays.asList("org.mypackage1", "org.mypackage2"));
----
