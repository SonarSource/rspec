ActiveMQ can send/receive JMS Object messages (ObjectMessage in ActiveMQ
context) to comply with JMS specifications. Internally, ActiveMQ relies on
Java's serialization mechanism for the marshaling and unmarshalling of the
messages' payload.

Applications should restrict the types that can be unserialized from JMS
messages.

== Why is this an issue?

When the application does not implement controls over the JMS object types, its
clients could be able to force the deserialization of arbitrary objects. This
may lead to deserialization injection attacks.

=== What is the potential impact?

Attackers will be able to force the deserialization of arbitrary objects. This
process will trigger the execution of magic unmarshalling methods on the object
and its properties. With a specially crafted serialized object, the attackers
can exploit those magic methods to achieve malicious purposes.

While the exact impact depends on the types available in the execution context
at the time of deserialization, such an attack can generally lead to the
execution of arbitrary code on the application server.

==== Application-specific attacks

By exploiting the behavior of some of the application-defined types and objects,
the attacker could manage to affect the application's business logic. The exact
consequences will depend on the application's nature:

* Payment bypass in an e-commerce application.
* Privilege escalation.
* Unauthorized users' data access.

==== Publicly-known exploitation

In some cases, depending on the library the application uses and their versions,
there may exist publicly known deserialization attack payloads known as *gadget
chains*. In general, they are designed to have severe consequences, such as:

* Arbitrary code execution
* Arbitrary file read or write
* Server-side request forgery

Those attacks are independent of the application's own logic and from the types
it specifies.

== How to fix it in Java EE

=== Code examples

The following code example is vulnerable to a deserialization injection attack
because it allows the deserialization of arbitrary types from JMS messages.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
factory.setTrustAllPackages(true); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
factory.setTrustedPackages(Arrays.asList("org.mypackage1", "org.mypackage2"));
----

=== How does this work?

The noncompliant code example calls the `setTrustAllPackages` method that
explicitly allows the deserialization of arbitrary types. On the contrary, the
compliant code example, thanks to the `setTrustedPackages` method, defines a
short list of classes allowed for the deserialization.

While defining a short list of trusted types is generally the state-of-the-art
solution to avoid deserialization injection attacks, it is important to ensure
that the allowed classes and packages can not be used to exploit the issue. In
that case, a vulnerability would still be present.

Note that ActiveMQ, starting with version 5.12.2, forces developers to
explicitly list packages that JMS messages can contain. This limits the risk of
successful exploitation. In versions before that one, calling the
`ActiveMQConnectionFactory` constructor without further configuration would
leave the application at risk.
