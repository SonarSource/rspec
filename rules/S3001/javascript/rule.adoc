== Why is this an issue?

The semantics of the ``++delete++`` operator are a bit tricky, and it can only be reliably used to remove properties from objects. Pass anything else to it, and you may or may not get the desired result.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
var x  = 1;
delete x;       // Noncompliant

function foo(){
..
}

delete foo;  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
var obj = {
  x:1,
  foo: function(){
  ...
  }
};
delete obj.x;
delete obj.foo;
----
