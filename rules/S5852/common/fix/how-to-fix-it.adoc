The performance impacts created by backtracking can be reduced by decreasing the number of possible paths that the engine can take.

* Use possessive quantifiers and atomic groups to prevent reevaluation of sections of input.
* Refactor nested quantifiers to limit the number of ways that the inner group can be matched by the outer quantifier.
* Use negated character classes instead of `.` to avoid matching delimiter characters in delimited strings.
* Where possible, use quantifiers that limit the maximum number of matches.
