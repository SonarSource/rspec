Regular expression engines use a technique called *backtracking* as part of evaluating an input. If the engine finds an evaluation path that doesn't match, it will undo (backtrack) the most recent matches until it finds another path it can try. It will continue trying all possible paths in the hope of finding a match.

Certain expressions can have *super-linear complexity*, where backtracking causes longer inputs to produce a proportionally large increase in running time. With a sufficiently long input, the running time can increase to the point where it results in a denial of service in the application.

In extremely bad cases, the running time increases exponentially compared to the input length. This is known as *catastrophic backtracking* and even small inputs, less than 50 characters in length, can result in a denial of service.

This rule determines the runtime complexity of a regular expression and informs you if it is not linear.
