The result of the comparison is the same, regardless of whether the constant is on the left or right-hand side. But following this convention will help pinpoint the occasional error where ``++=++`` (assignment) is substituted for ``++==++`` (comparison). 


If the constant is on the right-hand side of the expression in such cases, the code will still compile and run - just not as expected. If the constant is on the left-hand side, the error will be caught at the first attempt to compile.
