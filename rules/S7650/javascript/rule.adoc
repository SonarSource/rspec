This rule raises an issue when the `inputs` metadata property is used in `@Component` or `@Directive` decorators.

== Why is this an issue?

Using the `inputs` metadata property in Angular components and directives goes against the Angular Style Guide recommendations. This approach has several drawbacks:

* **Reduced readability**: The `inputs` array separates the input declaration from the actual property definition, making the code harder to follow.
* **Limited type safety**: When inputs are defined in the metadata array, TypeScript cannot provide proper type checking and IntelliSense support.
* **Maintenance complexity**: Developers need to look in two places (the metadata and the class properties) to understand the component's inputs.
* **Inconsistent patterns**: Mixing metadata-based and decorator-based input definitions creates inconsistency in the codebase.

The Angular Style Guide specifically recommends using the `@Input()` decorator directly on class properties instead of the `inputs` metadata property. This approach provides better developer experience, clearer code structure, and improved tooling support.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using the `inputs` metadata property reduces code maintainability and developer productivity. It makes the codebase harder to understand and maintain, especially for teams working on large Angular applications. The lack of proper type checking can also lead to runtime errors that could have been caught at compile time.

=== How to fix in Angular?

Replace the `inputs` metadata property with `@Input()` decorators on the corresponding class properties. This provides better type safety and follows Angular best practices.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  inputs: ['name', 'age: userAge'], // Noncompliant
  template: '<div>{{name}} is {{age}} years old</div>'
})
class UserComponent {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  template: '<div>{{name}} is {{age}} years old</div>'
})
class UserComponent {
  @Input() name: string;
  @Input('userAge') age: number;
}
----

For directives, the same principle applies. Remove the `inputs` metadata and use `@Input()` decorators instead.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]',
  inputs: ['color', 'highlightColor'] // Noncompliant
})
class HighlightDirective {
  color: string;
  highlightColor: string;
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
class HighlightDirective {
  @Input() color: string;
  @Input() highlightColor: string;
}
----
