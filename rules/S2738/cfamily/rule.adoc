== Noncompliant Code Example

----
try {
  file.open("test.txt");
} catch (...) {  // Noncompliant
  // ...
}

== Compliant Solution

----
try {
  file.open("test.txt");
} catch (std::ifstream::failure e) {
  // ...
}

== Exceptions

There are cases though where you want to catch all exceptions, because no exceptions should be allowed to escape the function, and generic ``++catch++`` handlers are excluded from the rule:

* In the main function
* In a ``++noexcept++`` function
* In an ``++extern "C"++`` function

Additionally, if the ``++catch++`` handler is throwing an exception (either the same as before, with ``++throw;++`` or a new one that may make more sense to the callers of the function), or is never exiting (because it calls a ``++noreturn++`` function, for instance ``++exit++``), then the accurate type of the exception usually does not matter any longer: this case is excluded too.
