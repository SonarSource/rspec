== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

=== Disable JavaScript

If it is possible to disable JavaScript in the WebView, this is the most secure option. 

When using the https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter` package] v4 and above, by default 
JavaScript is disabled in every https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/latest/webview_flutter/WebViewController-class.html[`WebViewController`]
instance. Therefore, https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/latest/webview_flutter/WebViewController/setJavaScriptMode.html[`setJavaScriptMode`]
does not need to be explicitly called with https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/latest/webview_flutter/JavaScriptMode.html[`JavaScriptMode.disabled`]. 

The same applies to https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/3.0.4/webview_flutter/WebView-class.html[`WebView`] 
instances in https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter` package] v3 and below: there is no
need to explicitly set the named constructor parameter `javascriptMode` to https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/3.0.4/webview_flutter/JavascriptMode.html[`JavascriptMode.disabled`].

When using the https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview[`flutter_inappwebview` package], on the other hand,
the default behavior is to enable JavaScript. Therefore, it is necessary to set the `enableJavaScript` parameter
to `false` in https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_inappwebview/latest/flutter_inappwebview/InAppWebViewSettings-class.html[InAppWebViewSettings] 
and https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_inappwebview/latest/flutter_inappwebview/InAppWebViewOptions-class.html[InAppWebViewOptions] 
instances.

Of course, sometimes it is necessary to enable, or keep enabled, JavaScript, in which case the following 
recommendations should be considered.

=== Remove JavaScript interface when loading untrusted content

JavaScript interfaces can be removed at a later point. It is recommended to remove the JavaScript
interface when it is no longer needed. If it is needed for a longer time, consider removing it before
loading untrusted content. This can be done by calling `webViewController.removeJavaScriptChannel('channelName')` for the https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter` package] or `webViewController.removeJavaScriptHandler('channelName')` for the https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview[`flutter_inappwebview` package].

A good place to do this in Flutter is inside navigation callbacks like https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/latest/webview_flutter/NavigationDelegate/onNavigationRequest.html[`NavigationDelegate.onNavigationRequest`] 
for the https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter` package] or https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_inappwebview/latest/flutter_inappwebview/PlatformInAppBrowserEvents/shouldOverrideUrlLoading.html[`WebViewClient.shouldOverrideUrlLoading`] 
for the https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview[`flutter_inappwebview` package] package, where you can check the URL being loaded and remove the JavaScript channel 
if the content is untrusted.

=== Alternative methods to implement native bridges

If a native channel has to be added to the web view or its controller, and it is impossible to remove it 
at a later point, consider using an alternative method that offers more control over the communication flow.

For the `webview_flutter` package, there is currently no way to know the origin of an incoming JavaScript message. Therefore using JavaScript communication with `webview_flutter` is discouraged.

For the `flutter_inappwebview` package, use https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_inappwebview/latest/flutter_inappwebview/WebMessageListener-class.html[`WebMessageListener`] which allows you to restrict the origins that can send messages to your application.

== Sensitive Code Example

https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter`] 
[source,dart]
----
final _controller = WebViewController()
    ..setJavaScriptMode(JavaScriptMode.unrestricted)
    ..addJavaScriptChannel("channel", onMessageReceived: (m) {}); // Sensitive
----

https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview[`flutter_inappwebview`]
[source,dart]
----
InAppWebView(
  onWebViewCreated: (controller) {
    controller?.addJavaScriptHandler( // Sensitive
      handlerName: "channel",
      callback: (args) {}
    );
  },
);
----

== Compliant Solution

The most secure option is to not enable, or disable, JavaScript entirely. S6362 further explains why it should not 
be enabled unless absolutely necessary.

https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter`] 
[source,dart]
----
final _controller = WebViewController();
----

If possible, remove the JavaScript channel after it is no longer needed, or before loading any untrusted content.

https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter[`webview_flutter`] 
[source,dart]
----
_controller.removeJavaScriptChannel("channel");
----

https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview[`flutter_inappwebview`]
[source,dart]
----
_controller.removeJavaScriptHandler("channel");
----

If a JavaScript channel must be used, consider using `flutter_inappwebview` instead of `webview_flutter`. The Web Message API allows you to restrict the origins that can send messages to the JavaScript bridge.

[source,dart]
----
InAppWebView(
  onWebViewCreated: (controller) async {
    await inAppController.addWebMessageListener(
      WebMessageListener(
        jsObjectName: "channel",
          allowedOriginRules: {
            "https://secure-origin",
          }, // Restrict to specific origin
          onPostMessage: (message, origin, isMainFrame, replyProxy) {},
        ),
      );
  },
);
