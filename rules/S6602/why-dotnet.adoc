== Why is this an issue?

Both the `List.Find` method and `Enumerable.FirstOrDefault` method can be used to find the first element that satisfies a given condition in a collection. However, `List.Find` can be faster than `Enumerable.FirstOrDefault` for `List` objects. For small collections, the performance difference may be minor, but for large collections, it can make a noticeable difference. The same applies for `ImmutableList` and arrays too.

This rule should be activated with care. The performance results vary a lot for different runtimes. Especially the https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-9/#collections[performance improvments in .Net 9] bring `FirstOrDefault` on par with the collection specific `Find`methods in most cases.
