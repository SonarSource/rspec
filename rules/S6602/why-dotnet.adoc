== Why is this an issue?

Both the `List.Find` method and `IEnumerable.FirstOrDefault` method can be used to find the first element that satisfies a given condition in a collection. However, `List.Find` can be faster than `IEnumerable.FirstOrDefault` for `List` objects. For small collections, the performance difference may be minor, but for large collections, it can make a noticeable difference. The same applies for `ImmutableList` and arrays too.
