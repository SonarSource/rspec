== Why is this an issue?

The ``++%s++`` placeholder is used to read a word into a string.

By default, there is no restriction on the length of that word, and the developer is required to pass a sufficiently large buffer for storing it.

No matter how large the buffer is, there will always be a longer word.

Therefore, programs relying on ``++%s++`` are vulnerable to buffer overflows.


A field width specifier can be used together with the ``++%s++`` placeholder to limit the number of bytes which will by written to the buffer.

Note that an additional byte is required to store the null terminator.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%s", buffer);      // Noncompliant - will overflow when a word longer than 9 characters is entered
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%9s", buffer);     // Compliant - will not overflow
----

perhaps we should also cover sscanf() and fscanf()

Let's exclude sscanf() because the length of the string is known by the program, and is an upper bound for the size of the buffer required by %s.
