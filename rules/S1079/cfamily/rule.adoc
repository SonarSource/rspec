== Why is this an issue?

The ``++%s++`` placeholder is used to read a word into a string.

By default, there is no restriction on the length of that word, and the developer is required to pass a sufficiently large buffer for storing it.

No matter how large the buffer is, there will always be a longer word.

Therefore, programs relying on ``++%s++`` are vulnerable to buffer overflows.


A field width specifier can be used together with the ``++%s++`` placeholder to limit the number of bytes which will by written to the buffer.

Note that an additional byte is required to store the null terminator.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%s", buffer);      // Noncompliant - will overflow when a word longer than 9 characters is entered
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%9s", buffer);     // Compliant - will not overflow
----
