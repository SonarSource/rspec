The ``++%s++`` format specifier is used to read a string into a buffer. If the input string exceeds the size of this buffer, a buffer overflow can occur.

== Why is this an issue?

By default, there is no limit on the length of the string being read. The ``scanf`` family of functions will continue to read characters into the buffer until they encounter a whitespace character.

If the input contains a string that is long enough and lacks whitespace characters, it can result in memory beyond the end of the buffer being overwritten. This situation is known as a buffer overflow vulnerability.

=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite memory used by the application. This could result in the modification of application data, unexpected behavior, or even cause the application to become unstable or crash. In some cases, the attacker might also gain control over the execution flow of the application, leading to arbitrary code execution.

== How to fix it

A field width can be used together with the ``++%s++`` format specifier. This places an upper limit on the number of characters that will be read into the buffer.

Note that the ``++%s++`` format specifier always null-terminates the string in the buffer. You will need to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the required input and the null terminator.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%s", buffer);  // Noncompliant
----

If this code is given the word ``noncompliant`` as an input, ``noncomplia`` will be stored in ``buffer`` and ``nt␀`` will overwrite the contents of the memory immediately following ``buffer``.

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%9s", buffer);
----

If this code is given the word ``noncompliant`` as an input, ``noncompli␀`` will be stored in ``buffer``.

perhaps we should also cover sscanf() and fscanf()

Let's exclude sscanf() because the length of the string is known by the program, and is an upper bound for the size of the buffer required by %s.
