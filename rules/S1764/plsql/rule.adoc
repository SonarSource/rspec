== Why is this an issue?

Using the same value on either side of a binary operator is almost always a mistake. In the case of logical operators, it is either a copy/paste error and therefore a bug, or it is simply wasted code, and should be simplified.


This rule ignores operators ``+``, ``++*++`` and ``++||++``, and expressions: ``++1=1++``, ``++1<>1++``, ``++1!=1++``, ``++1~=1++`` and ``++1^=1++``.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
SELECT code
  FROM Person
  WHERE first_name IS NULL OR first_name IS NULL; -- Noncompliant

SELECT * FROM Users
  INNER JOIN Clients ON Clients.id = Clients.id; -- Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
SELECT code
  FROM Person
  WHERE first_name IS NULL OR last_name IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM Users
  INNER JOIN Clients ON Clients.id = Users.id;
