In C, >=1 evaluates to true & 0 evaluates to false. Is it that the same holds true in Java but it's just considered very bad form? If so, then why eliminate this one:

----
if (5 - 5) { // always 0
  do_u();
}

?


Also, we have a different rule that yells at people for using equality operators with floating-point numbers, so the first exception is doubly confusing
