\[~ann.campbell.2] I'm wondering why not marked with tag "bug" ? in some cases this can be a copy-paste of a complex expression leading to surprising results.

\[~linda.martin] I'm confused: it looks like the JavaScript subtask is a copy of the Java subtask. There's no description text in the JavaScript subtask, but there is an Exceptions section which... is fully appropriate for JavaScript?

Hi, not sure whether it's the right place to report this.


I got a false positive in this {cpp} code fragment with the "<<" operator (bitwise shift)


enum Context

{

   CREATE_STANDALONE_P = (1 << 0),

   MODIFY_STANDALONE_P = (1 << 1),


Identical sub-expressions on both sides of operator "<<"


Cheers
