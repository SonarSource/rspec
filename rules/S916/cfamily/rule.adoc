A switch-label can be placed anywhere within the statements that form the body of a switch statement, potentially leading to unstructured code. To prevent this from happening, the scope of a case-label or default-label shall be the statement forming the body of a switch statement. All case-clauses and the default-clause shall be at the same scope.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
switch (x) {
  case 1: // Compliant
    if (foo) {
      case 2: // Noncompliant
        break;
      default: // Noncompliant
        break;
    }
    break;
  default: // Compliant
    break;
}
----
