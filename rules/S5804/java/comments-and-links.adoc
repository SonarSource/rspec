In the future this rule can be improved:

* to check if the message sent to the user related to UsernameNotFoundException doesn't disclose any information about the existence of the user:

----
try {    
   userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);    
} catch (UsernameNotFoundException e) {    
   response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, e.getMessage());    
   return;    
}

* to check if the message sent to the user related to UsernameNotFoundException is the same than when the password is not good:

----
if (user == null) {
      throw new UsernameNotFoundException("Bad username");
}
if (!user.isPasswordCorrect(password)) {
      throw new BadCredentialsException("Bad credentials");
}

* Some https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-custom-authentication-failure-handler[authentificationfailurehandler] like https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.15.RELEASE/apidocs/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/ExceptionMappingAuthenticationFailureHandler.html[ExceptionMappingAuthenticationFailureHandler] seems to https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/?code=helloworldtang%2Fspring-boot-cookbook%2Fspring-boot-cookbook-master%2Fapp%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Ftangcheng%2Fapp%2Fapi%2Frest%2Fconfig%2FSecurityConfig.java[forward] the user to a page different based on exceptions and so disclose users existence.

I added again the case to raise when _UsernameNotFoundException_ is thrown because it causes an unnecessary  risk, there are several compliant solutions:

* using the same error message among all other exceptions
* using _UsernameNotFoundException_ but hiding it (_setHideUserNotFoundExceptions_ to false, so if spring allows us to hide these exceptions it is likely because they might be dangerous)
* not using _UsernameNotFoundException_ at all

_UsernameNotFoundException_ can be used not only in the authenticate part of a spring application, but in other features, like reset password, in this case only one exception will be likely raised and it should not be _UsernameNotFoundException_ (if the user uses it it is likely to disclose user existence):


----
public String reset_password(String username) throws AuthenticationException {
  Details user = null;
  try {
    user = loadUserByUsername(username);
  } catch (UsernameNotFoundException | DataAccessException e) {
    thrown UsernameNotFoundException("username not found");
  }
}
