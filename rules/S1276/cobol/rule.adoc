Using the ``++CORRESPONDING++`` option in ``++MOVE++``, ``++ADD++``, and ``++SUBTRACT++`` statements may seem like a good way of sparing source code because this single statement will represent several actual statements. However, it can lead to unexpected behavior due to the fact that fields might not be named the same, or might be named the same but not have the same data type.


It is therefore recommended to explicitly name the fields when using ``++ADD++``, ``++SUBTRACT++``, and ``++MOVE++`` statements.
