This rule raises an issue when environment variables are accessed directly using `ENV["KEY"]` without validation or default values, particularly in configuration contexts.

== Why is this an issue?

Environment variables are external dependencies that may not be set in all environments. When you access an environment variable using `ENV["KEY"]`, Ruby returns `nil` if the variable is not defined.

This can lead to several problems:

* *Application startup failures*: If critical configuration values are missing, your application may fail to start or behave unexpectedly.
* *Runtime errors*: Methods that expect strings or other specific types may crash when receiving `nil` values.
* *Silent failures*: Some APIs accept `nil` values but behave differently, leading to hard-to-debug issues.
* *Security vulnerabilities*: Missing security-related configuration (like API keys or secrets) might cause authentication to fail silently or use insecure defaults.

This is especially problematic in production environments where environment variables are the primary way to configure applications securely. A missing environment variable can cause immediate outages or security issues.

=== What is the potential impact?

Missing environment variables can cause application startup failures, runtime crashes, or security vulnerabilities. In production, this can lead to service outages or compromised authentication systems.

== How to fix it

Use the `||` operator to provide default values for non-critical environment variables.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
# Direct access without validation
api_timeout = ENV["API_TIMEOUT"] # Noncompliant
SomeService.configure(timeout: api_timeout)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
# Provide a sensible default value
api_timeout = ENV["API_TIMEOUT"] || "30"
SomeService.configure(timeout: api_timeout.to_i)
----
