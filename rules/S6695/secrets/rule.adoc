=== What is the potential impact?

WeChat application keys are used for authentication and authorization purposes
when integrating third-party applications with the WeChat platform. 

If a WeChat app key were to leak to an unintended audience, it could have severe
consequences for both the app developer and the app users.

==== WeChat exploitation

Furthermore, the leaked app key could enable unauthorized parties to manipulate
or disrupt the functionality of the WeChat app. They could tamper with app
settings, inject malicious code, or even take control of the app's user base.
Such actions could result in a loss of user trust, service disruptions, and
reputational damage for both the app developer and the WeChat platform.
