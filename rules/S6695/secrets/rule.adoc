==== WeChat exploitation

Furthermore, the leaked app key could enable unauthorized parties to manipulate
or disrupt the functionality of the WeChat app. They could tamper with app
settings, inject malicious code, or even take control of the app's user base.
Such actions could result in a loss of user trust, service disruptions, and
reputational damage for both the app developer and the WeChat platform.
