== Why is this an issue?

There's no valid reason to test ``++this++`` with ``++is++``. The only plausible explanation for such a test is that you're executing code in a parent class conditionally based on the kind of child class ``++this++`` is. But code that's specific to a child class should be _in_ that child class, not in the parent.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class JunkFood
{
  public void DoSomething() 
  {
    if (this is Pizza) // Noncompliant 
    {
      // ...
    } else if (...
  }
}
