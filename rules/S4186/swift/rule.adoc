Adding ``++IBInspectable++`` to a properly-typed variable makes it available in Xcode's Interface Builder. But that only works if variable type is declared explicitly as one of the following: 


* ``++Int++`` types, ``++Double++``, ``++Float++``, ``++Bool++``
* ``++String++`` (or its optional)
* ``++CGFloat++``, ``++CGPoint++``, ``++CGSize++``, ``++CGRect++``
* ``++UIColor++``, ``++UIImage++`` (and their optionals)
* ``++NSString++``,  ``++NSColor++``, ``++NSImage++`` (and their optionals)
* ``++NSRect++``, ``++NSPoint++``, ``++NSSize++``, 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
@IBInspectable  // Noncompliant; type is implicit
public var cornerRadius = 2.0 {
  didSet {
     //...
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
@IBInspectable
public var cornerRadius: CGFloat  = 2.0 {
  didSet {
     //...
  }
}
