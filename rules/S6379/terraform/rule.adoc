Enabling Azure resource-specific admin accounts can reduce an organization's ability to protect itself against account or service account thefts.

Full Administrator permissions fail to correctly separate duties and create potentially critical attack vectors on the impacted resources.

In case of abuse of elevated permissions, both the data on which impacted resources operate and their access traceability are at risk.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* This Azure resource is essential for the information system infrastructure.
* This Azure resource is essential for mission-critical functions.
* Compliance policies require this resource to disable its administrative accounts or permissions.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Disable the administrative accounts or permissions in this Azure resource.

== Sensitive Code Example

For https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/nodes-and-pools#pools[Azure Batch Pools]:

----
resource "azurerm_batch_pool" "example" {
  name = "sensitive"

  start_task {
    command_line = "echo 'Hello World'"
    max_task_retry_count = 1
    wait_for_success = true

    user_identity {
      auto_user {
        elevation_level = "Admin" # Sensitive
        scope = "Task"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/[Azure Container Registries]:

----
resource "azurerm_container_registry" "example" {
  name = "example"
  admin_enabled = true # Sensitive
}
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/nodes-and-pools#pools[Azure Batch Pools]:

----
resource "azurerm_batch_pool" "example" {
  name = "example"

  start_task {
    command_line = "echo 'Hello World'"
    max_task_retry_count = 1
    wait_for_success = true

    user_identity {
      auto_user {
        elevation_level = "NonAdmin"
        scope = "Task"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

For https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/[Azure Container Registries]:

----
resource "azurerm_container_registry" "exemple" {
  name = "example"
  admin_enabled = false
}
----

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

Make sure that enabling an administrative account or administrative permissions is safe here.

=== Highlighting

* For Azure Batch Pools, Highlight ``elevation_level = "Admin"``.
* For Azure container Registries, highlight ``admin_enabled = true`` or the resource.
