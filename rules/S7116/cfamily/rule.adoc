The first element of an array should be accessed using the subscript operator (`array[0]`),
instead of dereferencing the array (``++*array++``) or using the arrow operator on it (``++array->mem++``).

== Why is this an issue?

When an expression refers to an object of array type,
it can produce a pointer to the first element of the array. 
This behavior is known as array-to-pointer decay or simply array decay.

Because of array-to-pointer decay, it is possible to use the dereference operator (`*`) or
the pointer member access operator (``++->++``) on an array object to access its first element.
However, it remains unclear if accessing the first element was intentional.
In contrast, using array subscript (`[0]`) removes any such ambiguity.

This rule raises an issue when the deference operator or the member access operator is used
on an array.

[source,c]
----
struct Struct { int x; };
Struct elems[10];
int integers[5]; 

void init() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    *integers = i; // Noncompliant: "*" used to access "integers[0]"
  }
}

void process() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    elems->x *= 2; // Noncompliant: "->" used to access "elems[0]"
  }
}
----

== How to fix it

The fix depends on the intended effect of the code:

* If the intent is to access the first element, ``++->++`` or `*` should be replaced with an explicit subscripts with `[0]`;
* If another element was meant to be accessed, a subscript with the appropriate index should be used;
* If the intent was to dereference a pointer (for instance to iterate on array elements), the array should be replaced with the appropriate pointer.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct Struct { int x; };
Struct elems[10];

void process() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    elems->x *= 2; // Noncompliant: "->" used to access "elems[0]"
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

If the access to the first element was intentional, you can use subscript explicitly:
[source,cpp,,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct Struct { int x; };
Struct elems[10];

void process() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    elems[0].x *= 2; // Compliant: element accessed through subscript
  }
}
----

Otherwise, if ``++i++``th element was to be updated:
[source,cpp]
----
struct Struct { int x; };
Struct elems[10];

void process() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    elems[i].x *= 2; // Compliant: element accessed through subscript
  }
}
----

Finally, the ``++i++``th element can be accessed using ``++->++`` and `elem` pointer:
[source,cpp]
----
struct Struct { int x; };
Struct elems[10];

void process() {
  for (Struct* elem = elems, end = elems + 10; elem != end; ++elem) {
    elem->x *= 2; // Compliant: dereferencing a pointer
  }
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
int integers[5]; 

void init() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    *integers = i; // Noncompliant: "*" used to access "integers[0]"
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

The intent was probably to access the ``++i++``th element of `integers`:

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
int integers[5]; 

void init() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    integers[i] = i; // Compliant: element accessed through subscript
  }
}
----

Or, to preserve current behavior, use a subscript to explicitly access the first element:

[source,cpp]
----
int integers[5]; 

void init() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    integers[0] = i; // Compliant: element accessed through subscript
  }
}
----
