== Why is this an issue?

The Kotlin `when` statement is more powerful than the Java `switch` statement.
It can be used to compare a selector against a list of values and select from a list of more complex conditions.

This is a more readable and elegant alternative to a chain of `if` statements and should be used instead.

=== What is the potential impact?

==== Readability and Understanding

This change makes it easier to understand a function because it will reduce its complexity.
This is because a single `when` statement has less cognitive complexity than multiple `if` statements, even if it has as many cases.

== How to fix it

Refactor the chain of `if` statements into a list of conditions for a `when` statement.
Note that the order of the conditions must stay the same as in the `if` chain.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
fun compare(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    // ...
    return if (a > b) { // Noncompliant
        1
    } else if (a < b) {
        -1
    } else {
        0
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
fun compare(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    // ...
    return when { // Compliant
        a > b -> 1
        a < b -> -1
        else -> 0
    }
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,kotlin,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
fun chained(instance: Any) {
    if (instance is Foo) { // Noncompliant
        instance.fooFunction()
    } else if (instance is Bar) {
        instance.barFunction()
    } else if (instance is Boo) {
        instance.booFunction()
    } else {
        throw IllegalArgumentException()
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,kotlin,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
fun chained(instance: Any) {
    when (instance) { // Compliant
        is Foo -> instance.fooFunction()
        is Bar -> instance.barFunction()
        is Boo -> instance.booFunction()
        else -> throw IllegalArgumentException()
    }
}
