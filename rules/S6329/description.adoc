Enabling public network access to cloud resources can affect an organization's
ability to protect its data or internal operations from data theft or
disruption.

Depending on the component, inbound access from the Internet can be enabled
via:

* a boolean value that explicitly allows access to the public network.
* the assignment of a public IP address.
* database firewall rules that allow public IP ranges.

Deciding to allow public access may happen for various reasons such as for
quick maintenance, time saving, or by accident.

This decision increases the likelihood of attacks on the organization, such as:

* data breaches.
* intrusions into the infrastructure to permanently steal from it.
* and various malicious traffic, such as DDoS attacks.
