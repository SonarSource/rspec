Enabling public network access to cloud resources can affect an organization's
ability to protect its data or internal operations from data theft or
disruption.

Depending on the component, inbound access from the Internet can be enabled
via:

* A Boolean value that explicitly allows access to the public network.
* The assignment of a public IP address.
* Database firewall rules that allow the specification of public IP ranges.

Deciding to allow public access may happen for various reasons such as for
quick maintenance, time saving, or by accident.

This decision exposes the organisation to potential attacks that aim to:

* Breach data.
* Break into the infrastructure for permanent theft.
* And various malicious traffic, such as DDoS attacks.
