== Sensitive Code Example

DMS and EC2 instances have a public IP address assigned to them:

[source,yaml]
----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  DMSInstance:
    Type: AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance 
    Properties:
      PubliclyAccessible: true # sensitive, by default it's also set to true

  EC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance 
    Properties:
      NetworkInterfaces: 
        - AssociatePublicIpAddress: true # sensitive, by default it's also set to true
          DeviceIndex: "0"
----

== Compliant Solution

DMS and EC2 instances doesn't have a public IP address:

[source,yaml]
----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  DMSInstance:
    Type: AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance
    Properties:
      PubliclyAccessible: false

  EC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      NetworkInterfaces: 
        - AssociatePublicIpAddress: false
          DeviceIndex: "0"
