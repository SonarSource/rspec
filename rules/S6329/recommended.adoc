== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Avoid publishing cloud services on the Internet unless they are intended to be
publicly accessible, such as customer portals or e-commerce sites.

Use private networks (and associated private IP addresses) and VPC peering or
other secure communication tunnels to communicate with other cloud components.

The goal is to prevent the component from intercepting traffic coming in via
the public IP address.
If the cloud resource does not support the absence of a public IP address,
assign a public IP address to it, but do not create listeners for the public IP
address.
