Since {cpp}23, it's possible to refer to unicode characters by their unicode name, which describes the character. For example `\N{WHALE}` is equivalent to `\u{1F40B}` and will display the whale emoji ``pass:n[&#x1F40B;]``.

== Why is this an issue?

Most code maintainers do not know off the top of their heads what a Unicode hexadecimal code corresponds to. Using hexadecimal representation will put an additional burden on the maintenance, either to keep a comment or name in sync with the value to make the intent clear, or worse, by requiring everybody reading the code to search the corresponding code online.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// 1F40B corresponds to a whale
std::string logo = "\u{1F40B}"; // Noncompliant
----

The named escapes introduced by {cpp}23 allow to use either the Unicode name, or one of its aliases as listed in https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NameAliases.txt[NameAliases.txt]. It removes the maintenance burden by making the intent of the original code clear:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
std::string logo = "\N{WHALE}"; // Compliant
----
