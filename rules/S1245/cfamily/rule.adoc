== Why is this an issue?

----
int a;
class A
{
public:
  A();
private:
  int _b;
};

A::A()
{
  _b=a;  //Noncompliant
}
----

The order of initialization of static objects defined in different compilation units is not defined in the {cpp} language definition. Therefore, accessing global data from a constructor may result in reading from uninitialized objects
