== Why is this an issue?

To optimize the rendering of React list components, a unique identifier (UID) is required in the `key` attribute for each list item. This UID lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.  Using generated values like `Math.random()` or `Date.now()` is discouraged as their return value will differ between calls, causing the keys to not match up between renders, recreating the DOM. Also, this may cause bugs if values collide.

----
function Blog(props) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={Math.random()}> <!-- Noncompliant: Since the 'key' will be different on each render, React will update the DOM unnecessarily -->
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
----

To fix it, use a string or a number that uniquely identifies the list item. The key must be unique among its siblings, not globally.

If the data comes from a database, database IDs are already unique and are the best option. Otherwise, use a counter or a UUID generator.

Avoid using array indexes since, even if they are unique, the order of the elements may change.

          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
