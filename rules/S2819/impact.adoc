=== What is the potential impact?

The absence of origin verification during cross-origin communications can lead to serious security issues.

==== Data Breach

If an attacker can successfully exploit this vulnerability, they may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. For instance, a user's personal information, financial details, or other confidential data could be exposed. This not only compromises the user's privacy but can also lead to identity theft or financial loss.

==== Unauthorized Actions

An attacker could manipulate the communication between websites to perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge. This could range from making unauthorized purchases to changing user settings or even deleting accounts.
