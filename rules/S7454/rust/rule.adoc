== Why is this an issue?

Mistyped suffixes in numeric literals can lead to incorrect interpretations of the values intended by the developer. This is typically seen as a typo which could impact the functionality of the code. The rule does not however address integers that would not fit within the assumed type or specific valid groupings such as `_127` in decimal and octal numbers.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,rust,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let x = 2_32; // Noncompliant: Mistyped literal suffix
let y = 250_8; // Noncompliant: Mistyped literal suffix
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,rust,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let x = 2_i32; // Compliant: Correct literal suffix
let y = 250_u8; // Compliant: Correct literal suffix
----
