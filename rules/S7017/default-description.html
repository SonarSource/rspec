<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Azure Bot Framework secrets and tokens are two distinct pieces of information.<br>
They are both used to authenticate and authorize access to the Azure Bot
Framework, but they are different in nature.<br>
Both are used to authenticate and authorize access to the Azure Bot Framework,
but <strong>tokens</strong> are short-lived and generated by the Azure Bot Framework, by
using a <strong>secret</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Microsoft recommends using tokens instead of secrets because of their short
lifespan but note that using them will not completely prevent other developers
from embedding your bot in their websites. It just does make it difficult for
them to do so, and skilled people can still have the patience to make something
work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, we recommend not hardcoding secrets and tokens in your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting these secrets and tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bot_theft_or_impersonation">Bot theft or impersonation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attacker can use leaked Azure Bot Framework tokens and secrets to use your
bot for their own business purposes, leading to competition with your own bot
and potential financial or reputational damages to your organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_personal_data">Compromise of sensitive personal data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of service is often used to exchange information that could include
personal information, chat logs, and other private data that users have shared
on the platform. This is called Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
The leaked app key could provide a gateway for unauthorized individuals to
access and misuse this data, compromising the privacy and safety of the
application users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many industries and locations, there are legal and compliance requirements
to protect sensitive data. If this kind of sensitive personal data gets leaked,
companies face legal consequences, penalties, or violations of privacy laws.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application&#8217;s
users.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>

<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-webchat?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#production-embedding-option">Microsoft production embedding options</a>
to embed your bot in websites and follow the best practices to secure your bot
that Microsoft mentions in the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to make sure the code you embed in your user-facing front-end page
cannot be reused by other developers to embed your bot in their websites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using the "enhanced authentication" option, you can make sure the user ID on
messages from Direct Line to your bot will always be the same as the one you
initialized the Web Chat with and thus prevent other unwanted initiators.</p>
