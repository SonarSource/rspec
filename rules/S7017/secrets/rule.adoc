=== What is the potential impact?

Azure Bot Framework secrets and tokens are two distinct pieces of information. +
They are both used to authenticate and authorize access to the Azure Bot
Framework, but they are different in nature. +
Both are used to authenticate and authorize access to the Azure Bot Framework,
but **tokens** are short-lived and generated by the Azure Bot Framework, by
using a **secret**.

Microsoft recommends using tokens instead of secrets because of their short
lifespan but note that using them will not completely prevent other developers
from embedding your bot in their websites. It just does make it difficult for
them to do so, and skilled people can still have the patience to make something
work.

Generally, we recommend not hardcoding secrets and tokens in your code.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting these secrets and tokens.

==== Bot theft or impersonation

An attacker can use leaked Azure Bot Framework tokens and secrets to use your
bot for their own business purposes, leading to competition with your own bot
and potential financial or reputational damages to your organization.

== How to fix it

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/revoke.adoc[]

=== Use Azure DirectLine enhanced authentication

Use
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-webchat?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#production-embedding-option[Microsoft production embedding options]
to embed your bot in websites and follow the best practices to secure your bot
that Microsoft mentions in the
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#security-considerations[Direct Line API documentation].

The goal is to make sure the code you embed in your user-facing front-end page
cannot be reused by other developers to embed your bot in their websites.

By using the "enhanced authentication" option, you can make sure the user ID on
messages from Direct Line to your bot will always be the same as the one you
initialized the Web Chat with and thus prevent other unwanted initiators.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

The pages that contain the bot's secret or token are publicly accessible
mentionned by Microsoft should be avoided, **unless** you do not mind the risks
associated with hardcoding these secrets.
