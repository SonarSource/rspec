Open question: what is the best action to take? Is some sort of cast or conversion available or must the declaration be changed?


Also, it would be nice to have an understanding of _why_ it's inefficient.

\[~ann.campbell.2], Microfocus has some documentation on https://supportline.microfocus.com/documentation/books/sx51/prwrit.htm[Writing Efficient Programs].

The IBM COBOL Programming guide has a section on http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6SG3_6.1.0/com.ibm.cobol61.ent.doc/PGandLR/tasks/tpeff05a.html[Choosing efficient computational data items].


I think we should not activate this rule by default as the real performance impact may depend on the context.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] thanks for the references! I've expanded the description some based mostly on the Microfocus reference. I'm wondering how broadly it applies though. Specifically, do you think this bit applies beyond Microfocus:?

____
In native code programs, it is more efficient to move integer data items that are not COMP-X or COMP-5 to COMP-5 data items before doing arithmetic operations on them.

\[~ann.campbell.2], my understanding is that this always applies unless when compiling a program to https://supportline.microfocus.com/documentation/books/sx51/pracmp.htm["intermediate code"]. I think that "intermediate code" is specific to Microfocus because they target multiple operating systems.
