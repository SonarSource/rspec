This is an issue when `flask.send_file()` is called with a file-like object without providing either the `mimetype` or `attachment_filename` parameter.

== Why is this an issue?

Flask's `send_file()` function needs to determine the content type and filename for HTTP responses. When you pass a file path as a string, Flask can automatically detect these from the file system. However, when you pass a file-like object (such as an open file handle, `BytesIO`, or `StringIO`), Flask cannot determine this information automatically.

Without the `mimetype` parameter, Flask doesn't know what `Content-Type` header to set for the response. Without `attachment_filename`, Flask cannot set the `Content-Disposition` header properly for downloads.

When Flask encounters this situation, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that it cannot determine the content type. This causes your application to crash with a 500 Internal Server Error, creating a poor user experience.

=== What is the potential impact?

The application will crash with a `ValueError` when the endpoint is accessed, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error response. This breaks the file download functionality and creates a poor user experience.

== How to fix it in Flask

Add the `mimetype` parameter to specify the content type of the file being sent.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from flask import send_file

def download_file():
    file_obj = open('data.txt', 'rb')
    return send_file(file_obj)  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
from flask import send_file

def download_file():
    file_obj = open('data.txt', 'rb')
    return send_file(file_obj, mimetype='text/plain')
----

Add the `attachment_filename` parameter to specify the filename for downloads. This is especially useful for in-memory file objects.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from flask import send_file
from io import BytesIO

def download_csv():
    csv_data = BytesIO(b'name,age\nJohn,30')
    return send_file(csv_data)  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
from flask import send_file
from io import BytesIO

def download_csv():
    csv_data = BytesIO(b'name,age\nJohn,30')
    return send_file(csv_data, attachment_filename='data.csv', as_attachment=True)
----

You can provide both parameters for complete control over the response headers.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from flask import send_file
from io import StringIO

def download_log():
    log_data = StringIO('INFO: Application started')
    return send_file(log_data)  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
from flask import send_file
from io import StringIO

def download_log():
    log_data = StringIO('INFO: Application started')
    return send_file(log_data, mimetype='text/plain', attachment_filename='app.log')
