Validating SSL/TLS connections is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5531[CVE-2014-5531]
* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5524[CVE-2014-5524]
* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5574[CVE-2014-5574]

SSL/TLS protocols encrypt network connections. The server usually provides a digital certificate to prove its identity. Accepting all SSL/TLS certificates makes your application vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM).


This rule will raise an issue when a method named ``++onReceivedSslError++`` with first argument of type ``++android.webkit.WebView++`` is defined.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* invalid SSL/TLS certificates are accepted automatically.
* The user is asked to accept invalid SSL/TLS certificates.

You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Accept only trusted SSL/TLS certificates.
* Do not ask users to accept unsafe connections as they are unlikely to make an informed security decision.


== Sensitive Code Example

Android (See also https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7071387?hl=en["How to address WebView SSL Error Handler alerts in your apps."])

package com.example.myapplication.rspec_5326;

import android.net.http.SslError;
import android.os.Build;
import android.support.annotation.RequiresApi;
import android.webkit.SslErrorHandler;
import android.webkit.WebView;
import android.webkit.WebViewClient;

import java.util.function.Function;

public class SSLTLSValidation extends WebViewClient {
    private final Function<SslError, Boolean> acceptSslError;

    SSLTLSValidation(Function<SslError, Boolean> acceptSslError) {
        this.acceptSslError = acceptSslError;
    }

    @RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.N)
    @Override
    public void onReceivedSslError(WebView view, SslErrorHandler handler, SslError error) { // Sensitive
        if (acceptSslError.apply(error)) {
            handler.proceed();
        } else {
            handler.cancel();
        }
    }
}

We could define a vulnerability rule as many projects on Github have just ``++handler.proceed();++`` in ``++onReceivedSslError++``. But the usefulness of such a rule might be limited as it seems that https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7071387?hl=en[Google validates the plugins]. We should first check if Google is able to detect every simple case.
