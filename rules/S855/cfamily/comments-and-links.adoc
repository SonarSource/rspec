MISRA C:2004 says: "Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to a function and any type *other than an integral type*" (emphasis mine), meaning a cast to an integral type is allowed.


MISRA {cpp}:2008: "A cast should not convert a pointer type to an integral type." I.e. a direct contradiction of the second part of the C:2004 rule.


MISRA C:2012 backs up {cpp}:2008: "Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to a function and any other type."


So... what would you like written up?
