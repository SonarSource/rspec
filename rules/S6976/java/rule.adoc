== Why is this an issue?

Stream operations are divided into intermediate and terminal operations, and are combined to form stream pipelines.
A stream should be operated on (invoking an intermediate or terminal stream operation) only once.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
Stream<Widget> pipeline = widgets.stream().filter(b -> b.getColor() == Color.RED);
var res1 = pipeline.findAny();
var res2 = pipeline.mapToInt(b -> b.getWeight()).sum(); // Noncompliant
----

=== Message

Refactor this code so that this consumed stream pipeline is not reused.


=== Highlighting

Primary: Operation invoked on consumed stream

Secondary: The previous terminal operation on that stream
