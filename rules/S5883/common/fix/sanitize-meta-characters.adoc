==== Neutralize special characters

When the application needs to execute complex commands that require
user-controlled data to be inserted directly into a process invocation command,
it is cleanest to use process call libraries that provide argument sanitization
internally, such as {sanitizationLib}.

To prevent new commands from being launched, the library will remove
common dangerous characters, such as:

* `&`
* `|`
* `;`
* `$`
* `>`
* `<`
* `\``
* `\\`
* `!`

If user input is to be included in the arguments of a command, the application
must ensure that no other arbitrary argument can be added. To this end, the
application must ensure that dangerous options or argument delimiters are
neutralized too. +

Argument delimiters include `'`, `-` and `spaces`.
