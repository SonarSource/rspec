==== Neutralize special characters

If the application is to execute complex commands that require user-controlled
data to be inserted directly into a program invokation command, the cleanest
approach is to use process invokation libraries that internally provide
argument sanitization, such as {sanitizationLib}.

To prevent new commands to start, the library helps you get rid of common
dangerous characters, such as:

* `&`
* `|`
* `;`
* `$`
* `>`
* `<`
* `\``
* `\\`
* `!`

If user input is to be included in the arguments of a command, the application
must ensure that no additional arbitrary argument can be added. To do so, the
application needs to ensure that dangerous options or argument delimiters are
neutralized. +
Argument delimiters count `'`, `-` and spaces.
