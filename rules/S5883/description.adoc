Applications that allow execution of operating system commands from user-controlled data should control the arguments passed to the command, otherwise an attacker can inject additional arbitrary arguments which can change the behavior of the command.

User-controlled arguments should be sanitized by neutralizing argument delimiters (eg: `'`, space, `-`) and thus preventing injection of unwanted additional arguments. A single user-controlled argument may still lead to vulnerabilities if it corresponds to a dangerous option supported by the command, such as `-exec` available with https://linux.die.net/man/1/find[find], in that case, mark end of option processing on the command line using `--` (double-dash) or restrict the options to only trusted values.
