OS command argument injections occur when applications allow the execution of
operating system commands from untrusted data but the untrusted data is limited
to the arguments. It is not possible to directly inject arbitrary commands that
compromise the underlying operating system, but the behavior of the executed
command still might be influenced in a way that allows to expand access, for
example, execution of arbitrary commands. The security of the application
depends on the behavior of the application that is executed.
