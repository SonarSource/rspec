=== How to fix it in Java SE

The following code uses the `find` command and expects the user to enter the
name of a file to find on the system.

It is vulnerable to arguments injection because untrusted data is inserted
directly into the arguments of a process call without sanitization. +
The application assumes that incoming data always consists of a specific range
of characters and ignores that some characters might force the `find` command
to start a shell.

In this particular case, an attacker may remove files in `/some/folder` with the following string:

----
'*' -exec rm -rf {} \; 
----

[cols="a"]

    }
}

++java.lang.Runtime++ is sometimes used over ++java.lang.ProcessBuilder++ due to ease of use. Flexibility in methods often introduces security issues as edge cases are easily missed. The compliant solution logic is also applied to ++java.lang.ProcessBuilder++.

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/introduction.adoc[]

:sanitizationLib: java.lang.Runtime.exec(String[] cmdarray)
include::../../common/fix/sanitize-meta-characters.adoc[]

Here `java.lang.Runtime.exec(String[] cmdarray)` takes care of escaping the passed arguments and internally
creates a single string given to the operating system to be executed.
