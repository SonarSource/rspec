== Why is this an issue?

The use of a string literal in a boolean test is likely an error since the test will always evaluate to true (i.e. the string is a non-0 value).


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
if ("foo") { // Noncompliant - always evaluates to true
  ...
} else {
  // unreachable, never executed
}
----
