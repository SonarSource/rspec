== Why is this an issue?

As soon as a closable statement contains some nested statements, it could quickly become difficult to see which statements are nested and which are not. That's why ending a list of nested statements by END-${STATEMENT-NAME} is advised.


The following code snippet illustrates this rule:

----
READ DF-PARAM-SPILOTE AT END
  GO TO F-LECT-SPILOTE.   *> Non-Compliant
...
IF SOMETHING
  MOVE A TO B.
END-IF.                                    *> Compliant
...
----
