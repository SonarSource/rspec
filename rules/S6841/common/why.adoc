== Why is this an issue?

Positive ``++tabIndex++`` values can disrupt the natural tab order of the webpage. This can be confusing for screen reader users who rely on a logical tab order to navigate through the content. If the tab order doesn't match the visual or logical order of elements, users may struggle to understand the page structure.

Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using positive ``++tabIndex++`` values.
