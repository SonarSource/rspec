== How to fix it

If you need to make an element focusable that isn't by default (like a ``++<div>++`` or ``++<span>++``), you can use ``++tabIndex="0"++``. This will add the element to the natural tab order based on its position in the HTML. Otherwise, either remove the ``++tabIndex++`` value or use ``++tabIndex="-1"++`` to remove the element from the tab order.
