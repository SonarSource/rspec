Partially-initialized objects are surprising to the `class` users
and might lead to hard-to-catch bugs.
``class``es with constructors are expected to have all members initialized after their constructor finishes.

This rule raises an issue when some members are left uninitialized after a constructor finishes.

== Why is this an issue?

In the following example, `PartInit::x` is left uninitialized after the constructor finishes.

[source,cpp]
----
struct AutomaticallyInitialized {
  int x;
  AutomaticallyInitialized() : x(0) {}
};

struct PartInit {
  AutomaticallyInitialized ai;
  int x;
  int y;
  PartInit(int n) :y(n) {
    // this->ai is initialized
    // this->y is initialized
    // Noncompliant: this->x is left uninitialized
  }
};
----

This leads to garbage being printed in benign-looking code like this:

[source,cpp]
----
PartInit pi(1);
std::cout <<pi.y;
----

For this reason, constructors should always initialize all data members of a class.

While in some cases data members are initialized by their default constructor,
in others, they are left with garbage.

Trivial types with a ``++default++``ed or implicit default constructor follow the aggregate initialization syntax:
if you omit them in the initialization list, they will not be initialized.

[source,cpp]
----
struct Trivial {
  int x;
  int y;
};
struct Container {
  Trivial t;
  int arr[2];
  Container() {
    // Noncompliant
    // this->t is not initialized
    // this->t.x and this->t.y contain garbage
    // this->arr contains garbage
  }
  Container(int) :t{}, arr{} {
    // Compliant
    // this->t.x and this->t.y are initialized to 0
    // this->arr is initialized to {0, 0}
  }
  Container(int, int) :t{1}, arr{1} {
    // Compliant
    // this->t.x is 1
    // this->t.y is 0
    // this->arr is initialized to {1, 0}
  }
};
struct DefaultedContainer {
  Trivial t;
  int arr[2];
  DefaultedContainer() = default; // Noncompliant
  // this->t and this->arr are not initialized
};
----

The same is true for an explicit ``++default++``ed default constructor.
[source,cpp]
----
struct Defaulted {
  int x;
  Defaulted() = default;
};
struct ContainerDefaulted {
  Defaulted d;
  ContainerDefaulted() {
    // Noncompliant this->d.x is not initialized
  }
};
----


Even if some of the members have class initializers,
the other members are still not initialized by default.

[source,cpp]
----
struct Partial {
  int x;
  int y = 1;
  int z;
};
struct ContainerPartial {
  Partial p;
  ContainrePartial() {
    // Noncompliant
    // this->p.x is not initialized
    // this->p.y is initialized to 1
    // this->p.z is not initialized
  }
  ContainrePartial(bool) :p{3} {
    // Compliant
    // this->p.x is initialized to 3
    // this->p.y is initialized to 1
    // this->p.z is initialized to 0
  }
};

=== What is the potential impact?

It is a common expectation that an object be in a fully-initialized state after its construction.
A partially initialized object breaks this assumption.

This comes with all the risks associated with uninitialized variables,
and these risks propagate to all the classes using the faulty class as a type
as a base class or a data member.
This is all the more surprising
that most programmers expect a constructor to correctly initialize the members of its class.

include::../../../shared_content/cfamily/garbage_value_impact.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

Aggregate classes do not initialize most of their data members
(unless you explicitly value initialize them with `x{}` or `x()`)
but allow their users to use nice and flexible initialization syntax.
They will be ignored by this rule (but are the subject of rule S5558).

== How to fix it

To avoid partially-initialized objects,
all non `+class+`-type fields should always be initialized (in order of preference):

* With an in-class initializer
* In the initialization list of a constructor
* In the constructor body

See rule S3230 for more details about this order.

If none of the above places is a good fit for a data member,
ask yourself whether it belongs to this class.
Instead of a data member, it might be more appropriate to keep the value

- as part of the class of a data member
  (delegating initialization to the constructor of the member type),
- in a derived class (delegating initialization to the derived class),
- in a (potentially `static`) local variable of a member function, or
- in a parameter of a member function.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class C {
  int val = 42;
};

class S {
public:
  C c;
  int i;
  int j;

  S() : i(0) {} // Noncompliant: this->j is left uninitialized
  S(bool) : i(0), j(0) {}
};

class T {
public:
  S s;

  T() : s() {} // Noncompliant: s.j is left uninitialized
  T(bool b) : s(b) {}
};

class U {
public:
  T t;

  U() : t() {} // Noncompliant: t.s.j is left uninitialized
};
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class C {
  int val = 42;
};

class S_fixed {
public:
  C c;
  int i;
  int j;

  S_fixed() : i(0), j(0) {} // Compliant
  S_fixed(bool) : i(0), j(0) {}
};

class T_fixed {
public:
  S_fixed s;

  T_fixed() : s() {}  // Compliant
  T_fixed(bool b) : s(b) {}
};

class U {
public:
  T t;

  U() : t() { t.s.j = 0; }  // Compliant
};

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]

struct Partial {
  int x;
  int y = 1;
};
struct ContainerPartial {
  Partial p;
  ContainrePartial() {
    // Noncompliant: this->p.x is not initialized
  }
};

struct Partial {
  int x = 0;
  int y = 1;
};
struct ContainerPartial {
  Partial p;
  ContainrePartial() {
