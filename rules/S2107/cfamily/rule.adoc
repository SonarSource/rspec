== Why is this an issue?

In a {cpp} class, all member variables of a type with an implicit or explicit constructor will be automatically initialized. This is not the case for the others: if no initialization is explicitly written, the variable will be left uninitialized.


This comes with all the risks associated with uninitialized variables, and these risks propagate to all the classes using  the faulty class as a type. This is all the more surprising that most programmers expect a constructor to correctly initialize the members of its class (this is its raison d'être after all).


To avoid such situations, all non class type fields should always be initialized (in order of preference):

* With an in-class initializer
* In the initialization list of a constructor
* In the constructor body

See S3230 for more details about this order.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class C {
  int val = 42;
};

class S {
public:
  C c;
  int i;
  int j;

  S() : i(0) {} // Noncompliant: this->j is left uninitialized
  S(bool) : i(0), j(0) {}
};

class T {
public:
  S s;

  T() : s() {} // Noncompliant: s.j is left uninitialized
  T(bool b) : s(b) {}
};

class U {
public:
  T t;

  U() : t() {} // Noncompliant: t.s.j is left uninitialized
};
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class C {
  int val = 42;
};

class S_fixed {
public:
  C c;
  int i;
  int j;

  S_fixed() : i(0), j(0) {} // Compliant
  S_fixed(bool) : i(0), j(0) {}
};

class T_fixed {
public:
  S _fixed s;

  T_fixed() : s() {}  // Compliant
  T_fixed(bool b) : s(b) {}
};

class U {
public:
  T t;

  U() : t() { t.s.j = 0; }  // Compliant
};
----

=== Exceptions

Aggregate classes do not initialize most of their data members, but allow their users to use nice and flexible initialization syntax. They will be ignored by this rule (but are the subject of S5558).
