External requests initiated by a WordPress server should be considered as security-sensitive. They may contain sensitive data which is stored in the files or in the database of the server. It's important for the administrator of a WordPress server to understand what they contain and to which server they are sent.

WordPress makes it possible to block external requests by setting the `WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL` option to `true`. It's then possible to authorize requests to only a few servers using another option named `WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS`.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* Your WordPress website contains code which may call external requests to servers you don't know.
* Your WordPress website may send sensitive data to other servers.
* Your WordPress website uses a lot of plugins or themes.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Uninstall WordPress plugins which send requests to servers you don't know.
* Make sure that `WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL` is defined in `wp-config.php`.
* Make sure that `WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL` is set to `true`.
* Make sure that `WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS` is configured to authorize requests to the servers you trust.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
define( 'WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL', false ); // Sensitive
----


== Compliant Solution

----
define( 'WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL', true );
define( 'WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS', 'api.wordpress.org' );
----
