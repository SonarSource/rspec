This rule raises an issue when built-in constructors are called without the `new` keyword (except for `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, and `BigInt` which should not use `new`).

== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript allows calling most built-in constructors both with and without the `new` keyword, but this inconsistency can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.

For most built-in constructors like `Array`, `Object`, `Date`, `Map`, etc., both `Array()` and `new Array()` work the same way. However, using `new` makes the intent clearer - you are creating a new instance of an object. This consistency helps other developers understand your code better.

There are important exceptions: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, and `BigInt` should NOT use `new`. When called without `new`, these functions convert values to primitive types. When called with `new`, they create wrapper objects instead of primitives, which is rarely what you want and can cause unexpected behavior in comparisons and type checks.

For example, `new String('hello')` creates a String object, while `String('hello')` creates a primitive string. The object version behaves differently in boolean contexts and equality comparisons.

=== What is the potential impact?

Inconsistent constructor usage reduces code readability and maintainability. Using `new` with primitive wrapper constructors (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`) creates wrapper objects that can cause subtle bugs in equality comparisons and type checks, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior.

=== How to fix?


Add the `new` keyword when calling built-in constructors (except for primitive wrapper constructors).

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const list = Array(10); // Noncompliant
const now = Date(); // Noncompliant
const map = Map([['foo', 'bar']]); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const list = new Array(10);
const now = new Date();
const map = new Map([['foo', 'bar']]);
