Some COBOL compilers such as IBM one will assume that the minimum value of ``++OCCURS DEPENDING ON++`` is 1 but nothing is enforcing that and this behaviour can change or be different when using another compiler.

Setting the minimum value of ``++OCCURS DEPENDING ON++`` makes the code more readable, and less dependent on compiler.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
01 MY-TABLE-COUNT PIC S9(4) BINARY.
01 MY-TABLE.
   03 MY-ITEM OCCURS 500 TIMES          *> Noncompliant
       DEPENDING ON MY-TABLE-COUNT.
      05 MY-FIELD-01 PIC X(08).
      05 MY-FIELD-02 PIC 9(05).
----


== Compliant Solution

----
01 MY-TABLE-COUNT PIC S9(4) BINARY.
01 MY-TABLE.
   03 MY-ITEM OCCURS 1 TO 500 TIMES          *> Compliant; minimum value is 1
       DEPENDING ON MY-TABLE-COUNT.
      05 MY-FIELD-01 PIC X(08).
      05 MY-FIELD-02 PIC 9(05).
