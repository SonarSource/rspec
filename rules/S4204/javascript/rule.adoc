== Why is this an issue?

Variables can be declared with or without types. Variables declared without a type will be implicitly typed if the declaration includes an initialization, and the compiler then type-checks every usage of typed variables. On the other hand, a variable declared with the ``++any++`` type explicitly instructs the compiler not to do any type-checking, which is risky.

The ``++unknown++`` type should be preferred over the ``++any++`` type if it’s not possible to have a better typing. ``++any++`` fully disables type-checking allowing to do anything with the variable, while ``++unknown++`` requires to narrow the type before doing something specific.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
let a = 42;  // implicitly typed to number
let b: number = 42;  // explicitly typed to number
let c: any = 42;  // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
let a = 42;
let b: number = 42;
let c: number = 42;
----
