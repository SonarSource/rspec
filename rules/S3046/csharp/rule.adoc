The ``++Monitor.Pulse++`` call releases the object on which it was called and wakes up the first thread waiting for the lock on that object. Significantly, it only releases _one_ lock, and if multiple locks are held when it is called deadlocks could result.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void doSomething(Object obj) 
{  
  lock (this) //first lock
  {
    lock (obj) {  // second lock
      // ...
      Monitor.Pulse(obj); // Noncompliant; only the second lock is released
    }
  }
}
