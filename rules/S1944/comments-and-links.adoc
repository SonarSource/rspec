2 items of note:

* spec-ed for C because of pointer casting
* tagged to CWE-588 because the mitigations section lists making sure your casts are appropriate. Don't know if this is too tenuous a link or not.

CERT lists these as relevant:

Additionally, these seem relevant to me:

* MISRA C:2004, 10.3, 10.4, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 5-2-5, 5-2-6, 5-2-7, 5-2-8, 5-2-9

But is that "cast"-ing too broad a net?

No issue for java for the scope regarding casting to unrelated type. 

But for me it is out of scope of this rule to detect untested ("untested" has to be define) down cast. This would require another rule I think.

\[~nicolas.peru], you couldn't look for the downcast to be inside an ``++instanceof++`` condition?

\[~ann.campbell.2] If I take the example of the java syntax tree here is how we downcast : 


----
if(tree.is(Tree.Kind.TYPE_CAST)) {
  TypeCastTree typeCastTree = (TypeCastTree) tree;
}
----

and we even have some usages that are based on safe assumptions (SubscriptionVisitor) for instance.


So I tend to think that this usecase will trigger way too many false positive (at least in our codebase) to be useful.

In fact problem is the same as for the first case, see my comment in \http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONARJAVA-723 :  problem is to detect how the type has been tested.

During a LaYC sprint, I removed dummy implementations for the following language:

* abap
* flex
* javascript
* python

It is not implemented in the corresponding analyzer and there currently are no tickets open in order to do so.
