<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_breach_of_trust_in_non_repudiation_and_disruption_of_the_audit_trail">Breach of trust in non-repudiation and disruption of the audit trail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When such a secret is compromised, malicious actors might have the possibility
to send malicious event objects, causing discrepancies in the audit trail. This
can make it difficult to trace and verify the sequence of events, impacting the
ability to investigate and identify unauthorized or fraudulent activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All in all, this can lead to problems in proving the validity of transactions
or actions performed, potentially leading to disputes and legal complications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_modification_of_application_data">Modification of application data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications may rely on data that cannot be distributed with the application
code. This may be due to the size of the data, or because the data is regularly
updated. This data is downloaded by the application as it is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an attacker can gain access to an authentication secret, they may be able to
alter or delete this application data. This may cause parts of the application
to misbehave or stop working. Maliciously altered data could also contain
undesirable content which results in reputational damage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_exceeding_rate_limits">Exceeding rate limits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a leaked secret, an attacker may be able to make hundreds or thousands of
authenticated calls to an online service. It is common for online services to
enforce a rate limit to prevent their servers from being overwhelmed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an attacker is able to exceed a user-based rate limit, they may be able to
cause a denial of service for the user. If this continues over a long period of
time, the user may also be subject to additional fees or may have their account
terminated.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use templating to insert values during deployment</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some deployment scenarios may require secrets to be stored in files on disk. In
these cases, the configuration file should be modified during deployment so that
it contains secrets appropriate for the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The safest way to create configuration files is to use a templating engine
during the deployment process. These engines provide a reliable method for
replacing placeholders inside the template, ensuring that no placeholder is
missed. They also typically raise warnings a configuration value is missing,
helping to identify and diagnose bad deployments.</p>
