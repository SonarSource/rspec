== Why is this an issue?

Where multiple declarators appear in the same declaration the type of an identifier may not meet developer expectations.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int i1; int j1; // Compliant, but not preferred
int i2, *j2; // Noncompliant
int *i3,                  
    &j3 = i2; // Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int i1; 
int j1;
int i2;
int *j2;
int *i3;
int &j3 = i2;
----
