== Why is this an issue?

Declaring multiple variables or members on the same line hinders readability. Moreover, as soon as they contain references, pointers, or assignments, they become confusing for maintainers.

This rule raises an issue when a declaration declares multiple variables or members.

[source,cpp]
----
int i1, j1; // Noncompliant
int i2, *j2; // Noncompliant
int *i3,                  
    &j3 = i2; // Noncompliant
----

Giving each declaration its own line makes the code more maintainable.

[source,cpp]
----
int i1; 
int j1;
int i2;
int *j2;
int *i3;
int &j3 = i2;
----
