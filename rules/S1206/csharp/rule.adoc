== Why is this an issue?

There is a contract between https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.equals[Object.Equals] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode[Object.GetHashCode]: If two objects are equal according to the `Equals` method, then calling `GetHashCode` on each of them must yield the same integer. If this is not the case, many collections, such as a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.hashtable[Hashtable] or a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2[Dictionary] won't handle class instances correctly.

In order to comply with the contract, `Equals` and `GetHashCode` should be either both inherited, or both overridden.

== How to fix it

When you want to use `Equals` and `GetHashCode`, either override both of them, or simply inherit them.

=== Code example

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass   // Noncompliant: should also override GetHashCode
{
    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass
{
    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

This [class|struct] overrides "GetHashCode()|Equals()" and should therefore also override "GetHashCode()|Equals()".
