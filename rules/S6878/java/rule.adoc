== Why is this an issue?

Java 21 enhances Pattern Matching, introduced in Java 16, with a _record pattern_ that decomposes records into local variables.
This form should be used when all fields of a record are accessed within a block for improved readability.
Nested record patterns are also allowed and should be used when a record field is another record, and all its fields are accessed.

== Exceptions

This rule does not apply in the following cases:

- When not all record fields are accessed. This prevents the creation of unused local variables in the decomposed record structure.
- When a variable with the field name would cause a name conflict with another local variable or would shadow a field in the current class.
  This means that this rule does not enforce record patterns if they would or should use renamed variables.

== How to fix it

Replace the instance check or simple pattern matching with a record pattern.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

This example uses pattern matching but not a record pattern, even though all fields of the record are accessed in the block.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
record Point(Float x, Float y, Float z) {}

void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point p) { // Noncompliant, because all three fields x, y, z are accessed
        Float x = p.x;
        Float y = p.y();
        System.out.println(x + y + p.z);
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

The compliant example uses a record pattern to decompose the record structure.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
record Point(Float x, Float y, Float z) {}

void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point(Float x, Float y, Float z)) { // Compliant
        System.out.println(x + y + z);
    }
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

This example does not use pattern matching or a record pattern.
Rule _https://sonarsource.github.io/rspec/#/rspec/S6201[S6201 - Pattern matching or "instanceOf" operator should be used]_ would report first.
When fixed using simple pattern matching instead of a record pattern, this rule (S6878) will report.

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point) { // Noncompliant
        Point p = (Point) obj;
        Float x = p.x;
        Float y = p.y();
        System.out.println(x + y + p.z);
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

The solution compliant with both rules, S6201 and S6878, uses pattern matching and decomposes the record structure using a record pattern.

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point(Float x, Float y, Float z)) { // Compliant
        System.out.println(x + y + z);
    }
}
----


==== Noncompliant code example

This example is noncompliant because a nested record pattern could have been used.

[source,java,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
record Plane(Point normal, Float d) {}

void print(Object obj) {
    // Noncompliant, because all field of "normal" are accessed
    if (obj instanceof Plane(Point normal, Float d)) {
        System.out.println(normal.x + normal.y + normal.z);
        System.out.println(d);
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

This is the same example using a nested record pattern.

[source,java,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Plane(Point(Float x, Float y, Float z), Float d)) { // Compliant
        System.out.println(x + y + z);
        System.out.println(d);
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

This example uses `var` instead of replicating the field types in the record pattern, which is less verbose and keeps the code more readable, especially in the case of longer type names.
Also, it uses variable names that do not match the original field names.
The reason for this can be to avoid name collisions with fields or other local variables.

[source,java]
----
void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point(var px, var py, var pz)) { // Compliant
        System.out.println(px + py + pz);
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

This example is compliant without using a record pattern, as it does not access all fields.

[source,java]
----
void print(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point p) { // Compliant, because z is never accessed
        Float x = p.x;
        Float y = p.y();
        System.out.println(x + y);
    }
}
