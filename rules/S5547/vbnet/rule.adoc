== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

For https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=netcore-3.1[System.Security.Cryptography] library, these old cryptographic algorithms should no longer be used for any reason:

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim TripleDES1 As new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider() ' Noncompliant: Triple DES is vulnerable to meet-in-the-middle attack

Dim SimpleDES As New DESCryptoServiceProvider() ' Noncompliant: DES works with 56-bit keys allow attacks via exhaustive search

Dim RC2 As new RC2CryptoServiceProvider() ' Noncompliant: RC2 is vulnerable to a related-key attack
----
For Bouncycastle library, https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000339[AESFastEngine has a side channel leak], it is possible to gain information about the key used to initialize the cipher:

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim AesFast As new AesFastEngine() ' Noncompliant
----

=== Compliant solution

For https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=netcore-3.1[System.Security.Cryptography] library, it's recommended to use ``++AesCryptoServiceProvider++``:

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim AES As new AesCryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant
----
For Bouncycastle library, it's recommended to use ``++AESEngine++``:

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim AES As new AESEngine() ' Compliant
----
