https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_cryptography[Strong cipher algorithms] are cryptographic systems resistant to cryptanalysis, they are not vulnerable to well-known attacks like brute force attacks for example.

A general recommendation is to only use cipher algorithms intensively tested and promoted by the cryptographic community.

More specifically for block cipher, it's not recommended to use algorithm with a block size inferior than 128 bits.
