Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring secure communication in various domains. They are used for several
important reasons:

* Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection.
* Security during transmission or on storage devices.
* Data integrity, general trust, and authentication.

When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also
consider two things:

1. No encryption is unbreakable.
2. The strength of an encryption algorithm is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame.

For these reasons, as soon as cryptography is included in a project, it is
important to choose encryption algorithms that are considered strong and secure
by the cryptography community.
