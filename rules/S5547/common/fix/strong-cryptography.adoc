It is highly recommended to use an algorithm that is currently considered secure
by the cryptographic community. A common choice for such an algorithm is the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

For block ciphers, it is not recommended to use algorithms with a block size
that is smaller than 128 bits.
