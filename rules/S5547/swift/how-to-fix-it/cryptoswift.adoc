== How to fix it in CommonCrypto

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import CryptoSwift

let blowfish = try Blowfish(key: key, blockMode: GCM(iv: iv, mode: .combined), padding: .pkcs7) // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import CryptoSwift

let aes = try AES(key: key, iv: iv)
----
