Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring secure communications in a variety of domains. They are used for
several important reasons:

* Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection
* Security during transmission or on storage devices
* Data integrity, general trust, and authentication

When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also
consider two things:

1. No encryption is unbreakable.
2. The strength of an encryption algorithm is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame.

In today's cryptography, the length of the prime number used directly affects
the security level of cryptographic algorithms. The larger the prime number,
the more secure it is and the longer this data can be considered secure by its
administrators.

Note that said prime numbers are also called *keys*.

If an application uses a prime number that is considered short and *unsecure*,
the encrypted data is exposed to attacks aimed at getting at the plaintext.

In general, it is best practice to expect a breach: that a user or organization
with malicious intent will perform mathematical attacks on this data after
obtaining it by other means.
