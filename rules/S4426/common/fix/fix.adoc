As a rule of thumb, use the cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms that are
considered strong by the cryptographic community.

The best choices are currently the following.

RSA

DSA

In cryptography, DL groups are used in various protocols and algorithms, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange and DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm).

Diffie Hellman (DH)

EC keys in general, for ASN1 for example:

secp112r1. the letters have the following meanings:

* "sec": It stands for the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG), an organization that publishes standards for elliptic curve cryptography.
* "p": It indicates that the curve is defined over a prime field.
* "112": It represents the size of the prime modulus in bits, indicating that the curve has a 112-bit prime modulus.
* "r1": It denotes the version of the curve. In this case, "r1" indicates the first version of the curve.
