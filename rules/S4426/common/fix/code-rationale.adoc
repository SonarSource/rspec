The following code examples either explicitly or implicitly generate prime
numbers for cryptographic purposes.

Note that there are differences in the size of the prime numbers depending on
the algorithm.

Due to the mathematical properties of the algorithms, the security requirements
for the key size vary depending on the algorithm. +
For example, a 256-bit ECC key provides about the same level of security as a
3072-bit RSA key and a 128-bit symmetric key.
