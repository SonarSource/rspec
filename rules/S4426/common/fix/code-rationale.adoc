The following code examples either explicitly or implicitly generate keys.
Note that there are differences in the size of the keys depending on the
algorithm.

Due to the mathematical properties of the algorithms, the security requirements
for the key size vary depending on the algorithm. +
For example, a 256-bit ECC key provides about the same level of security as a
3072-bit RSA key and a 128-bit symmetric key.
