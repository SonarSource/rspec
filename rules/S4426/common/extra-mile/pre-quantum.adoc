==== Pre-Quantum Cryptography

Encrypted data and communications recorded today could be decrypted in the
future by an attack from a quantum computer. +
It is important to keep in mind that NIST-approved digital signature schemes,
key agreement, and key transport may need to be replaced with secure
quantum-resistant (or "post-quantum") counterpart.

Thus, if data is to remain secure beyond 2030, proactive measures should be
taken now to ensure its safety.
