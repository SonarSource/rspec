== Why is this an issue?

Parameters that are declared as "INONLY" or "NONASSIGNABLE" are flagged as non-assignable by the compiler.


This rule raises an issue when a non-assignable parameter is written to.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,pli]
----
sum: PROC(a, b);
   dcl a fixed dec(15,2) NONASSIGNABLE;
   dcl b fixed dec(15,2) NONASSIGNABLE;
   a = a + b; /* Noncompliant */
   return (a);
end;
