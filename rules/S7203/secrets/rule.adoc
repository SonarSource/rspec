=== What is the potential impact?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/private_key_disclosure.adoc[]

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/impact/supply_chain_attack.adoc[]

If a third party gets access to an Android or iOS app signing key, this person could sign and distribute malicious apps under the same identity as the original app.

== How to fix it

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/store_separately.adoc[]

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/revoke.adoc[]

In most cases, if the key is used as part of a larger trust model (X509, PGP,
etc), it is necessary to issue and publish a revocation certificate. Doing so
will ensure that all people and assets that rely on this key for security
operations are aware of its compromise and stop trusting it.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
keytool -genkey \
    -keystore release.jks \
    -alias release \
    -keyalg RSA \
    -keysize 2048 \
    -validity 1000 \
    -dname "CN=com.example" \
    -storepass release # Noncompliant, keystore password is easy to guess
----

==== Compliant solution

Keychain files should be created using a strong password.

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
echo $STRONG_PWD | keytool -genkey \
    -keystore release.jks \
    -alias release \
    -keyalg RSA \
    -keysize 2048 \
    -validity 1000 \
    -dname "CN=com.example"
----

Files containing cryptographic keys should not be commited with the application codebase and should be distributed separately.
