When you annotate an https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.enum?[Enum] with the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.flagsattribute[Flags attribute], you must not rely on the automatically set value of the `Enum` members, but you should define the enumeration constants in powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, and so on). Automatic value initialization will set the first member to zero and increment the value by one for each subsequent member. As a result, you wonâ€™t be able to use the enum members with bitwise operators.
