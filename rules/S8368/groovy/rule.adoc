This is an issue when using 'extension' as an identifier (class name, method name, variable name, etc.) in C# 14 or later without the '@' escape prefix.

== Why is this an issue?

Starting with C# 14, 'extension' becomes a contextual keyword used for extension containers. When the compiler encounters 'extension' in certain contexts, it tries to parse it as this new language feature rather than as a regular identifier.

This change can cause compilation errors in existing code that uses 'extension' as an identifier. For example, a class named 'extension' will be interpreted as an extension container declaration, leading to parsing failures.

The '@' prefix tells the compiler to treat the word as a regular identifier rather than a keyword, resolving the ambiguity and allowing the code to compile correctly.

=== What is the potential impact?

Code that previously compiled successfully will fail to compile with C# 14 or later. This can break builds and prevent applications from being updated to newer language versions.

== How to fix it

Add the '@' prefix before 'extension' when using it as a class name, constructor name, or method name.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class extension
{
    extension(object o) { } // Noncompliant
    extension M() { } // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class @extension
{
    @extension(object o) { }
    @extension M() { }
}
----
