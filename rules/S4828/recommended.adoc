== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* For stateful applications with user management, ensure that only administrators trigger this code.
* Verify that the `pid` and `sig` parameters are correct before using them.
* Ensure that the process sending the signals runs with as few OS privileges as possible.
* Isolate the process on the system based on its (E)UID.
* Ensure that the signal does not interrupt any essential functions when intercepted by a target's signal handlers.
