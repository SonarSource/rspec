* For stateful applications with user management, ensure that only administrators trigger this code.
* Validate that the `pid` and `sig` parameters are correct before using them.
* Set as few UNIX permissions as possible for the process that sends signals.
* Ensure that signal handlers of targets do not stop any essential functions.
