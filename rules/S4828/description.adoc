Signaling processes or process groups is dangerous and can seriously affect the
stability of this application or others located on the same system.

Mistakenly setting a wrong `pid`, a wrong `signal`, or allowing untrusted
sources to assign arbitrary values to these parameters can lead to a denial of
service.

In addition, the system treats the signal differently if the destination `pid`
is less than or equal to 0. This different behavior can compromise multiple
processes simultaneously if the call is uncontrolled.
