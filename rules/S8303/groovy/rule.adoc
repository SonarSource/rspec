This rule raises an issue when a star import (import package.*) is used to import all classes from a package.

== Why is this an issue?

Star imports bring all public classes from a package into the local namespace, which creates several problems:

**Namespace pollution**: Star imports clutter the local namespace with many classes that may not be used, making it harder to understand which classes are actually needed.

**Unclear dependencies**: When reading code, it becomes difficult to determine which specific classes come from which packages, reducing code readability and making maintenance more challenging.

**Potential naming conflicts**: If multiple packages contain classes with the same name, star imports can lead to ambiguous references and compilation errors.

**IDE performance**: Some development environments may experience slower performance when processing large numbers of imported classes.

Explicit imports make code dependencies clear and help maintain a clean, understandable codebase.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using star imports can make code harder to understand and maintain. It may lead to naming conflicts when classes from different packages have the same name, and can make it difficult for developers to track which specific classes are being used from imported packages.

== How to fix it

Replace star imports with explicit imports for each class you actually use. This makes your dependencies clear and prevents namespace pollution.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import groovy.xml.*
import java.util.*
import java.io.*

// It's unclear which classes are being used
def markupBuilder = new MarkupBuilder() // Noncompliant
def list = new ArrayList() // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder
import java.util.ArrayList

// Clear which classes are being used
def markupBuilder = new MarkupBuilder()
def list = new ArrayList()
----
