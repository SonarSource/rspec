``++setjmp.h++`` functions allow the normal function mechanisms to be bypassed and should be used only with extreme caution, if at all. 


Calling ``++setjmp++`` saves the program environment into the buffer passed into the call. Later calling ``++longjmp++`` returns execution to the point at which ``++setjmp++`` was called and restores the context that was saved into the buffer. But the values of non-volatile local variables after ``++longjmp++`` are indeterminate. Additionally invoking ``++longjmp++`` from a nested signal handler is undefined, as is ``++longjmp++``ing back to a method that has already completed execution.


This rule flags all instances of ``++setjmp++``, ``++_setjmp++``, ``++longjmp++``, ``++_longjmp++``, ``++sigsetjmp++``, ``++siglongjmp++`` and ``++<setjmp.h>++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#include <setjmp.h>  // Noncompliant

jmp_buf buf;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  int i = setjmp(buf);  // Noncompliant
  if (i == 0) { // value of i was assigned after env was saved & will be indeterminate after longjmp();
    // normal execution
  } else { 
    // recover
  }
}

//...

void fun() {
  //...
  longjmp(buf, 1);  // Noncompliant
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // normal execution
}

//...

void fun() {
  //...
}
----
