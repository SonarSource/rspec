== Why is this an issue?

``++enum++``s are usually used to identify distinct elements in a set of values. However ``++enum++``s can be treated as bit fields and bitwise operations can be used on them to combine the values. This is a good way of specifying multiple elements of set with a single value. When ``++enum++``s are used this way, it is a best practice to mark the ``++enum++`` with the ``++FlagsAttribute++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
enum Permissions
{ 
  None = 0,
  Read = 1,   
  Write = 2, 
  Execute = 4 
}
// ...

var x = Permissions.Read | Permissions.Write;  // Noncompliant; enum is not marked with [Flags]
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
[Flags]
enum Permissions
{ 
  None = 0,
  Read = 1, 
  Write = 2, 
  Execute = 4
}
// ...

var x = Permissions.Read | Permissions.Write;
