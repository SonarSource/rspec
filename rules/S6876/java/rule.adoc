== Why is this an issue?

Java 21 introduces the new Sequenced Collections API, which is applicable to all collections with a defined sequence on their elements, such as `LinkedList`, `TreeSet`, and others (see https://openjdk.org/jeps/431[JEP 431]).
For projects using Java 21 and onwards, this API should be utilized instead of workaround implementations that were necessary before Java 21.

This rule identifies instances where a workaround is used to iterate over a collection in reverse order, instead of iterating on the reversed view of the collection.

== How to fix it

Replace the reported statement with a forward-iteration over the reversed view of the collection.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void printLastToFirst(List<String> list) {
  for (var it = list.listIterator(list.size()); it.hasPrevious();) {
    var element = it.previous();
    System.out.println(element);
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void printLastToFirst(List<String> list) {
  for (var element: list.reversed()) {
    System.out.println(element);
  }
}
