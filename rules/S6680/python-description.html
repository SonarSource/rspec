<div class="paragraph">
<p>This vulnerability exposes the system to various operational overloads that can
lead to either a technical denial of service and/or business disruptions.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Loop boundary injections occur in an application when the application retrieves
data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it into a loop or a
function acting as a loop, without sanitizing it first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an application contains a loop that is vulnerable to injections,
it is exposed to attacks that target its availability where that loop is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A user with malicious intent carefully performs actions whose goal is to cause
the loop to run for more iterations than the developer intended, resulting in
unexpected behavior or even a crash of the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After creating the malicious request, the attacker can attack the servers
affected by this vulnerability without relying on any prerequisites.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After discovering the injection point, attackers insert data into the
vulnerable field to either make the affected component inaccessible, attempt a
malfunction, or read from an artifact that exceeds the developer&#8217;s intended
boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In languages that don&#8217;t enforce memory access checks, this can also lead to a
buffer overflow or underflow which may result in sensitive information
disclosure or remote code execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_self_denial_of_service">Self Denial of service</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the component affected by this vulnerability is not a bottleneck that
acts as a single point of failure (SPOF) within the application, the denial of
service might only affect the attacker who initiated it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if the denial of service has little direct impact, it can cause secondary
effects in architectures that use containers and container orchestrators. It
could cause unexpected container failures or resource overconsumption,
for example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_infrastructure_spofs">Infrastructure SPOFs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A denial of service attack can be critical to the enterprise if it
targets a SPOF component. Sometimes the SPOF is a software architecture
vulnerability (such as a single component on which multiple critical components
depend) or an operational vulnerability (for example, insufficient container
creation capabilities or failures from containers to terminate).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In either case, attackers aim to exploit the infrastructure weakness by sending
as many malicious payloads as possible, using potentially huge offensive
infrastructures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These threats are particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).</p>

<p>Validate loop variable values to ensure they fall within the expected bounds.
If a value falls outside of these bounds, reject it as invalid or adjust it to
bring it within bounds. This guarantees that the loop will only iterate over
the expected number of elements or perform the expected number of iterations.</p>

<p>Do not assume that users will provide sensible values. Attackers intentionally
choose unusual values to cause the system to misbehave.</p>
