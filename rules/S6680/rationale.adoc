Loop boundary injections occur in an application when the application retrieves
data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it into a loop or a
function acting as a loop, without sanitizing it first.

If an application contains a loop that is vulnerable to injections, 
it is exposed to attacks that target its availability where that loop is used.

A user with malicious intent carefully performs actions whose goal is to cause
the loop to run for more iterations than the developer intended, resulting in
unexpected behavior or even a crash of the program.

After creating the malicious request, the attacker can attack the servers
affected by this vulnerability without relying on any prerequisites.
