``++@ComponentScan++`` is used to determine which Spring Beans are available in the application context. The packages to scan can be configured thanks to the ``++basePackageClasses++`` or ``++basePackages++`` (or its alias ``++value++``) parameters. If neither parameter is configured, ``++@ComponentScan++`` will consider only the package of the class annotated with it. When ``++@ComponentScan++`` is used on a class belonging to the default package, the entire classpath will be scanned.

This will slow-down the start-up of the application and it is likely the application will fail to start with an ``++BeanDefinitionStoreException++`` because you ended up scanning the Spring Framework package itself.


This rule raises an issue when:

* ``++@ComponentScan++``, ``++@SpringBootApplication++`` and ``++@ServletComponentScan++`` are used on a class belonging to the default package
* ``++@ComponentScan++`` is explicitly configured with the default package


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

@SpringBootApplication // Noncompliant; RootBootApp is declared in the default package
public class RootBootApp {
...
}
----

----
@ComponentScan("")
public class Application {
...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
package hello;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

@SpringBootApplication // Compliant; RootBootApp belongs to the "hello" package
public class RootBootApp {
...
}
----
