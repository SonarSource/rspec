== Why is this an issue?

Changing an inherited member to ``++private++`` will not prevent access to the base class implementation.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++private++`` method in an unsealed type has a signature that is identical to a ``++public++`` method declared in a base type.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  public class Foo
  {
    public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
  }
  public class Bar:Foo
  {
    private void SomeMethod(int count) { } // Noncompliant
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  public class Foo
  {
    public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
  }
  public sealed class Bar : Foo
  {
    private void SomeMethod(int count) { }
  }
}
