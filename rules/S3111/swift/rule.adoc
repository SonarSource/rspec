Conditional compilation is generally recognized as a bad practice that is occasionally necessary when dealing with platform-specific code. As much as possible, code should be refactored to minimize or eliminate conditionally-compiled, platform-specific code because even when necessary and well-intentioned, such code segments can leave your codebase in a hopeless tangle.
