== Why is this an issue?

Calling ``++System.gc()++`` or ``++Runtime.getRuntime().gc()++`` is a bad idea for a simple reason: there is no way to know exactly what will be done under the hood by the JVM because the behavior will depend on its vendor, version and options:

* Will the whole application be frozen during the call?
* Is the ``++-XX:DisableExplicitGC++`` option activated?
* Will the JVM simply ignore the call?
* ...

Like for ``++System.gc()++``, there is no reason to manually call ``++runFinalization()++`` to force the call of finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.


An application relying on these unpredictable methods is also unpredictable and therefore broken. The task of running the garbage collector and calling ``++finalize()++`` methods should be left exclusively to the JVM.
