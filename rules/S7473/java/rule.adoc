== Why is this an issue?

Unused variables in pattern matching can make the code harder to understand and cause confusion.
This may lead to potential errors.

For example, the variable that is declared but not used, may be mistakenly assumed to have significance in the code.
This can lead to misunderstandings and make the code less readable.

== How to fix it

Replace unused variables with the unnamed variable `_`.
This will not change the behavior of the program, but it will reduce clutter and make the code clearer.

=== Exceptions

Unnamed variables are only available since Java 22, so the rule ignores projects configured with earlier
Java versions.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public void foo(Ball ball){
 switch (ball) {
   case RedBall   red   -> process(ball);    // Noncompliant, Use _ instead
   case BlueBall  blue  -> process(ball);    // Noncompliant, Use _ instead
   case GreenBall green -> stopProcessing(); // Noncompliant, Use _ instead
 }
 if (r instanceof ColoredPoint(Point(int x, int y), Color c)) { // Noncompliant, Use _ instead
   System.out.println("x: " + x);
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public void foo(Ball ball){
 switch (ball) {
   case RedBall   _    -> process(ball);      // Compliant, unused variable has been replaced with _
   case BlueBall  blue -> processColor(blue); // Compliant, variable blue is used
   case GreenBall _    -> stopProcessing();   // Compliant
 }
 if (r instanceof ColoredPoint(Point(int x, _), _)) {  // Compliant, no unused named variables
   System.out.println("x: " + x);
  }
}
