Preprocessing directives (lines that start with ``++#++``) can be used to conditionally include or exclude code from compilation. Malformed preprocessing directives could lead to the exclusion or inclusion of more code than was intended. Therefore all preprocessing directives should be syntactically meaningful.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#define AAA 2
...
int foo(void)
{
  int x = 0;
  ...

#ifndef AAA
  x = 1;
#else1  /* Noncompliant */
  x = AAA;
#endif

  ...
  return x;
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
#define AAA 2
...
int foo(void)
{
  int x = 0;
  ...

#ifndef AAA
  x = 1;
#else
  x = AAA;
#endif

  ...
  return x;
}
----


== See

* MISRA C:2004, 19.16 - Preprocessing directives shall be syntactically meaningful even when excluded by preprocessor.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 16-0-8 - If the # token appears as the first token on a line, then it shall be immediately followed by a preprocessing token.
* MISRA C:2012, 20.13 - A line whose first token is # shall be a valid preprocessing directive
