== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

Character ranges can also create duplicates when used with character class escapes. These are a type of escape sequence used in regular expressions to represent a specific set of characters. They are denoted by a backslash followed by a specific letter, such as `++\d++` for digits, `++\w++` for word characters, or `++\s++` for whitespace characters. For example, the character class escape `++\d++` is equivalent to the character range `++[0-9]++`, and the escape `++\w++` is equivalent to `++[a-zA-Z0-9_]++`.

== How to fix it

Remove the extra character, character range, or character class escape.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
/[0-99]/ // Noncompliant, this won't actually match strings with two digits
/[0-9.-_]/ // Noncompliant, .-_ is a range that already contains 0-9 (as well as various other characters such as capital letters)
/[a-z0-9\d]/ // Noncompliant, \d matches a digit and is equivalent to [0-9]
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
/[0-9]{1,2}/
/[0-9.\-_]/
/[a-z\d]/
----
