``null`` and ``undefined`` are similar but not synonymous concepts in Javascript. Use a "hard" test (``===`` or ``!==``) for one, and you'll miss the other. Soft tests (``==``, and ``!=``) on the other hand, will pick up both non-values, as well as empty string.

Even if you mean to make the distinction in your code between ``null`` and ``undefined``, doing so is an extremely questionable practice that is likely to confuse both users and maintainers. Instead, use one or the other and test for both using soft tests.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function func1(p1, p2) {

  if (p1 === null) {  // Noncompliant 
    return;
  }
  if (p1 === undefined) { // Noncompliant
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
function func1(p1, p2) {

  if (p1 == null) {  // true for null, undefined
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
----
