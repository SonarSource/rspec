Ownership of an executable has been assigned to a user other than root. More
often than not, resource owners have write permissions and thus can edit the
resource.

Write permissions enable malicious actors, who got a foothold on the container,
to tamper with the executable and thus manipulate the container's expected behavior. +
Manipulating executables could disrupt services or aid in escalating privileges
inside the container. +

This breaches the container immutability principle as it facilitates container
changes during its life. Immutability, a container best practice, allows for a
more reliable and reproducible behavior of Docker containers.

Resource ownership is not required; executables can be assigned execute
permissions using `chmod` if needed.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* A non-root user has write permissions for the executable.

There is a risk if you answered yes to the question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use `--chmod` to change executable permissions at build-time.
* Be mindful of the container immutability principle.


== Sensitive Code Example

[source,docker]
----
FROM example

RUN useradd exampleuser
# Sensitive
COPY --chown=exampleuser:exampleuser src.py dst.py
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,docker]
----
FROM example

COPY src.py dst.py
----

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

Make sure no write permissions are assigned to the executable.


=== Highlighting

Highlight the executable name as primary location and the chown flag/command as secondary location.
