Ownership or write permissions for a file or directory copied to the Docker image have been assigned to a user other than root.

Write permissions enable malicious actors, who have a foothold on the container,
to tamper with the resource and thus potentially manipulate the container's expected behavior. +
Manipulating files could disrupt services or aid in escalating privileges inside the container. +

This also breaches the container immutability principle as it facilitates container
changes during its life. Immutability, a container best practice, allows for a
more reliable and reproducible behavior of Docker containers.

If a user is given ownership on a file but no write permissions, the user can still modify it by using his ownership to change the file permissions first. This is why both ownership and write permissions should be avoided.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* A non-root user has write permissions or ownership for the resource.

There is a risk if you answered yes to the question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use `--chmod` to change permissions at build-time.
* Be mindful of the container immutability principle.


== Sensitive Code Example

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
FROM example

RUN useradd exampleuser
# Sensitive
COPY --chown=exampleuser:exampleuser src.py dst.py
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
FROM example

COPY --chown=root:root --chmod=644 src.py dst.py
----

== Implementation Specification

=== Message

Make sure no write permissions are assigned to the copied resource.


=== Highlighting

Highlight the name of the copied resource as primary location and the chown flag/command as secondary location.
