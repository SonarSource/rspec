Ownership of an executable has been assigned to a user other than root. +
This breaches the container immutability principle. Immutability allows reliable behavior of the Docker container.

Giving ownership of executables enables malicious actors, who got a foothold on the container, to tamper with these and thus manipulate the container expected behavior. +
Executable manipulation could disrupt services or aid in escalating privileges inside the container.

Resource ownership is not required; if needed, executables can be assigned execute permissions using `chmod`.
