Ownership of an executable has been assigned to a user other than root. More
often than not, resource owners have write permissions and thus can edit the
resource.

Write permissions enable malicious actors, who got a foothold on the container,
to tamper with the executable and thus manipulate the container's expected behavior. +
Manipulating executables could disrupt services or aid in escalating privileges
inside the container. +

This breaches the container immutability principle as it facilitates container
changes during its life. Immutability, a container best practice, allows for a
more reliable and reproducible behavior of Docker containers.

Resource ownership is not required; executables can be assigned execute
permissions using `chmod` if needed.
