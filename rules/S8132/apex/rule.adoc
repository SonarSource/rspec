This rule raises an issue when values are converted to strings by concatenating them with empty strings (``++''++``).

== Why is this an issue?

Converting values to strings by concatenating them with empty strings is an inefficient and unclear practice.

When you write ``++'' + someValue++``, the Apex runtime must:

* Create a temporary string object for the empty string
* Convert ``++someValue++`` to its string representation
* Concatenate these two strings
* Return the result

This process involves unnecessary object creation and string manipulation overhead.

Using explicit ``++toString()++`` methods is more efficient because:

* It directly converts the value to a string without intermediate steps
* The intent is clearer to other developers reading your code
* It follows Apex best practices for type conversion

The performance difference becomes more noticeable when this pattern is used frequently, such as in loops or bulk operations common in Salesforce development.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue impacts code performance and maintainability:

* *Performance degradation*: Unnecessary object creation and string operations can slow down your code, especially in bulk operations
* *Reduced readability*: The intent to convert a value to string is less clear when using concatenation
* *Maintenance overhead*: Code reviewers and future developers may not immediately understand the purpose of empty string concatenation

== How to fix it

Replace empty string concatenation with the appropriate ``++toString()++`` method for the data type or use ``++String.valueOf()++``.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
String numberAsString = '' + 123; // Noncompliant
String decimalAsString = '' + 45.67; // Noncompliant
String booleanAsString = '' + true; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
String numberAsString = String.valueOf(123);
String decimalAsString = String.valueOf(45.67);
String booleanAsString = String.valueOf(true);
----
