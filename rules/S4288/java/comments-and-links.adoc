Spring 4.3 does not required the autowired annotation if there is only one constructor.  See the https://spring.io/blog/2016/03/04/core-container-refinements-in-spring-framework-4-3#implicit-constructor-injection-for-single-constructor-scenarios[blog post] announcing 4.3 for more details.


I would suggest that the compliant solution should look more like:


----
@Controller
public class HelloWorld {

  private final String name;

  public HelloWorld(String name) {
    this.name = name;
   // ...
  }

  // ...
} 
----

I believe that the dependancies should be `final`.
