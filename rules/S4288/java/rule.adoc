Spring ``++@Controller++``, ``++@Service++``, and ``++@Repository++`` classes are singletons by default, meaning only one instance of the class is ever instantiated in the application. Typically such a class might have a few ``++static++`` members, such as a logger, but all non-static members should be managed by Spring and supplied via constructor injection rather than by field injection.


This rule raise an issue when any non-``++static++`` member of a Spring component has an injection annotation.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
@Controller
public class HelloWorld {

  @Autowired
  private String name = null; // Noncompliant

}
----

== Compliant Solution

As of Spring 4.3
----
@Controller
public class HelloWorld {

  private String name = null;

  HelloWorld(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
----

Before Spring 4.3
----
@Controller
public class HelloWorld {

  private String name = null;

  @Autowired
  HelloWorld(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
