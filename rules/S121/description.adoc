Control structures are code statements that impact the program's control flow (e.g., if statements, for loops, etc.)

== Why is this an issue?

While not technically incorrect, the omission of curly braces can be misleading and may lead to the introduction of errors during maintenance.

include::{noncompliant}[]

Adding curly braces improves the code readability and its robustness:

include::{compliant}[]

The rule raises an issue when a control structure has no curly braces.
