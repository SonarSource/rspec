== Why is this an issue?

While not technically incorrect, the omission of ``++DO ... END++`` can be misleading and may lead to the introduction of errors during maintenance.

In the following example, the two commands seem to be attached to the `IF` statement, but only the first one is, and `put list ('42!')` will always be executed:

[source,pli]
----
foo: proc options(main);
  declare i fixed decimal init (0);

  if i = 42 then
    put list ('The answer is... '); /* Noncompliant */
    put list ('42!');
end;
----

Adding ``++DO ... END++`` improves the code readability and its robustness:

[source,pli]
----
foo: proc options(main);
  declare i fixed decimal init (0);

  if i = 42 then do;
    put list ('The answer is... ');
    put list ('42!');
  end;
end;
----

The rule raises an issue when "IF / ELSE" statements have no "DO ... END" structures.
