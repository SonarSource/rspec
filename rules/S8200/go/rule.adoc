This rule raises an issue when a struct variable is declared and then multiple fields are assigned individually in sequence, instead of using struct literal initialization syntax.

== Why is this an issue?

When initializing a struct with known values, using field-by-field assignment after declaration creates verbose and harder-to-maintain code.

Struct literal initialization offers several advantages:

* **Conciseness**: All field values are specified in one place, making the code more compact and readable.
* **Clarity**: The initialization intent is immediately clear, as all values are visible together.
* **Maintainability**: Adding, removing, or modifying fields is easier when all initialization happens in one location.
* **Error prevention**: Struct literals reduce the risk of forgetting to initialize a field or making assignment errors.
* **Go idioms**: Struct literal initialization is the idiomatic Go way to create and initialize structs with known values.

Field-by-field assignment is more appropriate when values are computed conditionally or come from different sources at different times.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using field-by-field assignment instead of struct literals makes code more verbose and harder to maintain. It increases the likelihood of initialization errors and makes the code less idiomatic in Go.

== How to fix it

Replace the struct declaration and field assignments with a struct literal that initializes all fields at once.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
func main() {
    var student Student
    student.name = "Leo"     // Noncompliant
    student.age = 21         // Noncompliant
    student.id = 121         // Noncompliant
    student.course = "CS"    // Noncompliant
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
func main() {
    student := Student{
        name:   "Leo",
        age:    21,
        id:     121,
        course: "CS",
    }
}
