The Java Language Specification recommends listing modifiers in the following order:


. Annotations
. public
. protected
. private
. abstract
. static
. final
. transient
. volatile
. synchronized
. native
. strictfp

Not following this convention has no technical impact, but will reduce the code's readability because most developers are used to the standard order.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
static public void main(String[] args) {   // Noncompliant
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----

}
