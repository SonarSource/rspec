== Why is this an issue?

When a cycle exists between classes during their ``++static++`` initialization, the results can be unpredictable because they depend on which class was initialized first.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class A {
  public static int a = B.b + 1;  // Noncompliant; sometimes a = 1, others a = 2
}

public class B {
  public static int b = A.a + 1;  // Noncompliant; sometimes b = 1, others b = 2
}
----
