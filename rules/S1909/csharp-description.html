<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use of <code>goto</code> can lead to programs that are extremely difficult to comprehend and analyse, and possibly to unspecified behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, removing <code>goto</code> from some code can lead to a rewritten version that is even more difficult to understand than the original. Therefore, limited use of <code>goto</code> is sometimes advised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the use of <code>goto</code> to jump into or out of a sub-block of code, such as into the body of a <code>for</code> loop is never acceptable, because it is extremely difficult to understand and will likely yield results other than what is intended.</p>
