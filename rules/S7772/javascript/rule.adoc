This rule raises an issue when Node.js built-in modules are imported without using the `node:` protocol prefix.

== Why is this an issue?

When importing Node.js built-in modules, using the `node:` protocol makes it explicitly clear that you're importing a core Node.js module rather than a third-party package from npm.

Without the `node:` prefix, it can be ambiguous whether `import fs from 'fs'` refers to the built-in file system module or a potential npm package named 'fs'. This ambiguity can lead to confusion, especially for developers who are new to a codebase or when reviewing code.

The `node:` protocol was introduced in Node.js 12.20.0 and became the recommended approach for importing built-in modules. It provides several benefits:

* **Clarity**: Makes it immediately obvious that the import refers to a Node.js built-in module
* **Security**: Prevents potential confusion attacks where malicious packages could have names similar to built-in modules
* **Future-proofing**: Aligns with Node.js best practices and ESM standards
* **Consistency**: Creates a uniform way to reference all built-in modules

This practice is particularly important in larger codebases where the distinction between built-in modules and external dependencies needs to be clear at a glance.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using imports without the `node:` protocol can lead to confusion about whether a module is built-in or external. In rare cases, this could create security vulnerabilities if malicious packages with names similar to built-in modules are installed. The lack of explicit protocol also makes code less self-documenting and harder to understand for new team members.

=== How to fix?


Add the `node:` prefix to ES6 import statements when importing Node.js built-in modules.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { createServer } from 'http'; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import { createServer } from 'node:http';
