== Why is this an issue?

Creating a new `Random` object each time a random value is needed is inefficient and may produce numbers that are not random, depending on
the JDK. For better efficiency and randomness, create a single `Random`, store it, and reuse it.

The `Random()` constructor tries to set the seed with a distinct value every time. However, there is no guarantee that the seed will be
randomly or uniformly distributed. Some JDK will use the current time as seed, making the generated numbers not random.

This rule finds cases where a new `Random` is created each time a method is invoked.

=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't apply to classes that use a `Random` in their constructors or the static `main` function and nowhere else.

== How to fix it

Define and reuse the `Random` object.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass {

    public void doSomethingCommon() {
      Random random = new Random();        // Noncompliant - new instance created with each invocation
      int rValue = random.nextInt();
    }
}
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass {
    private Random random = new Random();  // Compliant

    public void doSomethingCommon() {
      int rValue = this.random.nextInt();
    }
}
----

So this rule won't detect that your random object is initialized in an init method.


It might makes more sense to actually detect Random local variables.

\[~nicolas.peru] you mean local ``++Random++`` variables, right? :-)

(I did actually have to read that twice & note the capital letter to understand your meaning :-) )


I'd say that as written, this rule is about local ``++Random++``s (did you assign it back to me because you don't agree?), but I was hoping to be able to make it smarter. Oh well.

This RSPEC is for now limited to detecting local variables of type ``++java.util.Random++``.

It could later cover cases where the Random object is not even assigned:

----
(new Random()).nextInt()
