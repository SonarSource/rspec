The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring is used for automatic dependency injection.
It allows Spring to resolve and inject the required beans into your bean.
For example to inject a `@Repository` object into a `@Service`.

== Why is this an issue?

The Spring dependency injection mechanism cannot identify which constructor to use for auto-wiring when multiple constructors are present in a class.
This ambiguity can cause the application to crash at runtime, and it makes the code less clear to understand and more complex to extend and maintain.

=== What is the potential impact?

* *incorrect instantiation*: the wrong constructor is selected for instantiation, leading to a bean not being correctly initialized.

* *unsatisfied dependency exception*: the constructor selected by Spring requires beans that are not available in the Spring context.

* *non-deterministic behavior*: the constructor selected by Spring can vary, based on the number of dependencies that can be satisfied at runtime, leading to unpredictable application behavior.

* *maintainability issues*: adding more constructors in the future could lead to further confusion and potential bugs.

== How to fix it

Use the `@Autowired` annotation to specify which constructor to use for auto-wiring.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component
public class ExampleClass { // Noncompliant: multiple constructors present and no @Autowired annotation to specify which one to use

    private final DependencyClass1 dependency1;

    public ExampleClass() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Not supported yet.");
    }

    public ExampleClass(DependencyClass1 dependency1) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
    }

    // ...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component
public class ExampleClass {

    private final DependencyClass1 dependency1;

    public ExampleClass() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Not supported yet.");
    }

    @Autowired
    public ExampleClass(DependencyClass1 dependency1) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
    }

    // ...
}
----
