\[~tamas.vajk] the message is unusually long now. Also, I don't agree with raising issues on both collections; they're not parallel until there are 2 of them.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Shortened the message, WDYT?

The collections might not be this close next to each other, so I think it helps if all of them are marked symmetrically.

\[~ann.campbell.2] It's just to note that the following is okay:

----
var output = new List<int>();
for(int i = 0; i < input.Count; i++)
{
  output[i] = input[i]; // two collections are being indexed by the same variable, but it's compliant.
}
