Intent redirection vulnerabilities occur when an application publicly exposes a
component that uses an externally provided intent to start a new component.

In that case, an application running on the same device as the affected one can
summon the exposed, vulnerable component and provide it with a specially crafted
intent. Depending on the application's configuration and logic, this intent will
be used in the context of the vulnerable application, which poses a security
threat.
