=== What is the potential impact?

The vulnerable application context is used when a vulnerable application starts
a new component from a malicious externally provided intent. Notably, the
restrictions applied on accessible components are lower than when accessed from
an external application.

Therefore, an attacker exploiting an intent redirection vulnerability could
manage to access a private application's components. Depending on the features
privately exposed, this can lead to further exploitations, sensitive data
disclosure, or even persistent code execution.

==== Information disclosure

An attacker can access any non-publicly exposed component of the application.
This includes features that handle sensitive information, even if they are not
exported.

Therefore, by crafting a malicious intent and submitting it to the vulnerable
redirecting component, an attacker can retrieve most data exposed by private
features. This affects the confidentiality of information that is not
protected by an additional security mechanism, such as an encryption algorithm.

==== Attack surface increase

Because the attacker can access most components of the application, they can
identify and exploit other vulnerabilities that would be present in them. The
actual impact depends on the nested vulnerability. Exploitation probability
depends on the in-depth security level of the application.

==== Persistent code execution

A lot of applications rely on dynamic code loading to implement a variety of
features, such as:

* Minor feature updates.
* Application package size reduction.
* DRM or other code protection features.

When a component exposes a dynamic code loading feature, an attacker could use
it during the redirection's exploitation to deploy malicious code into the
application. The component can be located in the application itself or one of
its dependencies.

Such an attack would compromise the application execution environment entirely
and lead to multiple security threats. The malicious code could:

* Intercept and exfiltrate all data used in the application.
* Steal authentication credentials to third-party services.
* Change the application's behavior to serve another malicious purpose 
  (phishing, ransoming, etc) 

Note that in most cases, the deployed malware can persist application or
hosting device restarts.
