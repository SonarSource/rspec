In general, security best practices discourage forwarding intents. However, when
the application requires such a feature, it should precisely check the forwarded
intents to ensure they do not pass malicious content.

Additionally, the components that are not meant to be accessed externally should
be marked as non-exported in the application's manifest. This is done by setting
the `android:exported` attribute of the components to `"false"`.
