In general, security best practices discourage forwarding intents. However, when
the application requires such a feature it should precisely check forwarded
intents to ensure they do not pass malicious content.

Additionally, the components that are not meant to be accessed externally should
be marked as non-exported in the application's manifest. This is done with the
`android:exported="false"` attribute of a component.
