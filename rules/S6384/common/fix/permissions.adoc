==== Permissions downgrade

Before forwarding an intent to another component, the application can verify or
remove the permissions set on the forwarded intent. In that case, even if the
destination is a sensitive component, the application can ensure the untrusted
intent will not be able to read or write sensitive data or locations.

In most cases, the application should drop the following permissions from
untrusted intents:

* FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
* FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION
