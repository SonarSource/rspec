==== Checking the intent destination

Most unintended usage of the forwarding feature can be prevented by
verifying whether the destination package and class names belong to a list
of accepted components.

The allow-list of accepted destinations should only contain components that
perform non-sensitive actions and handle non-sensitive data. Moreover, it should
not allow reaching components that further redirect inner intents.
