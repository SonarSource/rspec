==== Checking the intent destination

Before forwarding the intent, the application should check its destination.
Verifying the destination package and class names belong to a list
of accepted components can prevent most unintended use of the forwarding
feature.

The allow-list of accepted destinations should only contain components that
perform non-sensitive actions and handle non-sensitive data. Moreover, it should
not allow reaching components that further redirect inner intents.
