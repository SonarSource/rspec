<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If attackers gain access to Atlassian API tokens or OAuth credentials, they will be able to interact with Atlassian product APIs on behalf of the compromised account. This includes products such as Jira, Confluence, or BitBucket.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_source_code">Compromise of sensitive source code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The affected service is used to store private packages and repositories. If a token is leaked, it can be used by unauthorized individuals to gain access to your sensitive code, proprietary libraries, and other confidential resources. This can lead to intellectual property theft, unauthorized modifications, or even sabotage of your software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these private packages contain other secrets, it might even lead to further breaches in the organization&#8217;s services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_supply_chain_attacks">Supply chain attacks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the leaked secret gives an attacker the ability to publish code to private packages or repositories under the name of the organization, then there may exist grave consequences beyond the compromise of source code. The attacker may inject malware, backdoors, or other harmful code into these private repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can cause further security breaches inside the organization, but will also affect clients if the malicious code gets added to any products. Distributing code that (unintentionally) contains backdoors or malware can lead to widespread security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_data">Compromise of sensitive data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the affected service is used to store or process personally identifiable
information or other sensitive data, attackers knowing an authentication secret
could be able to access it. Depending on the type of data that is compromised,
it could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or other
negative outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a
reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_modification_of_application_data">Modification of application data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications may rely on data that cannot be distributed with the application
code. This may be due to the size of the data, or because the data is regularly
updated. This data is downloaded by the application as it is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an attacker can gain access to an authentication secret, they may be able to
alter or delete this application data. This may cause parts of the application
to misbehave or stop working. Maliciously altered data could also contain
undesirable content which results in reputational damage.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_reducing_the_permission_scope_per_secret">Reducing the permission scope per secret</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By reducing the permission scope, the token is granted only the minimum set of permissions required to perform its intended tasks. This follows the principle of least privilege, which states that a user or token should have only the necessary privileges to carry out its specific functions. By adhering to this principle, the potential attack surface is minimized, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, if a token is compromised, the reduced permissions scope limits the potential damage that can be done. With fewer permissions, the attacker&#8217;s ability to access or modify critical resources is restricted, reducing the impact of the compromise.</p>
