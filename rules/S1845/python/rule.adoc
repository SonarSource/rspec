This rule raises an issue when there is a method and a field in a ``++class++`` that differ only by capitalization.

== Why is this an issue?

Looking at the set of methods and fields in a ``++class++`` and finding two that differ only by capitalization is confusing to users of the class.

This situation may simply indicate poor naming. Method names should be action-oriented, and thus contain a verb, which is unlikely in the case where both a method and a field have the same name (with or without capitalization differences). However, renaming a public method could be disruptive to callers. Therefore renaming the member is the recommended action.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class SomeClass:
    lookUp = false
    def lookup():       # Non-compliant; method name differs from field name only by capitalization
        pass
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class SomeClass:
    lookUp = false
    def getLookUp():
        pass
