<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking at the set of methods in a class, including superclass methods, and finding two methods or fields that differ only by capitalization is confusing to users of the class. It is similarly confusing to have a method and a field which differ only in capitalization or a method and a field with exactly the same name and visibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of methods, it may have been a mistake on the part of the original developer, who intended to override a superclass method, but instead added a new method with nearly the same name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, this situation simply indicates poor naming. Method names should be action-oriented, and thus contain a verb, which is unlikely in the case where both a method and a member have the same name (with or without capitalization differences). However, renaming a public method could be disruptive to callers. Therefore renaming the member is the recommended action.</p>

<p>[test-code-support-investigation-for-java] Decision for scope: Keep 'Main'. Wwe should exclude the case where method and variable have same name and we return the name. if this is already the case we have an FP with method defined in interface and then implemented in the class. Other case instead of returning an atomicLong, we return a long (AtomicLong foo=&#8230;&#8203;; long foo(){&#8230;&#8203;}) also may have problem with project that use all capitalized and all lowecase as convention in their projects to mean something specific"</p>
