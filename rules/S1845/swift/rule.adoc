This rule raises an issue when there is a method and a field in a ``++class++``, ``++struct++``, ``++enum++``, or ``++extension++`` that differ only by capitalization.

== Why is this an issue?

Looking at the set of methods in a ``++class++``, ``++struct++``, ``++enum++``, or ``++extension++`` and finding two methods that differ only by capitalization is confusing to users of the class. It is similarly confusing to have a method and a field or a case which differ only in capitalization.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class SomeClass {
    var lookUp = false
    func lookup(){ }        // Noncompliant; method name differs from field name only by capitalization
    func lookUP(){ }        // Noncompliant; method name differs from field and another method name only by capitalization
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class SomeClass {
    var lookUp = false
    func getLookUp(){ }
}
