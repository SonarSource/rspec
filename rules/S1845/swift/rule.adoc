== Why is this an issue?

Looking at the set of methods in a ``++class++``, ``++struct++``, ``++enum++``, or ``++extension++`` and finding two methods that differ only by capitalization is confusing to users of the class. It is similarly confusing to have a method and a field or a case which differ only in capitalization.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
class SomeClass {
    var lookUp = false
    func lookup(){ }        // Noncompliant; method name differs from field name only by capitalization
    func lookUP(){ }        // Noncompliant; method name differs from field and another method name only by capitalization
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,swift]
----
class SomeClass {
    var lookUp = false
    func getLookUp(){ }
}
----
