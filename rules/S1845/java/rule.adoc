[test-code-support-investigation-for-java] Decision for scope: Keep 'Main'. Wwe should exclude the case where method and variable have same name and we return the name. if this is already the case we have an FP with method defined in interface and then implemented in the class. Other case instead of returning an atomicLong, we return a long (AtomicLong foo=...; long foo(){...}) also may have problem with project that use all capitalized and all lowecase as convention in their projects to mean something specific"
