== Why is this an issue?

Overriding the Object.finalize() method should be done with caution and with a clear goal in mind so empty implementations or implementations containing only a call to 'super.finalize()' are useless and misleading. 


The following code snippet illustrates this rule:

----
protected finalize() {    //Non-Compliant
}
...
protected finalize() {
  super.finalize();          //Non-Compliant
}
...
protected finalize() {
  disposeSomeResources();     //Compliant
}
----
