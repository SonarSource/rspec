Making a ``public`` constant just ``final`` as opposed to ``static final`` leads to duplicating its value for every instance of the class, uselessly increasing the amount of memory required to execute the application.

Further, when a non-``public``, ``final``  field isn't also ``static``, it implies that different instances can have different values. However, initializing a non-``static final`` field in its declaration forces every instance to have the same value. So such fields should either be made ``static`` or initialized in the constructor.
