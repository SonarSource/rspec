== Why is this an issue?

A ``++LocalConnection++`` object is used to invoke a method in another ``++LocalConnection++`` object, either within a single SWF file or between multiple SWF files. This kind of local connection should be authorized only when the origin (domain) of the other Flex applications is perfectly defined. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,flex]
----
localConnection.allowDomain("*");
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,flex]
----
localConnection.allowDomain("www.myDomain.com");
----
