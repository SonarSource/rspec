== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Avoid constructing system commands from user input when possible.
* Ensure that no risky arguments can be injected for the given program, e.g., type-cast the argument to an integer.
* Use a more secure interface to communicate with other programs, e.g., the standard input stream (stdin).
