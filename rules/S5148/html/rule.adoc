== Sensitive Code Example

[source,html]
----
<a href="http://example.com/" rel="opener" target="_blank"> <!-- Sensitive -->

<a href="{{variable}}" rel="opener" target="_blank"> <!-- Sensitive -->
----

== Compliant Solution

In Chrome 88+, Firefox 79+ or Safari 12.1+ ``++target=_blank++`` on anchors implies ``++rel=noopener++`` which makes the protection enabled by default.

[source,html]
----
<a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank" >
----

== Exceptions

No Issue will be raised when ``++href++`` contains a hardcoded relative url as there it has less chances of being vulnerable. An url is considered hardcoded and relative if it doesn't start with ``++http://++`` or ``++https://++``, and if it does not contain any of the characters {}$()[]
