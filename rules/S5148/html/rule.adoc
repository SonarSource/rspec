== Sensitive Code Example

----
<a href="http://example.com/dangerous" target="_blank"> <!-- Sensitive -->

<a href="{{variable}}" target="_blank"> <!-- Sensitive -->
----

== Compliant Solution

To prevent pages from abusing ``++window.opener++``, use ``++rel=noopener++`` on ``++<a href=>++`` to force its value to be ``++null++`` on the opened pages.

[source,html]
----
<a href="http://petssocialnetwork.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <!-- Compliant -->
----

== Exceptions

No Issue will be raised when ``++href++`` contains a hardcoded relative url as there it has less chances of being vulnerable. An url is considered hardcoded and relative if it doesn't start with ``++http://++`` or ``++https://++``, and if it does not contain any of the characters {}$()[]
