== Why is this an issue?

The debugger statement can be placed anywhere in procedures to suspend execution. Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code. By definition such statement must absolutely be removed from the source code to prevent any unexpected behavior or added vulnerability to attacks in production.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
for (i = 1; i<5; i++) {
  // Print i to the Output window.
  Debug.write("loop index is " + i);
  // Wait for user to resume.
  debugger;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
for (i = 1; i<5; i++) {
  // Print i to the Output window.
  Debug.write("loop index is " + i);
}
