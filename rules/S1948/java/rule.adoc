== Why is this an issue?

Fields in a ``++Serializable++`` class must themselves be either ``++Serializable++`` or ``++transient++`` even if the class is never explicitly serialized or deserialized. For instance, under load, most J2EE application frameworks flush objects to disk, and an allegedly ``++Serializable++`` object with non-transient, non-serializable data members could cause program crashes, and open the door to attackers. In general a ``++Serializable++`` class is expected to fulfil its contract and not have an unexpected behaviour when an instance is serialized. 


This rule raises an issue on non-``++Serializable++`` fields, and on collection fields when they are not ``++private++`` (because they could be assigned non-``++Serializable++`` values externally), and when they are assigned non-``++Serializable++`` types within the class.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class Address {
  //...
}

public class Person implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1905122041950251207L;

  private String name;
  private Address address;  // Noncompliant; Address isn't serializable
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public class Address implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 2405172041950251807L;
}

public class Person implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1905122041950251207L;

  private String name;
  private Address address;
}
----


=== Exceptions

The alternative to making all members ``++serializable++`` or ``++transient++`` is to implement special methods which take on the responsibility of properly serializing and de-serializing the object. This rule ignores classes which implement the following methods:


[source,java]
----
 private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out)
     throws IOException
 private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)
     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
----
