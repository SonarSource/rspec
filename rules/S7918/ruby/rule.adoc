This rule raises an issue when a module uses `module_function` to create module-level methods.

== Why is this an issue?

Using `module_function` in Ruby modules can make the code's intent less clear compared to `extend self`.

When you want to create a module with methods that can be called directly on the module itself, Ruby provides two main approaches: `module_function` and `extend self`. While both work, they have different behaviors and implications.

`module_function` creates both private instance methods and public module methods. This dual nature can be confusing because it suggests the module might be included in classes, when often the intent is just to have module-level utility methods.

`extend self` is more explicit about the intent. It clearly states that the module is extending itself with its own instance methods, making them available as module methods. This approach is more straightforward when all methods in the module should be callable at the module level.

The `extend self` approach is also more consistent with Ruby's object model and is recommended by major style guides, including Shopify's Ruby Style Guide.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `module_function` instead of `extend self` reduces code clarity and can make the module's intended usage less obvious to other developers. While functionally equivalent in many cases, `extend self` better communicates the intent when creating utility modules with module-level methods.

== How to fix it

Replace `module_function` with `extend self` at the beginning of the module. This makes the intent clearer and follows Ruby style guide recommendations.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
module SomeModule
  module_function # Noncompliant

  def some_method
    "Hello from module method"
  end

  def another_method
    "Another module method"
  end
end
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
module SomeModule
  extend self

  def some_method
    "Hello from module method"
  end

  def another_method
    "Another module method"
  end
end
