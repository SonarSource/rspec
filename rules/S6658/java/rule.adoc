Classes that serve as central dependencies to a great number of other components are hard to maintain.

== Why is this an issue?

Highly connected classes become more difficult to modify as their number of incoming connections increases.
Modifying method signatures, field names or visibility levels requires changes across numerous components and files.

//=== What is the potential impact?

== How to fix it

The first option is to move some of the logic from the connected components to the central one to reduce the number of connections.

If this is not a possibility, proceed to maintain this component using the open/closed principle to limit the impact radius of changes.
