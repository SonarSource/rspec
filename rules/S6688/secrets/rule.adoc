=== What is the potential impact?

A Facebook application secret key is a unique authentication token assigned to a
Facebook application. It is used to authenticate and authorize the application
to access Facebook's APIs and services. This key is required to perform actions
on Facebook API, such as retrieving user data, posting on behalf of users, or
accessing various Facebook features.

If a Facebook application secret key leaks to an unintended audience, it can
have serious security-related consequences both for the associated Facebook
application and its users. Especially, attackers knowing an application's secret
key will be able to access users' data that the application has been granted
access to.

This can represent a severe confidentiality loss for Personally Identifiable
Information. This might be against national regulatory requirements in some
countries.
