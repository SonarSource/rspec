=== What is the potential impact?

A Facebook application secret key is a unique authentication token assigned to
a Facebook application. It is used to authenticate and authorize the
application to access Facebook's APIs and services, such as:

* retrieving user data
* posting on behalf of users
* accessing various Facebook features

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
