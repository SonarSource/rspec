==== Thymeleaf's Built-in Security Measures

It is worth noting that since Thymeleaf version 3.0.12, expressions are executed in a sandboxed environment where only a limited set of classes and methods are available. While this might make it harder to exploit SSTI vulnerabilities, it does not make it impossible and there might be unknown bypasses which could still allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
