== Why is this an issue?

Server-side template injections occur in an application when the application
retrieves data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it into a
template, without sanitizing it first.

If an application contains a template that is vulnerable to injections, 
it is exposed to attacks that target the underlying rendering server.

A user with malicious intent carefully performs actions whose goal is to cause
the template to change its logic into a malicious one.

After creating the malicious request, the attacker can attack the servers
affected by this vulnerability without relying on any prerequisites.

=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker exploiting a server-side template injection vulnerability will be
able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

The impact depends on the access control measures taken on the target system
OS. In the worst-case scenario, the process runs with root privileges, and
therefore any OS commands or programs may be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Denial of service and data leaks

In this scenario, the attack aims to disrupt the organization's activities and
profit from data leaks.

An attacker could, for example:

* download the internal server's data, most likely to sell it
* modify data, send malware
* stop services or exhaust resources (with fork bombs for example)

This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).

==== Root privilege escalation and pivot

In this scenario, the attacker can do everything described in the previous
section. The difference is that the attacker also manages to elevate their
privileges to an administrative level and attacks other servers.

Here, the impact depends on how much the target company focuses on its Defense
In Depth. For example, the entire infrastructure can be compromised by a
combination of OS injections and *misconfiguration* of:

* Docker or Kubernetes clusters
* cloud services
* network firewalls and routing
* OS access control


== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

The following code is vulnerable to server-side template injection because it
is inserting untrusted inputs into a string that is then processed for
rendering. +
This vulnerability arises because the rendering function does not validate the
input, allowing attackers to potentially inject malicious Python code for
execution.

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from flask import request, render_template_string

@app.route('/example')
def example():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    template = f"<p>Hello {username}</p>"
    return render_template_string(template) # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
from flask import request, render_template_string

@app.route('/example')
def example():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    template = "<p>Hello {{ username }}</p>"
    return render_template_string(template, username=username)
----

=== How does this work?

=== Use template variables

The universal method to prevent path injection is to sanitize untrusted data.
Manual sanitization is error-prone, so it is best to automate the process.

Here, `render_template_string` automatically sanitizes template variables by
escaping them. This means that any untrusted data will not be able to break out
of the initially intended template logic.
