Server-side template injections occur in an application when the application
retrieves data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it into a
template, without sanitizing it first.

If an application contains a template that is vulnerable to injections, 
it is exposed to attacks that target the underlying rendering server.

A user with malicious intent can create requests that will cause
the template to change its logic into unwanted behavior.

After creating the malicious request, the attacker can attack the servers
affected by this vulnerability without relying on any prerequisites.
