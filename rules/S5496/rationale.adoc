Server-side template injections occur when an application
retrieves data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it into a
template, without sanitizing it first.

If an application contains a template that is vulnerable to injections, 
it is exposed to attacks that target the underlying rendering server.

A user with malicious intent can create requests that will cause
the template to change its logic into unwanted behavior.
