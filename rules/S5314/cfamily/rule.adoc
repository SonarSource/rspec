Blocking functions should not be called inside critical sections

== Why is this an issue?

Concurrent accesses to shared resources are guarded by synchronization
primitives such as mutexes to prevent data races. The section of code
where a mutex is held is called the critical section. Critical sections
are generally designed to be as small as possible, allowing concurrent
threads to progress.

It's usually unintentional to perform blocking operations inside a
critical section because the operation might block for long or even
indefinitely, degrading performance or causing a deadlock.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <cstdio>    // printf()
#include <cstdlib>   // atoi()
#include <mutex>
#include <unistd.h>  // sleep()

std::mutex m;
int load_shared_resource(); // Guarded by mutex 'm'

// Some time-intensive computation.
void do_expensive_work(int value, FILE *fd) {
  char buf[4] = "";
  std::fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), fd);
  int sum = value + std::atoi(buf);
  std::printf("value + line: %d\n", sum);
}

void worker_thread(FILE *fd) {
  std::scoped_lock guard(m);
  int value = load_shared_resource();
  // Mutex 'm' could have been released here.
  do_expensive_work(value, fd);
} // Mutex 'm' only released here, after 'do_expensive_work' is returned.
----

Usually, blocking operations involve I/O operations, such as reading or
writing a file or socket or sleeping for some specified time.

=== What is the potential impact?

Doing time-intensive operations while holding one or multiple locks will
prevent concurrent threads from making progress updating the shared resource.
This can lead to "bottlenecks" and the under-utilization of the hardware
capabilities.

== How to fix it

Usually, one can move blocking or expensive computations from critical sections.
This leads to smaller and cleaner critical sections in general,

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <unistd.h>  // sleep()
#include <mutex>
#include <algorithm>

int magic_number;
std::mutex m;

void consumer_thread() {
  int current;
  for (int items_processed = 0; items_processed < 100; ++items_processed) {
    std::scoped_lock guard(m);
    current = magic_number;

    sleep(std::clamp(current, 0, 10)); // Noncompliant: 'sleep' blocks while holding mutext 'm'
  }
}
----

[source,c,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <unistd.h>  // sleep()
#include <pthread.h> // pthread_mutex_*()

int magic_number;
pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void consumer_thread() {
  int current;
  for (int items_processed = 0; items_processed < 100; ++items_processed) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    current = magic_number;
    // Could have 'unlocked' mutex 'm' here.
    sleep(current); // Noncompliant: 'sleep' blocks while holding mutex 'm'
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <unistd.h>  // sleep()
#include <mutex>
#include <algorithm>

int magic_number;
std::mutex m;

void consumer_thread() {
  int current;
  for (int items_processed = 0; items_processed < 100; ++items_processed) {
    {
      std::scoped_lock guard(m);
      current = magic_number;
    }

    sleep(std::clamp(current, 0, 10)); // Ok, blocking without holding any mutexes.
  }
}
----

[source,c,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <unistd.h>  // sleep()
#include <pthread.h> // pthread_mutex_*()

int magic_number;
pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void consumer_thread() {
  int current;
  for (int items_processed = 0; items_processed < 100; ++items_processed) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    current = magic_number;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
    sleep(current); // Ok, blocking without holding any mutexes.
  }
}
----

=== Pitfalls

It's important to note that not all operations can be moved out from the
critical section without redesigning the algorithm.
It's tempting to read, compute and commit back the result to some shared
resource, but that coding pattern is vulnerable to
Time-Of-Check-To-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) bugs.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <unistd.h>  // sleep()
#include <mutex>

int input;
std::mutex input_mutex;

int output;
std::mutex output_mutex;

int expensive_computation(int in);

void worker_thread() {
  int previous_input = -1;
  int previous_result = -1;

  for (int items_processed = 0; items_processed < 100; ++items_processed) {
    int current;
    {
      // Read an input.
      std::scoped_lock guard(input_mutex);
      current = input;
    }

    // Potentially perform an expensive computation.
    // The 'input' might have changed during the computation,
    // in which case, we just drop the result without committing it.
    if (current != previous_input) {
      previous_input = current;
      previous_result = expensive_computation(current);

      // Verify that the 'input' didn't change, and we can commit our result.
      std::scoped_lock in_guard(input_mutex);
      if (input == previous_input) {
        std::scoped_lock out_guard(output_mutex);
        output = previous_result; // Commit the result.
      }
    }
  }
}
----

It might not always be correct to commit the result even if the `input`
didn't change since we last checked. It could be that it was changed
but restored, as we are rechecking it. This is commonly known as
the ABA problem, where `A` and `B` refers to the values of the resource.
