== Why is this an issue?

Character classes in regular expressions allow you to define sets of characters for matching, for example `[abc]` will match `a`, `b` or `c`. 

[source,javascript]
----
/^foo[]/.test(str); // Noncompliant, always returns "false"
----

An empty character class (`[]`) will not match any character because the set of matching characters is empty. So the regular expression will not work as you intended.
