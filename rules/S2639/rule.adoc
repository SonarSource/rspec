== Why is this an issue?

Regular expressions are powerful but tricky, and even those long used to using them can make mistakes.


The following should not be used as regular expressions:

* ``++.++`` - matches any single character. Used in ``++replaceAll++``, it matches _everything_
* ``++|++`` - normally used as an option delimiter. Used stand-alone, it matches the space between characters
* ``++File.separator++`` - matches the platform-specific file path delimiter. On Windows, this will be taken as an escape character
* ``++[]++`` - empty character class doesn't match anything


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
String str = "/File|Name.txt";

String clean = str.replaceAll(".",""); // Noncompliant; probably meant to remove only dot chars, but returns an empty string
String clean2 = str.replaceAll("|","_"); // Noncompliant; yields _/_F_i_l_e_|_N_a_m_e_._t_x_t_
String clean3 = str.replaceAll(File.separator,""); // Noncompliant; exception on Windows
