== Why is this an issue?

Regular expressions are powerful but tricky. Even experienced users can make mistakes.

The following should not be used as regular expressions:

* ``++.++`` - matches any single character. Used in ``++replaceAll++``, it matches _everything_
* ``++|++`` - normally used as an option delimiter. Used stand-alone, it matches the space between characters
* ``++File.separator++`` - matches the platform-specific file path delimiter. On Windows, this will be taken as an escape character
* ``++[]++`` - empty character class doesn't match anything


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
String str = "/File|Name.txt";

String clean = str.replaceAll(".",""); // Noncompliant; probably meant to remove only dot chars, but returns an empty string
String clean2 = str.replaceAll("|","_"); // Noncompliant; yields _/_F_i_l_e_|_N_a_m_e_._t_x_t_
String clean3 = str.replaceAll(File.separator,""); // Noncompliant; exception on Windows
