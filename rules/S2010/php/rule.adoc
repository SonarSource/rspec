== Why is this an issue?

PHP has two sets of logical operators: ``++&&++`` / ``++||++``, and ``++and++`` / ``++or++``. The difference between the sets is precedence. Because ``++and++`` / ``++or++`` have a lower precedence than almost any other operator, using them instead of ``++&&++`` / ``++||++`` may not have the result you expect.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
$have_time = true;
$have_money = false;
$take_vacation = $have_time and $have_money;  // Noncompliant. $take_vacation == true.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
$have_time = true;
$have_money = false;
$take_vacation = $have_time && $have_money;  // $take_vacation == false.
