A `final` or `const` variable that is declared as a nullable type, but then initialized with a non-null value, should rather be declared as a non-nullable type.

== Why is this an issue?

Unlike `var` variables, `final` and `const` variables need to be initialized inline.

[source,dart]
----
final int i = 42;
const int i = 42;
----

An exception to the inline initialization is when the https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety#late-variables[`late` keyword] is used, which allows the variable to be initialized later, and that can only apply to non-`const` variables:

[source,dart]
----
late final int i1;
late int? i2; 

void main() {
  // ...
  i1 = int.parse(String.fromEnvironment('I1'));
  i2 = int.parse(String.fromEnvironment('I2'));
  // Use i
}
----

Aforementioned exceptions apart, if:

* the declared type is explicit (e.g. `final int?` or `const int?`)
* the declared type is a nullable type (e.g. `int?`)
* the inline initialization value is not null (e.g. `42`)

then the declared type could be non-nullable instead, because the value of the variable will never be `null` under any circumstances, due to the `final` or `const` constaints imposed.

The rule applies to:

* local variables of functions and methods
* top-level variables

=== What is the potential impact?

Because Dart 3 enforces https://dart.dev/null-safety#dart-3-and-null-safety[sound null safety], not following this rule may have multiple consequences.

==== Code complexity

It may make the code *unnecessarily complicated*, as the developer will have to handle the `null` case even though it will never happen: for example, if the variable `t` is of type `T?`, any operation `f` on `t` will have to:

* either use the null-aware operator `?.`: e.g. `t?.f()`
* or the null assertion operator `!` on `t`: e.g. `t!.f()`
* or narrow the type from `T?` to `T` with an `if` statement, a conditional expression, or via pattern matching: e.g. ``++t != null ? t.f() : ...++``

Neither of these options is necessary if the variable is declared as `final T` or `const T` instead.

==== Unclear intent

If the variable is declared as `final T?` or `const T?`, and used far from its declaration, the `?` can be misleading, since the developer may assume that the variable can be `null` at some point in its lifetime, even though it can't.

=== Exceptions

The rule does not apply to class instance fields, whether they are `late` or not.

[source,dart]
----
class A {
  final int? i = 42; // Non applicable
  A(this.a);
}
----

However, it does apply to class static fields:

[source,dart]
----
class A {
  static final int? i1 = 42; // Non compliant
  static const int? i2 = 42; // Non compliant
}
----

== How to fix it

Change the type of the variable to be non-nullable and remove all the null-safety measures potentially used at every call site, such as 

* the null-aware operator `?.`
* the null assertion operator `!`
* or any construct introduced to narrow the type

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
final int? i = 42; // Noncompliant
final String? s = 'Hello'; // Noncompliant

void main() {
  print(i!);
  print(s?.length);
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
final int i = 42;
final String s = 'Hello';

void main() {
  print(i);
  print(s.length);
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class AClass {
  static final int? i1 = 42; // Noncompliant
  static final String? s1 = 'Hello'; // Noncompliant

  static void aFunction() {
    final int? i2 = 42; // Noncompliant
    const int? i3 = 42; // Noncompliant

    print(i1!);
    print(s1?.length);
    print(i2 ?? 0);
    print(i3 != null ? i3 : '<no value>');
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
class AClass {
  static final int i1 = 42;
  static final String s1 = 'Hello';

  static void aFunction() {
    final int i2 = 42;
    const int i3 = 42;

    print(i1);
    print(s1.length);
    print(i2);
    print(i3);
  }
}
