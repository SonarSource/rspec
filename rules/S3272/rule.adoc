== Why is this an issue?

``++WebSocket++``s allow client-server communications in both directions simultaneously, but because of the way the protocol is designed, it's vulnerable to a number of attacks: 

* denial of service on both the client and server sides - because ``++WebSocket++``s are persistent connections, it is easier to exhaust this type of resource
* exposure of sensitive data - because ``++WebSocket++``s aren't encrypted the data sent over them is vulnerable to sniffing

Additionally ``++WebSocket++``s offer no particular protection from XSS attacks.


This rule raises an issue on each file in which ``++WebSocket++``s are used.
