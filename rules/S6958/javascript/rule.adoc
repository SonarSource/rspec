== Why is this an issue?

Calling a literal throws a TypeError, and is likely the result of an unintentional error in the code.

This rule raises an issue when an attempt is made to use a literal as a function.


[source,js]
----
true(); // Noncompliant, literal should not be used as function
----

This rule also detects when a literal is used as a _tag_ function.

[source,js]
----
true``; // Noncompliant, literal should not be used as tag function
----
