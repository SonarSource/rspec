This rule raises an issue when shell commands use short parameter notation (like `-rf`) instead of available long parameter notation (like `--recursive --force`).

== Why is this an issue?

Short parameter notation in shell scripts reduces readability and makes maintenance more difficult. When you see `-rf` in a script, you need to remember or look up what each flag means. This creates cognitive overhead and slows down code reviews.

Long parameter notation like `--recursive --force` is self-documenting. Anyone reading the script immediately understands what the command does, regardless of their familiarity with the specific command's options.

This becomes especially important for:

* Lesser-known commands where options aren't commonly memorized
* Scripts that will be maintained by multiple team members
* Commands with many possible flags where combinations can be confusing
* Code reviews where reviewers need to quickly understand the intent

While short flags are convenient for interactive command-line use, scripts are meant to be read and maintained over time. The extra verbosity of long flags pays dividends in clarity and reduces the chance of misunderstanding the script's behavior.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using short parameter notation makes shell scripts harder to read, understand, and maintain. This can lead to:

* Increased time spent deciphering what commands do during code reviews or debugging
* Higher risk of introducing bugs when modifying scripts due to misunderstanding flag meanings
* Reduced team productivity when working with unfamiliar scripts
* Greater barrier to entry for new team members or contributors

=== How to fix?


Replace short parameter notation with the equivalent long parameter notation. Most common Unix commands support both forms.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
rm -rf -- "${dir}" # Noncompliant
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz # Noncompliant
ls -la /tmp # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
rm --recursive --force -- "${dir}"
tar --extract --gzip --file archive.tar.gz
ls --long --all /tmp
