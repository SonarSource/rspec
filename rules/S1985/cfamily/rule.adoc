== Why is this an issue?

Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule checks that there are no whitespaces between an ``++@++`` character and what it precedes.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
@ interface // Noncompliant
@ end // Noncompliant

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
@interface
@end

@Ann, would be great to know if placing a whitespace after a "@" is tolerated by and only by the CLang compiler or if the language itself really allows to do that. According to the answer to this question, this might slightly impact the rule description.
