== Why is this an issue?

Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule checks that there are no whitespaces between an ``++@++`` character and what it precedes.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
@ interface // Noncompliant
@ end // Noncompliant

[source,cpp]
----
@interface
@end
