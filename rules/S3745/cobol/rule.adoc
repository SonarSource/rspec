COBOL programs that include ``++EXEC SQL INCLUDE++`` statements must be pre-processed with an IBM DB2 precompiler or coprocessor before compilation. The precompiler does not require a period after the closing ``++END-EXEC++``, but the coprocessor does. For portability, a period should always be used.


== Noncompliant Code Example

EXEC SQL INCLUDE ... END-EXEC  *> Noncompliant; '.' missing
