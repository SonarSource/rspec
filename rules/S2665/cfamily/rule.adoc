== Why is this an issue?

Although some compilers will allow it, the use of `sizeof` and `alignof` with arguments that have a `void` type is forbidden by both the C and {cpp} standards.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void fun() {
  void* p;
  sizeof(*p);  // Noncompliant
  sizeof(void);  // Noncompliant
  alignof(*p);  // Noncompliant
  alignof(void);  // Noncompliant
}
----

Don't use the "alignof" operator with an operand of a "void" type.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I suspect that [~freddy.mallet] misunderstood Cppcheck rule, so that correct example looks like:

{noformat}

void test() {

  void* p;

  sizeof(*p);

}

{noformat}

and in this case there is indeed no intersection with RSPEC-2215.

\[~ann.campbell.2] In fact I didn't found that C standard forbids this, whereas {cpp} standard indeed forbids. Also GCC warns about this in {cpp} mode and still compiles, and doesn't warn in C mode. This *GNU extension* is indeed most probably originated from GCC compiler, but exists in some others for compatibility reasons - for example behavior of ICC (Intel Compiler) is the same as GCC, whereas Clang rejects this in {cpp} mode, but accepts in C without any warnings. Also statement "gcc is not a conforming C compiler by default" sounds a bit strong and aggressive. Based on this I think that we should adjust description.

C11 6.5.3.4p1:

____
The sizeof operator shall not be applied to an expression that has function type or an incomplete type, to the parenthesized name of such a type, or to an expression that designates a bit-field member. The _Alignof operator shall not be applied to a function type or an incomplete type.

____
and C11 6.2.5p19:

____
The void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete object type that cannot be completed.

____
from where I conclude that indeed usage of "void" is not allowed by C11 standard.

And indeed - GCC 4.8.4 and Clang 3.6.0 would warn about this in "pedantic" C mode, but not ICC 15.0.2.


CPP11 5.3.3p1:

____
The sizeof operator shall not be applied to an expression that has function or incomplete type, ...

____
CPP11 5.3.6p1:

____
An alignof expression yields the alignment requirement of its operand type. The operand shall be a type-id representing a complete object type or an array thereof or a reference to a complete object type.

____
CPP11 3.9.1p9:

____
The void type is an incomplete type that cannot be completed.

____
So that not allowed by CPP11 too.

As was stated before - Clang will reject with error, GCC and ICC will show warning.


I hope this is enough to clarify description.

Also scope can be extended to cover "alignof" for which compilers behave in the same way as for "sizeof".
