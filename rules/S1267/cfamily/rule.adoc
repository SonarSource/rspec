== Why is this an issue?

----
dynamic_cast<PMobile*>(pObject)   //Ok
static_cast<PMobile*>(pObject)     //Ok
(PMobile*) pObject      //Violation
----

Compare to C-style cast, the new casts improve

precision of meaning and easy

recognizability. Programs that use the new casts are easier to parse (both for humans and for tools), and they allow compilers to diagnose casting errors that would otherwise go undetected.(Maintainability & Consistency).
