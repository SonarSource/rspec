== Why is this an issue?

Consistent naming of beans is important for the readability and maintainability of the code. More precisely, according to the Spring documentation:
----
Naming beans consistently makes your configuration easier to read and understand, and if you are using Spring AOP it helps a lot when applying advice to a set of beans related by name.
----

Not following accepted conventions can introduce inconsistent naming, especially when multiple developers work on the same project, leading to technical debt.

The spring documentation establishes a naming convention that consists of camel-cased names with a leading lowercase letter.

This rule raises an issue when a bean name defined in one of the following annotations does not adhere to the naming convention:

* `@Bean`
* `@Configuration`
* `@Controller`
* `@Component`
* `@Qualifier`
* `@Repository`
* `@Service`

== How to fix it

Change the bean's name to adhere to the naming conventions.
Names should be camel-cased and start with a lowercase letter, for example, `myBean`.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Bean(name = "MyBean") // Noncompliant, the first letter of the name should be lowercase
public MyBean myBean() {
    ...
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Bean(name = "myBean") // Compliant
public MyBean myBean() {
    ...
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Service("my_service") // Noncompliant, the name should be camel-cased
public class MyService {
    ...
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Service("myService") // Compliant
public class MyService {
    ...
----
