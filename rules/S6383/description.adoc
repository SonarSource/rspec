Disabling Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on Azure resources can reduce an
organization's ability to protect itself against access controls being compromised.

To be considered safe, access controls must follow the principle of
least privilege and correctly segregate duties amongst users.
RBAC helps enforce these practices by adapting the organization's access control
needs into explicit role-based policies: It helps keeping access controls maintainable
and sustainable.

Furthermore, RBAC allows operations teams to work faster during a security
incident. It helps to mitigate account theft or intrusions by quickly shutting down
accesses.
