== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to use DNSSEC when creating private and public DNS zones. Private DNS zones cannot be queried on the Internet and provide DNS name resolution for private networks. Private networks might be considered as trusted and may not immediately require DNSSEC. Note that when choosing a cryptographic DNSSEC algorithm (`default_key_specs.algorithm` argument) `rsasha1` should not be used as it's not anymore considered as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[secure algorithm].
