== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to use DNSSEC when creating private and public DNS zones. 

Private DNS zones cannot be queried on the Internet and provide DNS name resolution for private networks. The risk of MITM attacks might be considered low on these networks and therefore implementing DNSSEC is still recommended but not with a high priority. 

Note: Choose a robust signing algorithm when setting up DNSSEC, such as `rsasha256`. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[insecure] `rsasha1` algorithm should no longer be used.
