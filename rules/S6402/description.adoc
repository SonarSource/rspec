Domain Name Systems (DNS) are vulnerable by default to various types of attacks. One of the biggest risks is DNS cache poisoning which occurs when a DNS accepts spoofed DNS data, caches the malicious records, and potentially sends them later in response to legitimate DNS request lookups. This attack typically relies on the attacker's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack[MITM] ability on the network and can be used to redirect users from an intended website to a malicious website.

Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provides a way to verify integrity of DNS data by digitally signing DNS zones. Note that DNSSEC doesn't encrypt DNS data, so their confidentiality is not guaranteed. DNSSEC involves a chain of trust to ensure that the public key of a DNS zone used to validate signatures can be trusted, to do this the parent DNS zone adds a "fingerprint" of the child zone public key in a "DS record" and sign it with its own private key, and so on until the root zone.
