Domain Name Systems (DNS) are vulnerable by default to various types of attacks.

One of the biggest risks is DNS cache poisoning, which occurs when a DNS accepts spoofed DNS data, caches the malicious records, and potentially sends them later in response to legitimate DNS request lookups. This attack typically relies on the attacker's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack[MITM] ability on the network and can be used to redirect users from an intended website to a malicious website.

To prevent these vulnerabilities, Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) ensure the integrity and authenticity of DNS data by digitally signing DNS zones.

The public key of a DNS zone used to validate signatures can be trusted as DNSSEC is based on the following chain of trust:

* The parent DNS zone adds a "fingerprint" of the public key of the child zone in a "DS record".
* The parent DNS zone signs it with its own private key.
* And this process continues until the root zone.
