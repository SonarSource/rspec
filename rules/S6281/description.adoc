By default S3 buckets are private, it means that only the bucket owner can access it.

This access control can be relaxed with ACLs or policies.


To prevent permissive policies to be set on a S3 bucket the following settings can be configured:

* ``++BlockPublicAcls++``: to block or not public ACLs to be set to the S3 bucket.
* ``++IgnorePublicAcls++``: to consider or not existing public ACLs set to the S3 bucket.
* ``++BlockPublicPolicy++``: to block or not public policies to be set to the S3 bucket.
* ``++RestrictPublicBuckets++``: to restrict or not the access to the S3 endpoints of public policies to the principals within the bucket owner account.
