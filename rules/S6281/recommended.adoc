== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to configure:

* ``++BlockPublicAcls++`` to ``++true++`` to block new attempts to set public ACLs.
* ``++IgnorePublicAcls++`` to ``++true++`` to block existing public ACLs.
* ``++BlockPublicPolicy++`` to ``++true++`` to block new attempts to set public policies.
* ``++RestrictPublicBuckets++`` to ``++true++`` to restrict existing public policies.
