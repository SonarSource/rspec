== Sensitive Code Example

By default, when not set, the ``++aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block++`` is fully deactivated (nothing is blocked):

----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mynoncompliantfirstbucket" { # sensitive: by default it's unsafe
  bucket = "mynoncompliantfirstbucketname"
}
----

This ``++aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block++`` allows public ACL to be set:

----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mynoncompliantsecondbucket" {  # sensitive (s6281)
  bucket = "mynoncompliantsecondbucketname"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "mynoncompliantspublicaccess" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mynoncompliantsecondbucket.id

  block_public_acls       = false # should be true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}

----

== Compliant Solution

This ``++aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block++`` blocks public ACLs and policies, ignores existing public ACLs and restricts existing public policies:

----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mycompliantbucket" {
  bucket = "mycompliantbucketname"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "mycompliantpublicaccess" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mycompliantbucket.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
