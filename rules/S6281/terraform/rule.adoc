== Sensitive Code Example

By default, when not set, the ``++aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block++`` is fully deactivated (nothing is blocked):

[source,terraform]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" { # Sensitive: no Public Access Block defined for this bucket
  bucket = "example"
}
----

This ``++aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block++`` allows public ACL to be set:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {  # Sensitive
  bucket = "examplename"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example-public-access-block" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  block_public_acls       = false # should be true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}

----

== Compliant Solution

This ``++aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block++`` blocks public ACLs and policies, ignores existing public ACLs and restricts existing public policies:

[source,terraform]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example-public-access-block" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
