== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to configure:

* `blockPublicAcls` to `True` to block new attempts to set public ACLs.
* `ignorePublicAcls` to `True` to block existing public ACLs.
* `blockPublicPolicy` to `True` to block new attempts to set public policies.
* `restrictPublicBuckets` to `True` to restrict existing public policies.
