== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to configure:

* `block_public_acls` to `True` to block new attempts to set public ACLs.
* `ignore_public_acls` to `True` to block existing public ACLs.
* `block_public_policy` to `True` to block new attempts to set public policies.
* `restrict_public_buckets` to `True` to restrict existing public policies.
