By default S3 buckets are private, it means that only the bucket owner can access it.

This access control can be relaxed with ACLs or policies.


To prevent permissive policies to be set on a S3 bucket the following booleans settings can be enabled:

* `block_public_acls`: to block or not public ACLs to be set to the S3 bucket.
* `ignore_public_acls`: to consider or not existing public ACLs set to the S3 bucket.
* `block_public_policy`: to block or not public policies to be set to the S3 bucket.
* `restrict_public_buckets`: to restrict or not the access to the S3 endpoints of public policies to the principals within the bucket owner account.

The other attribute `BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS` only turns on `block_public_acls` and `ignore_public_acls`. The public policies can still affect the S3 bucket.


However, all of those options can be enabled by setting the `block_public_access` property of the S3 bucket to `BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL`.
