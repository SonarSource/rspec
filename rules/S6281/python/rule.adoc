By default S3 buckets are private, it means that only the bucket owner can access it.

This access control can be relaxed with ACLs or policies.


To prevent permissive policies to be set on a S3 bucket the following booleans settings can be enabled:

* `block_public_acls`: to block or not public ACLs to be set to the S3 bucket.
* `ignore_public_acls`: to consider or not existing public ACLs set to the S3 bucket.
* `block_public_policy`: to block or not public policies to be set to the S3 bucket.
* `restrict_public_buckets`: to restrict or not the access to the S3 endpoints of public policies to the principals within the bucket owner account.

The other attribute `BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS` only turns on `block_public_acls` and `ignore_public_acls`. The public policies can still affect the S3 bucket.


However, all of those options can be enabled by setting the `block_public_access` property of the S3 bucket to `BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL`.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to configure:

* `block_public_acls` to `True` to block new attempts to set public ACLs.
* `ignore_public_acls` to `True` to block existing public ACLs.
* `block_public_policy` to `True` to block new attempts to set public policies.
* `restrict_public_buckets` to `True` to restrict existing public policies.


== Sensitive Code Example

By default, when not set, the `block_public_access` is fully deactivated (nothing is blocked):

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket"        # Sensitive
)
----

This `block_public_access` allows public ACL to be set:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(
        block_public_acls=False,       # Sensitive
        ignore_public_acls=True,
        block_public_policy=True,
        restrict_public_buckets=True
    )
)
----

The attribute `BLOCK_ACLS` only blocks and ignores public ACLs:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS     # Sensitive
)
----

== Compliant Solution

This `block_public_access` blocks public ACLs and policies, ignores existing public ACLs and restricts existing public policies:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL # Compliant
)
----

A similar configuration to the one above can obtained by setting all parameters of the `block_public_access`

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(       # Compliant
        block_public_acls=True,
        ignore_public_acls=True,
        block_public_policy=True,
        restrict_public_buckets=True
    )
)
----
