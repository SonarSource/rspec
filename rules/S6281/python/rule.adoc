== Sensitive Code Example

By default, when not set, the `block_public_access` is fully deactivated (nothing is blocked):

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket"        # Sensitive
)
----

This `block_public_access` allows public ACL to be set:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(
        block_public_acls=False,       # Sensitive
        ignore_public_acls=True,
        block_public_policy=True,
        restrict_public_buckets=True
    )
)
----

The attribute `BLOCK_ACLS` only blocks and ignores public ACLs:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS     # Sensitive
)
----

== Compliant Solution

This `block_public_access` blocks public ACLs and policies, ignores existing public ACLs and restricts existing public policies:

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL # Compliant
)
----

A similar configuration to the one above can obtained by setting all parameters of the `block_public_access`

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(       # Compliant
        block_public_acls=True,
        ignore_public_acls=True,
        block_public_policy=True,
        restrict_public_buckets=True
    )
)
----
