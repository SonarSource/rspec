== Why is this an issue?

Using dark colors in UI design, especially on mobile devices with (AM)OLED screens, offers various benefits such as reduced power consumption and eye strain for users.
Therefore, it's recommended to prioritize Dark UI mode in mobile applications.
To comply with this rule, avoid using custom resources with bright color values or bitmap images with excessively high luminance.

=== What is the potential impact?

* _Visibility_: bright UI elements can be harsh on the eyes, especially in low-light environments, leading to discomfort or eye strain for users.
* _Readability_: dark UI mode is easier on the eyes and can improve readability and usability in low-light environments.
* _Sustainability_: bright UI elements consume more power, and the extra energy required has a negative impact on the environment.

== How to fix it

* *Implement Dark UI Mode*: Update your mobile application to include a Dark UI mode option
* *Use Dark Color Schemes*: When designing UI elements, use dark color schemes to reduce the overall brightness of the interface

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,xml,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<!-- Using a bright color for the primary theme color -->
<color name="colorPrimary">#FFFFFF</color> // Noncompliant

<!-- Using a bitmap image with high luminance -->
<ImageView
  android:id="@+id/imageView"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  android:src="@drawable/bright_image"/>   // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,xml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<!-- Using a dark color for the primary theme color -->
<color name="colorPrimary">#212121</color> // Compliant

<!-- Using a bitmap image suitable for Dark UI mode -->
<ImageView
  android:id="@+id/imageView"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  android:src="@drawable/dark_image"/>     // Compliant
----
