<div class="paragraph">
<p>Postman is an API development and testing platform that allows developers to design, build, and test APIs. Postman tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes when making API requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a Postman token is leaked or compromised, it can lead to several security issues and risks. Here are some potential consequences:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_unauthorized_access">Unauthorized access</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attacker who gains access to a leaked token can use it to impersonate the legitimate user or application associated with the token. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality within the API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_data_breaches">Data breaches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the leaked token provides access to sensitive data, an attacker can use it to retrieve or manipulate that data. This can lead to data breaches that compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Depending on the type of data that is compromised, it could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or other
negative outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a
reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_api_abuse">API abuse</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a leaked token, an attacker can abuse the API by making unauthorized requests, consuming excessive resources, or performing malicious actions. This can disrupt the API&#8217;s regular operation, impact performance, or even cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_privilege_escalation">Privilege escalation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the permissions and scope associated with the token, an attacker may be able to escalate their privileges within the API. They can gain access to additional resources or perform actions that they are not authorized to do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_breach_of_trust_in_non_repudiation_and_disruption_of_the_audit_trail">Breach of trust in non-repudiation and disruption of the audit trail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When such a secret is compromised, malicious actors might have the possibility
to send malicious event objects, causing discrepancies in the audit trail. This
can make it difficult to trace and verify the sequence of events, impacting the
ability to investigate and identify unauthorized or fraudulent activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All in all, this can lead to problems in proving the validity of transactions
or actions performed, potentially leading to disputes and legal complications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_reputation_damage">Reputation damage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a token is leaked and used for malicious purposes, it can damage the reputation of the API provider. Users may lose trust in the security of the API, leading to a loss of business and credibility.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
