Using unencrypted RDS DB resources exposes data to unauthorized access to the
underlying storage. +
This includes database data, logs, automatic backups, read replicas, snapshots,
and cluster metadata.

This situation can occur in a variety of scenarios, such as:

* a malicious insider working at the cloud provider gains physical access to the storage device.
* unknown attackers penetrate the cloud provider's logical infrastructure and systems.

After a succesful intrusion, the underlying applications is exposed to:

* Theft of intellectual property and/or personal data
* Extortion
* Denial of services and security bypasses

AWS-managed encryption at rest reduces this risk with a simple switch.
