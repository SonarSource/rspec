Using unencrypted RDS DB resources exposes the data to unauthorized access to
the underlying storage. +
This includes DB instances, logs, automated backups, read replicas, snapshots and cluster data.

This situation can occur in several scenarios, such as:

* unknown attackers penetrating the cloud provider's logical infrastructure and systems for extortion.

AWS managed encryption at rest reduces this risk with a simple switch.
