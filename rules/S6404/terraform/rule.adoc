Granting public access to GCP resources may reduce an organization's ability to
protect itself against attacks or theft of its GCP resources. +
Security incidents associated with misuse of public access include disruption
of critical functions, data theft, and additional costs due to resource
overload.

To be as prepared as possible in the event of a security incident,
authentication combined with fine-grained permissions helps maintain the
principle of defense in depth and trace incidents back to the perpetrators.

GCP also provides the ability to grant access to a large group of people:

* If public access is granted to all Google users, the impact of a data theft
  is the same as if public access is granted to all Internet users.

* If access is granted to a large Google group, the impact of a data theft is
  limited based on the size of the group.

The only thing that changes in these cases is the ability to track user access in the event of an incident.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* This GCP resource is essential to the information system infrastructure.
* This GCP resource is essential to mission-critical functions.
* This GCP resource stores or processes sensitive data.
* Compliance policies require that access to this resource be authenticated.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Explicitly set access to this resource or function as private.

== Sensitive Code Example

For IAM resources:

----
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_binding" "example" {
  members = [
    "allUsers",              # Sensitive
    "allAuthenticatedUsers", # Sensitive
  ]
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "example" {
  member = "allAuthenticatedUsers" # Sensitive
}
----

For ACL resources:

----
resource "google_storage_bucket_access_control" "example" {
  entity = "allUsers" # Sensitive
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_acl" "example" {
  role_entity = [
    "READER:allUsers",              # Sensitive
    "READER:allAuthenticatedUsers", # Sensitive
  ]
}
----

For container clusters:

----
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  private_cluster_config {
    enable_private_nodes    = false # Sensitive
    enable_private_endpoint = false # Sensitive
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

For IAM resources:

----
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_binding" "example" {
  members = [
    "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.example.email}",
    "group:${var.example_group}"
  ]
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "example" {
  member = "user:${var.example_user}" # Sensitive
}
----

For ACL resources:

----
resource "google_storage_bucket_access_control" "example" {
  entity = "user-${var.example_user]"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_acl" "example" {
  role_entity = [
    "READER:user-name@example.com",
    "READER:group-admins@example.com"
  ]
}
----

For container clusters:

----
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  private_cluster_config {
    enable_private_nodes    = true
    enable_private_endpoint = true
  }
}
----

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

* For container clusters:
** Omitted: Omitting {attribute} grants public access to parts of this cluster. Make sure it is safe here.
** Explicitly set to false: Ensure that granting public access is safe here.
* For the rest: Ensure that granting public access to this resource is safe here.
* For ACL resources: Ensure that granting public access to this resource is safe here.
* For DNS-managed zone omissions: Omitting {attribute} will grant public access to this managed zone. Ensure it is safe here.

=== Highlighting

* Assignments: Highlight the sensitive assignment.
* Lists: Highlight the sensitive element.
* Multiple sensitive items: Highlight the resource.
