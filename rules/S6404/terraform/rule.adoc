Granting public access to resources may reduce an organization's ability to
protect against attacks or theft of its GCP resources. +
Note: Granting access to all users or all users with a Google account poses a similar
risk.

Security incidents associated with misuse of public access include disruption
of critical functions, data theft, and additional costs due to resource
congestion.

Using authentication in conjunction with fine-grained permissions helps
maintain the principle of defense in depth and trace incidents back to the
perpetrators.
