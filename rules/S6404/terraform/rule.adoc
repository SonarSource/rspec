Granting public access to resources may reduce an organization's ability to
protect itself against attacks or theft of its GCP resources.

Security incidents related to public access can include disruption of critical
functions, data theft, and additional costs due to resource overload.

Using authentication in conjunction with fine-grained permissions helps
following the defense-in-depth principle and helps trace incidents back to
their perpetrators.
