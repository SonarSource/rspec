== Why is this an issue?

Field-like events are events that do not have explicit ``++add++`` and ``++remove++`` methods. The compiler generates a ``++private++`` ``++delegate++`` field to back the event, as well as generating the implicit ``++add++`` and ``++remove++`` methods.


When a ``++virtual++`` field-like ``++event++`` is overridden by another field-like ``++event++``, the behavior of the C# compiler is to generate a new ``++private++`` ``++delegate++`` field in the derived class, separate from the parent's field. This results in multiple and separate events being created, which is rarely what's actually intended.


To prevent this, remove the ``++virtual++`` designation from the parent class event.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
abstract class Car
{
  public virtual event EventHandler OnRefueled; // Noncompliant

  public void Refuel()
  {
    // This OnRefueled will always be null
     if (OnRefueled != null)
     {
       OnRefueled(this, null);
     }
  }
}

class R2 : Car
{
  public override event EventHandler OnRefueled;
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var r2 = new R2();
    r2.OnRefueled += new EventHandler((o, a) =>
    {
      Console.WriteLine("This event will never be called");
    });
    r2.Refuel();
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
abstract class Car
{
  public event EventHandler OnRefueled; // Compliant

  public void Refuel()
  {
    if (OnRefueled != null)
    {
      OnRefueled(this, null);
    }
  }
}

class R2 : Car {}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var r2 = new R2();
    r2.OnRefueled += new EventHandler((o, a) =>
    {
      Console.WriteLine("This event will be called");
    });
    r2.Refuel();
  }
}
