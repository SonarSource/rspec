Nested code blocks create a new scope where variables declared within are inaccessible from the outside and their lifespan ends with the block.

Although this may appear beneficial, its usage within a function often suggests that the function is overloaded, thus it may violate the Single Responsibility Principle,
and needs to be broken down into smaller functions.

The presence of superfluous blocks that don't affect the control flow or create a new scope can be misleading and might suggest possible mistakes in the code.
