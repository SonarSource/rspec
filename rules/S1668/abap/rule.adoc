== Noncompliant Code Example

----
TRY. 
     ... 
  CATCH: cx_1, cx_2, cx_3.  " only cx_3 gets the following CATCH block
     "exception handling 
      ... 
ENDTRY.

TRY. 
     ... 
  CATCH cx_1.
     "exception handling 
  CATCH cx_2.
     "exception handling 
  CATCH cx_3. 
     "exception handling 
      ... 
ENDTRY.
