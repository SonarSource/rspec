\[~samuel.mercier], a few things of note, which I've fixed on this instance:

* Code should be quoted in the message, i.e. "<csignal>" rather than <csignal>. Ideally it's quoted in the summary as well, but since we're using the MISRA titles verbatim...
* Add a See section to the description listing the appropriate MISRA number
* Fill in Applicability. Almost always this is both Sources and Tests
* Make sure the appropriate MISRA C and MISRA {cpp} fields on the references tab are filled in (this step is the easiest for me to forget)

Also, issue messages don't wrap, so I usually try to keep the length down.

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] this rule is still in 'targeted' state for {cpp}. Seems very combinable with RSPEC-987
