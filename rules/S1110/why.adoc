== Why is this an issue?

Parentheses can disambiguate the order of operations in complex expressions and make the code easier to understand.

[source,{lang}]
----
a = (b * c) + (d * e); // Compliant: the intent is clear.
----

Redundant parentheses are parenthesis that
do not change the behavior of the code, and
do not clarify the intent.
They can mislead and complexify the code.
They should be removed.
