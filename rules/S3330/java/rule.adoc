== Sensitive Code Example

If you create a security-sensitive cookie in your JAVA code:

----
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setHttpOnly(false);  // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
----

By default the https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setHttpOnly(boolean)[``++HttpOnly++``] flag is set to _false:_

----
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);  // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag not defined (by default set to false) and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setHttpOnly(true); // Compliant: this sensitive cookie is protected against theft (HttpOnly=true)
----
