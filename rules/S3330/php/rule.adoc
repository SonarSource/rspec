== Sensitive Code Example

In _php.ini_ you can specify the flags for the session cookie which is security-sensitive:

----
session.cookie_httponly = 0;  // Sensitive: this sensitive session cookie is created with the httponly flag set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
----

Same thing in PHP code:

----
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, true, false);  // Sensitive: this sensitive session cookie is created with the httponly flag (the fifth argument) set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
----

If you create a custom security-sensitive cookie in your PHP code:

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true, false); // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag (the seventh argument) set to false  and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
----

By default https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php[``++setcookie++``] and https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setrawcookie.php[``++setrawcookie++``] functions set ``++httpOnly++`` flag to _false_ (the seventh argument) and so cookies can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability:

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true); // Sensitive: a sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag  (the seventh argument) not defined (by default set to false)
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true); // Sensitive: a sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag (the seventh argument) not defined  (by default set to false)
----

== Compliant Solution

----
session.cookie_httponly = 1; // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks (cookie_httponly=1)
----

----
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, true, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the fifth argument set to true (HttpOnly=true)
----

----
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the seventh argument set to true (HttpOnly=true)
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the seventh argument set to true (HttpOnly=true)
