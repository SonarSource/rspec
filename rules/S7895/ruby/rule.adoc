This rule raises an issue when numeric HTTP status codes are used in Rails render methods instead of their symbolic equivalents.

== Why is this an issue?

Using numeric HTTP status codes like `403`, `404`, or `500` makes code less readable and more prone to errors. These "magic numbers" require developers to memorize or look up what each code means, reducing code clarity.

Symbolic status codes like `:forbidden`, `:not_found`, or `:internal_server_error` are self-documenting. They immediately convey the meaning without requiring knowledge of HTTP status code numbers. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand for developers at all experience levels.

Additionally, symbolic codes reduce the risk of typos. It's easier to catch a misspelled symbol than an incorrect number, and Ruby will raise an error for undefined symbols, providing immediate feedback during development.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using numeric status codes reduces code readability and maintainability. While this doesn't create security vulnerabilities or runtime errors, it makes the codebase harder to understand and maintain. Developers may need to spend extra time looking up status code meanings, and there's a higher risk of introducing bugs through numeric typos that might not be immediately obvious during code review.

== How to fix it in Rails

Replace numeric HTTP status codes with their symbolic equivalents. Rails provides predefined symbols for all standard HTTP status codes.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
render status: 403 # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
render status: :forbidden
----

Use symbolic status codes for 404 Not Found responses.

or

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
render status: 404 # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
render status: :not_found
----

Use symbolic status codes for 500 Internal Server Error responses.

or

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
render status: 500 # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
render status: :internal_server_error
----
