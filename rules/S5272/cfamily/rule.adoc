Relying on an object that has been moved-from leads to undefined behavior in most cases.

== Why is this an issue?

After a move took place, the object that has been moved-from is left in a valid _but_ unspecified state.
Even if in a valid state, the fact of an object being in an unspecified state may lead to undefined behavior.

Move construction and its respective move semantics has been introduced in {cpp}11.
Moving objects becomes interesting if one wishes to get an object into a different scope, while no longer requiring the original object.
While one would previously need to make a potentially expensive copy to get an object into another scope and then destroy the original, move constructors allow one to _move_ objects without performing a copy.
Move constructors are typically implemented by "stealing" the resources held by another object specified as the move constructor's parameter, rather than making a copy.
"Stealing" resources (e.g. memory) from another object is oftentimes much more efficient than making a copy and destroying the original, and can frequently be implemented by reassigning a few pointer variables.

Move-assignment operators behave analogously, except that they are used once the object that is moved-to has already been constructed.
In contrast to copy-assignment operators, a move-assignment operator too "steals" the moved-from object's resources without the need for making a potentially expensive copy.


=== What is the potential impact?

Using an object after it has been moved-from typically leads to *undefined behavior*.

For programs that exercise undefined behavior, the compiler is no longer bound by the language specification.
The application may crash or, even worse, the application may appear to execute correctly while losing data or producing incorrect results.

Trying to access an object that has been moved-from frequently ends up in a null-pointer dereference, since any pointers to the resources that have been "stolen" are set to ``++nullptr++`` as part of the move construction or move assignment.


=== Exceptions

There are some C++ standard template library types such as `std::unique_ptr` for which the moved-from state is fully specified.


=== Exemplary type with move operations

The ``++DynamicIntArray++`` type defined in the following manages a resource, i.e., memory, and shall serve as an example that showcases how move operations "steal" another object's resources and how they differ from making copies.

While the copy constructor does make a full copy by allocating memory and then copying the ``++other++`` object's array values into the freshly allocated memory, the move constructor only assigns the pointer to point to ``++other++``'s dynamically allocated memory.
It then sets the pointer of the ``++other++`` object to ``++nullptr++`` to allow its correct cleanup by the destructor of the ``++DynamicIntArray++`` type.

The implementations for the copy- and move-assignment operators are similar with the main difference being that the objects have already been constructed.

== How to fix it

There are several potential ways to fix this issue, depending on the concrete situation.
Potential fixes include:

* Use the object _only before_ moving it
* Create a copy of the desired object and operate on the copy
* Completely remove the use of the object _after_ is has been moved-from

----
int foo() {
  DynamicIntArray a{128, 0};

  DynamicIntArray a2 = std::move(a);
  int x = a.getValueAt(0); // Noncompliant: `a` is moved-from. This particular access will lead to a null pointer dereference.

int foo() {

  DynamicIntArray a2 = std::move(a);
  int x = a2.getValueAt(0); // Compliant: the correctly move-constructed variable `a2` can be used, of course.
  return x;

void array_user(DynamicIntArray &&array);

int bar() {

  return a.getValueAt(42); // Noncompliant: `a` has been moved to `array_user()`.
}

void array_user(DynamicIntArray &&array);

int bar() {
