This rule applies to expressions of the form:

* integer_expression + pointer_expression
* pointer_expression + integer_expression
* pointer_expression - integer_expression
* {plus}{plus}pointer_expression
* pointer_expression{plus}{plus}
* --pointer_expression
* pointer_expression--
* pointer_expression [ integer_expression ]

where pointer_expression is a pointer to an array element.


It is undefined behaviour if the result obtained from one of the above expressions is not a pointer to an element of the array pointed to by pointer_expression or an element one beyond the end of that array.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void f1 ( const int32_t * a1 )
{
  int32_t a2[ 10 ];
  const int32_t * p1 = &a1 [ 1 ]; // Noncompliant - a1 is not an array
  int32_t * p2 = &a2 [ 9 ]; // Compliant
  int32_t * p3 = &a2 [ 10 ]; // Noncompliant, 10 is out of bound
}
