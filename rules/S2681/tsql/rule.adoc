``++BEGIN...END++`` can be omitted from a one-line block, such as with an ``++IF++`` statement or ``++WHILE++`` loop, but doing so can be misleading and induce bugs. 


This rule raises an issue when the indentation of the lines after a one-line block indicates an intent to include those lines in the block, but the omission of ``++BEGIN...END++`` means the lines will be unconditionally executed once.


Note that this rule considers tab characters to be equivalent to 1 space. If you mix spaces and tabs you will sometimes see issues in code which looks fine in your editor but is confusing when you change the size of tabs.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
IF (0=1)
  EXEC firstActionInBlock;
  EXEC secondAction;  -- Noncompliant; executed unconditionally
EXEC thirdAction;

IF (0=1) EXEC firstActionInBlock; EXEC secondAction;  -- Noncompliant; secondAction executed unconditionally

IF (0=1) EXEC firstActionInBlock;  -- Noncompliant
  EXEC secondAction;  -- Executed unconditionally
----

== Compliant Solution

----
IF (0=1) BEGIN
  EXEC firstActionInBlock;
  EXEC secondAction;
END
EXEC thirdAction;
----
