== Why is this an issue?

Having inconsistent indentation and omitting `BEGIN...END` from a control structure, such as an `IF` statement or `WHILE` loop, is misleading and can induce bugs.

This rule raises an issue when the indentation of the lines after a control structure indicates an intent to include those lines in the block, but the omission of `BEGIN...END` means the lines will be unconditionally executed once.

The following patterns are recognized:

[source,sql]
----
IF (0=1)
  EXEC firstActionInBlock;
  EXEC secondAction;  -- Noncompliant: secondAction is executed unconditionally
EXEC thirdAction;
----

[source,sql]
----
IF (0=1) EXEC firstActionInBlock; EXEC secondAction;  -- Noncompliant: secondAction is executed unconditionally
----

[source,sql]
----
IF (0=1) EXEC firstActionInBlock; 
  EXEC secondAction;  -- Noncompliant: secondAction is executed unconditionally
----

Note that this rule considers tab characters to be equivalent to 1 space. When mixing spaces and tabs, a code may look fine in one editor but be confusing in another configured differently.
