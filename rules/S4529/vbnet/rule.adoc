Exposing HTTP endpoints is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3072[CVE-2016-3072]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3175[CVE-2015-3175]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2003-0218[CVE-2003-0218]

HTTP endpoints are webservices' main entrypoint. Attackers will take advantage of any vulnerability by sending crafted inputs for headers (including cookies), body and URI. No input should be trusted and extreme care should be taken with all returned value (header, body and status code).


This rule flags code which creates HTTP endpoint via .Net Framework MVC Controllers.  It guides security code reviews to security-sensitive code.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
Public Class Foo
    Inherits System.Web.Mvc.Controller

    Public Property MyProperty As String
        Get
            Return "test"
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As String)
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Sub New()
    End Sub

    Public Sub PublicFoo() ' Sensitive. Public Controller methods are exposed as HTTP endpoints.
    End Sub

    <System.Web.Mvc.NonAction>
    Public Sub NotAnEndpoint() ' This is not an endpoint because of the NonAction attribute.
    End Sub

    Protected Sub ProtectedFoo()
    End Sub

    Friend Sub InternalFoo()
    End Sub

    Private Sub PrivateFoo()
    End Sub

    Private Class Bar
        Inherits System.Web.Mvc.Controller

        Public Sub InnerFoo()
        End Sub
    End Class
