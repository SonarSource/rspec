== Why is this an issue?

Even though closing an open file isn't always mandatory (for instance when stopping the execution of a COBOL program with the ``++STOP RUN++`` statement), it's good coding practice to always explicitly close any open files. This rule checks that for every ``++OPEN++`` statement there is a corresponding ``++CLOSE++`` statement somewhere in the program.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
OPEN INPUT my-file

=== Compliant solution

[source,cobol]
