Even though closing an open file isn't always mandatory (for instance when stopping the execution of a COBOL program with the ``++STOP RUN++`` statement), it's good coding practice to always explicitly close any open files. This rule checks that for every ``++OPEN++`` statement there is a corresponding ``++CLOSE++`` statement somewhere in the program.
