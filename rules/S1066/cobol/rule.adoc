== Why is this an issue?

Merging collapsible ``++IF++`` statements increases the code's readability.

Code like

[source,cobol]
----
       IF CONDITION1 THEN
         IF CONDITION2 THEN              *> Noncompliant
           ...
         END-IF
       END-IF.
----

Will be more readable as

[source,cobol]
----
       IF CONDITION1 AND CONDITION2 THEN *> Compliant
         ...
       END-IF.
