== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

Code like

[source,abap]
----
IF something.
  IF somethingElse.             " Noncompliant
    WRITE / 'hello'.
  ENDIF.
ENDIF.
----

Will be more readable as

[source,abap]
----
IF something and somethingElse. " Compliant
  WRITE / 'hello'.
ENDIF.
