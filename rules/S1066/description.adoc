Nested code - blocks of code inside blocks of code - is eventually necessary, but increases complexity. https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/[The Zen of Python], a text listing the Python philosophies, states "Flat is better than nested". That applies to other programming languages too and keeping the code as flat as possible, by avoiding unnecessary nesting, is considered a good practice.

Merging `if` statements when possible will decrease the nesting of the code and improve its readability.
