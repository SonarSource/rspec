== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

Code like

[source,python]
----
if condition1:
    if condition2:             # Noncompliant
        # ...
----

Will be more readable as

[source,python]
----
if condition1 and condition2:  # Compliant
    # ...
----

If merging the conditions seems to result in a more complex code, extracting the condition or part of it in a function or variable is a better approach to fix readability:

[source,python]
----
if file.isValid():
  if file.isFile() or file.isDirectory():     # Noncompliant
    # ...
----

Can be simplified to

[source,python]
----
def isFileOrDirectory(File file):
  return file.isFile() or file.isDirectory()

if file.isValid() and isFileOrDirectory(file): # Compliant
  # ...
----
