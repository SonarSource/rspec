A considerable part of Security Detection relies entirely on logs, meaning that
covering the event logs of as much attack surface as possible guarantees a
proper efficiency of detection capabilities.

Logging allows operational and security teams to get detailed and real-time
feedback on an Information System's events. The logging coverage enables them
to quickly react to events, ranging from the most benign bugs to the most
impactful security incidents, such as intrusions.

Apart from security detection, logging capabilities also directly influence
future digital forensics analyses. For example, detailed logging will allow
investigators to establish a timeline of the actions perpetrated by an
attacker.
