== Sensitive Code Example

For https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3 access requests]:

----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mynoncompliantbucket" { # Sensitive
  bucket = "mynoncompliantbucketname"
}
----

For https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/[Amazon API Gateways] X-Ray Tracing:

----
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "api-v1" {
  deployment_id = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.id
  rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example.id
  stage_name    = "v1-prod-api"
  xray_tracing_enabled = false # Sensitive
}
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3 access requests]:

----

}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mycompliantbucket" {
  bucket = "mycompliantbucketname"

  logging {
      target_bucket = "myloggingbucketname"
      target_prefix = "log/mycompliantbucket"
  }
}
----

For https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/[Amazon API Gateways] X-Ray Tracing:
