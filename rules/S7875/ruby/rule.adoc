This is an issue when a Rails application lacks a root route definition or uses incorrect controller#action syntax in route mappings.

== Why is this an issue?

Rails applications require a root route to define the homepage that users see when they visit the base URL. Without a root route, users encounter routing errors when accessing the application's main URL, which negatively impacts user experience, navigation, and SEO.

Additionally, Rails routes must use proper controller#action syntax to map URLs to controller actions correctly. The root directive and custom route definitions require the `controller#action` format (e.g., `'posts#index'`) rather than path format (e.g., `'posts/index'`). Incorrect syntax causes "Missing :action key" errors that prevent the application from starting.

Proper routing is fundamental to Rails applications because:

* The root route serves as the application's entry point and homepage
* Search engines and users expect a functional base URL
* Incorrect route syntax breaks the application's routing system entirely
* Rails conventions depend on explicit controller#action mappings for non-RESTful routes

=== What is the potential impact?

Missing root routes cause 404 errors when users visit the application's base URL, leading to poor user experience and reduced SEO rankings. Incorrect controller#action syntax prevents the Rails application from starting, causing complete application failure with "Missing :action key" errors during route loading.

== How to fix it in Rails

Add a root route definition using proper controller#action syntax. The root route should point to an appropriate controller action that serves as your application's homepage.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts
  get "up" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check
  # No root route defined // Noncompliant
end
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "posts#index"  # Proper controller#action syntax
  resources :posts
  get "up" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check
end
----

Fix incorrect controller#action syntax in route definitions. Use the hash (#) separator between controller and action names, not the forward slash (/).

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'landing/index'  # Incorrect path format // Noncompliant
  get 'script/index'    # Missing explicit action mapping // Noncompliant
end
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'landing#index'  # Correct controller#action format
  get 'script/index' => 'script#index'  # Explicit action mapping
end
----
