The analyzer should create an issue on ``++public static void main(String[] argv)++``, highlighting  ``++String[] argv++``. It should do so if and only if the parameter is used inside the method. This reduces the noise when the parameter is not used at all.


The only exception is Arg4J as there is no ``++main++`` method.


Note: The support of Argv4J without the use of ``++org.kohsuke.argv4j.Option++`` is out of scope as there is no way to know which Bean will be used as the ``++mainclass++``. See https://args4j.kohsuke.org/sample.html[Arg4J documentation] for more details.
