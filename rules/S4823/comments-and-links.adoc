\[~nicolas.harraudeau] Review

On which part of the code are we going to raise issues? Each time there is a command line executed taking some arguments or on each arguments of the command line? This needs to be clarify maybe by providing an example of command line execution using arguments.

Hi Team,


We have this security hotspot in our python source code and have validators framework configured to validate the command line arguments.


Here is the sample snippet.


*pip install validator-collection*


*from validator_collection import validators, checkers*


*validators.ipv4(sys.argv[1])*


But sonar still complains about input sanity, Please let us know which framework to use.


Thanks,


ABC

Hi [~prakash951],


Security Hotspots guide developers during their Code Review so that they can easily spot security sensitive code. You can find more information in [the documentation| \https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/security-hotspots/].


Next time could you please post your question on https://community.sonarsource.com/? It is our community support forum.
