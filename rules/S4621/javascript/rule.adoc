== Why is this an issue?

The TypeScript type system offers a basic support for composite types:

* _Union Types_ represent a value that can be one of the several types. They are constructed using a vertical bar (``++|++``) like the following ``++type NumberOrString = number | string++``.
* _Intersection Types_ combine multiple types into one, so that the object of such type will have all the members of all intersection type elements. They are constructed using an ampersand (``++&++``) like the following ``++type SerializablePerson = Person & Serializable++``. Intersection Types are often used to represent mixins.

Duplicating types when defining a union or interaction type makes the code less readable. Moreover duplicated types might be a simple mistake and another type should be used instead.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number | string) { // Noncompliant; 'string' type is used twice in a union type declaration
  // ...
}

function extend(p : Person) : Person & Person & Loggable { // Noncompliant; 'Person' is used twice
 // ...
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
function padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number | boolean) {
  // ...
}

function extend(p : Person) : Person & Loggable {
  // ...
}

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

Remove this duplicated type or replace with another one.


=== Highlighting

First: second occurrence of the element

Second: first occurrence ("Original"), third and all other occurrences ("Another duplicate")
