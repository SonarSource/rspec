Because parameter names could be changed during refactoring, they should not be spelled out literally in strings. Instead, use ``++NameOf()++``, and the string that's output will always be correct.


This rule raises an issue when any string in the ``++Throw++`` statement is an exact match for the name of one of the method parameters.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Public Sub DoSomething(param As Integer, secondParam As String)
    If (param < 0) 
        Throw New Exception("param") ' Noncompliant
    End If
    If secondParam is Nothing
      Throw New Exception("secondParam should be valid") ' Noncompliant
    End If
End Sub
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Public Sub DoSomething(param As Integer, secondParam As String)
    If (param < 0) 
        Throw New Exception(NameOf(param))
    End If
    If secondParam is Nothing
      Throw New Exception($"{NameOf(secondParam)} should be valid")
    End If
End Sub
----

== Exceptions

* The rule doesn't raise any issue when using VB.NET < 14.0.
* When the parameter name is contained in a sentence inside the ``++Throw++`` statement string, the rule will raise an issue only if the parameter name is at least 5 characters long. This is to avoid false positives.
