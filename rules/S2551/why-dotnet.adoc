== Why is this an issue?

Shared resources should not be used for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)[locking] as it increases the chance of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock[deadlocks]. Any other https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)[thread] could acquire (or attempt to acquire) the same lock while doing some operation, without knowing that the resource is meant to be used for locking purposes. 

A example of this is strings, which are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interning_(computer_science)[interned] by the runtime. This means that each string instance is immutable and stored, and then is reused everywhere it is referenced. 

Instead, a dedicated `object` instance should be used for each shared resource, to avoid deadlocks or lock contention.
