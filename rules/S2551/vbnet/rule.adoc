The following objects are considered as shared resources:

* a reference to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass#me[Me]: if the instance is publicly accessible, the lock might be shared
* a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type[Type] object: if the type class is publicly accessible, the lock might be shared
* a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/string-data-type[string] literal or instance: if any other part of the program uses the same string, the lock is shared because of interning
