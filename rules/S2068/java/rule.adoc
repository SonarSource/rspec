Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, passwords should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or that are open-source.


In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466[CVE-2019-13466]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389[CVE-2018-15389]

Passwords should be stored outside of the code in a configuration file, a database, or a password management service.


This rule flags instances of hard-coded passwords used in database and LDAP connections. It looks for hard-coded passwords in connection strings, and for variable names that match any of the patterns from the provided list.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The password allows access to a sensitive component like a database, a file storage, an API, or a service.
* The password is used in production environments.
* Application re-distribution is required before updating the password.

There would be a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,java]
----
String username = "steve";
String password = "blue";
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/test?" +
                  "user=" + username + "&password=" + password); // Sensitive
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,java]
----
String username = getEncryptedUser();
String password = getEncryptedPassword();
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/test?" +
                  "user=" + username + "&password=" + password);
----
