Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, passwords should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or that are open-source.


In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466[CVE-2019-13466]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389[CVE-2018-15389]

Passwords should be stored outside of the code in a configuration file, a database, or a password management service.


This rule flags instances of hard-coded passwords used in database and LDAP connections. It looks for hard-coded passwords in connection strings, and for variable names that match any of the patterns from the provided list.
