Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, passwords should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or that are open-source.


In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466[CVE-2019-13466]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389[CVE-2018-15389]

Passwords should be stored outside of the code in a configuration file, a database, or a management service for passwords.


This rule flags instances of hard-coded passwords used in database and LDAP connections. It looks for hard-coded passwords in connection strings, and for variable names that match any of the patterns from the provided list.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* Passwords allow access to a sensitive component like a database, a file storage, an API or a service.
* Passwords are used in production environments.
* Application re-distribution is required before updating the passwords.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Store the passwords in a configuration file that is not pushed to the code repository.
* Store the passwords in a database.
* Use your cloud provider's service for managing passwords.
* If a password has been disclosed through the source code: change it.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host:'localhost',
  user: "admin",
  database: "project",
  password: "mypassword", // sensitive 
  multipleStatements: true
});

connection.connect(); 
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,javascript]
----
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.MYSQL_URL,
  user: process.env.MYSQL_USERNAME,
  password: process.env.MYSQL_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.MYSQL_DATABASE
});
connection.connect();
