== Sensitive Code Example

----
MOVE "admin" TO UID.
MOVE "letMeIn" TO PWD.
EXEC SQL
  CONNECT :UID  *> Sensitive
  IDENTIFIED BY :PWD  *> Sensitive
  AT :MYCONN
  USING :MYSERVER
END-EXEC.

== Compliant Solution

[source,cobol]
----
DISPLAY env-name-pwd UPON ENVIRONMENT-NAME
ACCEPT env-val-pwd FROM ENVIRONMENT-VALUE *> Compliant

DISPLAY env-name-uid UPON ENVIRONMENT-NAME
ACCEPT env-val-uid FROM ENVIRONMENT-VALUE *> Compliant

EXEC SQL
  CONNECT :env-name-uid
  IDENTIFIED BY :env-val-pwd

FYI [~pierre-yves.nicolas]: COBOL subtask for RSPEC-2068 Credentials should not be hard-coded

\[~ann.campbell.2] What should we check here? Should we look for look for a more or less hardcoded password used in a database connection? I think that for other languages, we took a different approach: we look for variables which name contains "password" and which are assigned a hardcoded value.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] check out the Java code samples (RSPEC-2069), they parallel these quite closely. I.e. hard-coded strings used in the "password" position in a connection

\[~ann.campbell.2] OK, but I think that the current implementation of the Java rule would not catch the case mentioned in the example if the variable name was "pwd" instead of "password".
