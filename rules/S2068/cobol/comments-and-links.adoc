\[~ann.campbell.2] What should we check here? Should we look for look for a more or less hardcoded password used in a database connection?

\[~ann.campbell.2] OK, but I think that the current implementation of the Java rule would not catch the case mentioned in the example if the variable name was "pwd" instead of "password".
