\[~ann.campbell.2] and [~nicolas.peru], for a first implementation, I would do the following things :

* Search for all literals containing "password=xxxx"
* Search for all local variable whose names contains 'password' and which are initialized with a hardcoded literal.

For posterity,  list of translated words was removed and replaced by customizable parameter, because this was raising too many false postives.

\[~freddy.mallet] why do you think that semantic analysis is required? Current implementations (at least in SonarJava, SonarTS, SonarGo) rely only on AST, checking literal value or identifier name.

You're right [~tibor.blenessy] according to the current functional scope of this rule. I've updated the 'Analysis Level' field. Thanks

\[~tolun.ardahanli] the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extend/adding-coding-rules/#header-4[rule writing guide] says titles should be plural when possible. (Call me if you want the English language reasons.)  If there's a reason to make this one singular, then it now needs an article.

Hi [~pierre-loup.tristant], 


Have you considered usage of term URI instead of URL? URI seems more generic to me and RFC 3986 defines URI and userInfo part of it. So I think URI should be prefered here.

\[~pavel.mikula] I agree with you it should be URI instead or URL. You can go for "Review this hard-coded URI, which may contain a credential." as the new issue message.
