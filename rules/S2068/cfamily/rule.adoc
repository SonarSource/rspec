Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, credentials should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or that are open-source.


In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466[CVE-2019-13466]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389[CVE-2018-15389]

Credentials should be stored outside of the code in a configuration file, a database, or a management service for secrets. 


This rule looks for hard-coded credentials in variable names that match any of the patterns from the provided list.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
dbi_conn conn = dbi_conn_new("mysql");
string password = "secret"; // Sensitive
dbi_conn_set_option(conn, "password", password.c_str());
----

== Compliant Solution

----
dbi_conn conn = dbi_conn_new("mysql");
string password = getDatabasePassword(); // Compliant
dbi_conn_set_option(conn, "password", password.c_str()); // Compliant
