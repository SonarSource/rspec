== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Ensure that the HTTP client only accepts HTTPS pages. In `curl` this can be enabled using the option
  `--proto "=https"`.
* If it is not necessary to follow HTTP redirects, disable this in the HTTP client. In `curl` this is done by omitting
  the `-L` or `--location` option. In `wget` this is done by adding the option `--max-redirect=0`.
