== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Ensure that the HTTP client only accepts HTTPS pages. In curl, this can be enabled using the option `--proto "=https"`.
* If it is not necessary to follow HTTP redirects, then disable this in the HTTP client. In curl, this is done by omitting the `-L` or `--location` option.
