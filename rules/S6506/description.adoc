The usage of HTTPS is not enforced here. As it is possible for the HTTP client to follow redirects, such redirects might lead to websites using HTTP.

As HTTP is a clear-text protocol, it is considered insecure. Due to its lack of encryption, attackers that are able to sniff traffic from the network can read, modify, or corrupt the transported content. Therefore, allowing redirects to HTTP can lead to several risks:

* Exposure of sensitive data
* Malware-infected software updates or installers
* Corruption of critical information

Even in isolated networks, such as segmented cloud or offline environments, it is important to ensure the usage of HTTPS. If not, then insider threats with access to these environments might still be able to monitor or tamper with communications.
