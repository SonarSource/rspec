== Sensitive Code Example
In the examples below, an install script is downloaded using `curl` or `wget` and then executed.

While connections made using HTTPS are generally considered secure, `\https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh`
might redirect to a location that uses HTTP. Downloads made using HTTP are not secure and can be intercepted and
modified. An attacker could modify the install script to run malicious code inside the container.

`curl` will not follow redirects unless either `-L` or `--location` option is used.

# Sensitive
curl --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh | sh

`wget` will follow redirects by default.

# Sensitive
wget --secure-protocol=TLSv1_2 -q -O - https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh | sh

== Compliant Solution

If you expect the server to redirect the download to a new location, `curl` can use the option `--proto "=https"`
to ensure requests are only made using HTTPS. Any attempt to redirect to a location using HTTP will result in an error.

[source,shell,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
curl --proto "=https" --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh | sh
----

`wget` does not support this functionality so `curl` should be used instead.

If you expect the server to return the file without redirects, `curl` should not be instructed to follow redirects.
Remove any `-L` or `--location` options from the command.

[source,shell]
----
curl --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh | sh
----

`wget` uses the option `--max-redirect=0` to disable redirects.

[source,shell,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
wget --secure-protocol=TLSv1_2 --max-redirect=0 -q -O - https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh | sh
----
