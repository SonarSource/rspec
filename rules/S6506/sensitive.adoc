In the examples below, an install script is downloaded using `curl` or `wget` and then executed.

While connections made using HTTPS are generally considered secure, `\https://might-redirect.example.com/install.sh`
might redirect to a location that uses HTTP. Downloads made using HTTP are not secure and can be intercepted and
modified. An attacker could modify the install script to run malicious code inside the container.

`curl` will not follow redirects unless either `-L` or `--location` option is used.
