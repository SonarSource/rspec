<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Azure Subscription Keys are used to authenticate and authorize access to Azure
resources and services. These keys are unique identifiers that are associated
with an Azure subscription and are used to control access to resources such as
virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases. Subscription keys are
typically used in API requests to Azure services, and they help ensure that only
authorized users and applications can access and modify resources within an
Azure subscription.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an Azure Subscription Key is leaked to an unintended audience, it can pose a
significant security risk to the Azure subscription and the resources it
contains. An attacker who gains access to a subscription key can use it to
authenticate and access resources within the subscription, potentially causing
data breaches, data loss, or other malicious activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the level of access granted by the subscription key, an attacker
could potentially create, modify, or delete resources within the subscription,
or even take control of the entire subscription. This could result in
significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities for the
organization that owns the subscription.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Microsoft Azure provides an activity log that can be used to audit the access to the API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
