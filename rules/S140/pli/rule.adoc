This rule allows the definition of custom rules using XPath expressions.


Issues are created depending on the return value of the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns:

* a single or list of AST nodes, then a line issue with the given message is created for each node
* a boolean, then a file issue with the given message is created only if the boolean is true
* anything else, no issue is created

Here is an example of an XPath expression to log an issue on each ``++GO TO++`` statement:

//gotoStatement
