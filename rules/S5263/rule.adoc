While working with bitwise operators ``&`` or ``|`` it is easy to make a typo and write the equivalent logical operators ``&&`` or ``||``. This rule is raising issues when the right operand of a logical expression  ``&&`` or ``||`` is a constant of integral type, as the developer probably meant to use the corresponding bitwise operator ``&`` or ``|``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int fun(int a) {
  return a || 4; // Noncompliant, did you mean to use bitwise operator '|'?
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int fun(int a) {
 return a | 4;
}
----
