Within IAM, identity-based policies grant permissions to users, groups, or roles, and enable specific actions to be performed on designated resources. When an identity policy inadvertently grants more privileges than intended, certain users or roles might be able to perform more actions than expected. This can lead to potential security risks, as it enables malicious users to escalate their privileges from a lower level to a higher level of access.
