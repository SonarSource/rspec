=== What is the potential impact?
AWS IAM policies that contain overly broad permissions can lead to privilege escalation by granting users more access than necessary. They may be able to perform actions beyond their intended scope.

==== Privilege escalation
When IAM policies are too permissive, they grant users more privileges than necessary, allowing them to perform actions that they should not be able to. This can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources and perform malicious activities.

For example, if an IAM policy grants a user unrestricted access to all S3 buckets in an AWS account, the user can potentially read, write, and delete any object within those buckets. If an attacker gains access to this user's credentials, they can exploit this overly permissive policy to exfiltrate sensitive data, modify or delete critical files, or even launch further attacks within the AWS environment. This can have severe consequences, such as data breaches, service disruptions, or unauthorized access to other resources within the AWS account.
