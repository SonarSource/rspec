User provided data, such as URL parameters, should always be considered untrusted and tainted. Constructing SQL queries directly from tainted data enables attackers to inject specially crafted values that change the initial meaning of the query itself. Successful database query injection attacks can read, modify, or delete sensitive information from the database and sometimes even shut it down or execute arbitrary operating system commands.


Typically, the solution is to use prepared statements and to bind variables to SQL query parameters with dedicated methods like ``++params++``, which ensures that user provided data will be properly escaped. Another solution is to validate every parameter used to build the query. This can be achieved by transforming string values to primitive types or by validating them against a white list of accepted values.


This rule supports: sqlite3, mysql, pymysql, psycopg2, pgdb, Django ORM and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

== Noncompliant Code Example

Flask application

----
from flask import request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import text
from database.users import User

@app.route('hello')
def hello():
    id = request.args.get("id")
    stmt = text("SELECT * FROM users where id=%s" % id) # Query is constructed based on user inputs
    query = SQLAlchemy().session.query(User).from_statement(stmt) # Noncompliant
    user = query.one()
    return "Hello %s" % user.username
----

Django application

----
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.db import connection

def hello(request):
    id = request.GET.get("id", "")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT username FROM auth_user WHERE id=%s" % id) # Noncompliant; Query is constructed based on user inputs
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    return HttpResponse("Hello %s" % row[0])
