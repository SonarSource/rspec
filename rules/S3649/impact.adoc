=== What is the potential impact?

An attacker creates a link that injects malicious commands into the
application, knowing that a database server executes them. This link contains
custom queries that are refined to fit into the existing application query.

Note that these queries can also be incomprehensible to the human eye to bypass
incident handlers and potential security layers (such as web application
firewalls).

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.
