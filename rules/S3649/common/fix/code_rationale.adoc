The following code is an overly simple authentication function, as an example.
It is vulnerable to SQL injections because user-controlled data is inserted
directly into a query string: The application assumes that incoming data
always has a certain range of characters, and ignores that some characters can
break the query logic and make the query vulnerable to attack.

In this particular case, the query can be exploited with the following string: 

----
foo' OR 1=1 --
----

By adapting and inserting this template string into one of the fields (`user` or `pass`), an
attacker would be able to log in as any user within the scoped user table.
