==== Use secure APIs

Some frameworks provide a database abstraction layer that frees the developers
from sanitizing or writing prepared statements.

These provided APIs can be described as "secure by design". +
By providing a builder pattern with parameter binding behind the scenes,
`{secure_feature}` can be called "secure by design" as it adds
multiple layers of security to the code while keeping the codebase shorter.

*Note*: These types of APIs can also provide "raw" functions or equivalents. These
functions allow developers to create complex queries using the user-friendly
builder pattern. +
These methods should be considered unsafe and should not be used with untrusted
data.
For example, `{secure_feature}` exposes `{unsafe_function}` that is prone to injections.
