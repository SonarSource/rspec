==== Use secure APIs

Some libraries provide a database framework that frees the developer from
sanitizing or writing prepared statements.

These APIS can be described as "secure by design". +
By providing a builder pattern with PDO parameter binding behind the scenes,
`{secure_feature}` can be called "secure by design" as it adds
multiple layers of security to the code while keeping the codebase shorter.

*Note*: This type of API can also provide "raw" functions or equivalents. These
functions allow developers to create complex queries using the user-friendly
builder pattern. +
These methods should be considered unsafe and should not be used with untrusted
data.
