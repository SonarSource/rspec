Database injections (such as SQL injections) occur in an application when the
application retrieves data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it
into a database query. +
The most common cause is the belief that all user data is benevolent.

// - The payload is small-sized in the picture, and the impact is larger.
If an organization contains a database query that is vulnerable to injections,
it is exposed to attacks that target any database where that query is used.

A user with malicious intent carefully establishes the link beforehand.
// Here is an example:
// The image shows a SQL query embedded in a URL.

After creating the link, the attacker can attack an entire company without
relying on the actions of that company's employees.
