When the last arguments to a function are closures, it's possible and often desirable to write these closures after the function's parentheses. These are called _trailing_ closure arguments. In order to help distinguish trailing closure arguments from independent code blocks, it is best to begin the first closure argument on the same line as the function call and each following closure argument on the last line of the preceding one.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
funWithClosureArgument()
{ // Noncompliant; looks like an independent code block
   print("Hello world")
}

funWith3ClosureArguments {
  print("Hello world")
} b:
{  // Noncompliant; looks like an independent code block
  print("Hello world")
}
c: {  // Noncompliant; looks like an independent code block
  print("Hello world")
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
funWithClosureArgument() { 
   print("Hello world")
}

funWith3ClosureArguments {
  print("Hello world")
} b: {
  print("Hello world")
} c: {
  print("Hello world")
}
