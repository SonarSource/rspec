This rule raises an issue when ECMAScript built-in features are used that are not supported in the configured Node.js version range.

== Why is this an issue?

Using ECMAScript built-ins that are not supported in your target Node.js version can cause runtime errors when the code is executed in environments that don't support these features.

Node.js versions implement ECMAScript features at different times. For example, `Promise.allSettled` was introduced in Node.js 12.9.0, `BigInt` in Node.js 10.4.0, and `globalThis` in Node.js 12.0.0. If your code uses these features but targets an older Node.js version, it will fail at runtime.

This rule helps maintain compatibility by detecting these incompatibilities at development time, preventing deployment of code that won't work in the target environment.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using unsupported ECMAScript built-ins can cause:

* Runtime errors in production environments
* Application crashes when the unsupported feature is accessed
* Inconsistent behavior across different deployment environments
* Failed deployments in environments with older Node.js versions

=== How to fix?


Remove or replace the unsupported ECMAScript built-in with a compatible alternative or polyfill.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// Targeting Node.js 10.x
const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises); // Noncompliant: Promise.allSettled requires Node.js 12.9.0+
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Targeting Node.js 10.x
const results = await Promise.all(
  promises.map(p => p.catch(err => ({ error: err })))
);
