== Why is this an issue?

A ``++FETCH++`` statement fails when the number of variables does not match the number of columns selected in the CURSOR definition.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
DECLARE c1 cursor FOR SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM customer;
OPEN c1;
FETCH NEXT FROM c1 INTO @Name; -- Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
DECLARE c1 cursor FOR SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM customer;
OPEN c1;
FETCH NEXT FROM c1 INTO @FirstName, @LastName;
----
