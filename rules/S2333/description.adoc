The methods declared in an ``++interface++`` are ``++public++`` and ``++abstract++`` by default. Any variables are automatically ``++public static final++``. Finally, ``++class++`` and ``++interface++`` are automatically ``++public static++``. There is no need to explicitly declare them so.


Since annotations are implicitly interfaces, the same holds true for them as well.


Similarly, the ``++final++`` modifier is redundant on any method of a ``++final++`` class, ``++private++`` is redundant on the constructor of an ``++Enum++``, and ``++static++`` is redundant for ``++interface++`` nested into a ``++class++`` or ``++enum++``.
