Unnecessary keywords simply clutter the code and should be removed. Specifically:

* ``partial`` on type declarations that are completely defined in one place
* ``sealed`` on members of ``sealed`` classes
* ``unsafe`` method or block inside construct already marked with ``unsafe``, or when there are no ``unsafe`` constructs in the block
* ``checked`` and ``unchecked`` blocks with no integral-type arithmetic operations 

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public partial class MyClass // Noncompliant
{
  public virtual void Method()
  {
  }
}

public sealed class MyOtherClass : MyClass
{
  public sealed override void Method() // Noncompliant
  {
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public class MyClass
{
  public virtual void Method()
  {
  }
}

public sealed class MyOtherClass : MyClass
{
  public override void Method()
  {
  }
}
----
