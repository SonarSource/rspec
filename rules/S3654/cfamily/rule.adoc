Throwing an exception from a destructor may result in a call to `std::terminate` and can introduce undefined behavior, meaning that your program could be terminated abruptly without being allowed to perform a clean shutdown.

== Why is this an issue?

Destructors are usually (implicitly) declared as `noexcept` by default such that `std::terminate` is called when they throw an exception.
Destructors may still propagate an exception if they are explicitly declared as `noexcept(false)`.
However, even a destructor declared as `noexcept(false)` will call `std::terminate` if it throws during stack unwinding.

A commonly used example that highlights the severity of the underlying problem is presented in what follows:

The destructor of a container needs to call the destructors for all managed objects.
Suppose a call to an object's destructor throws an exception.
In that case, there are only two _conceptual_ ways to proceed:

1. Abort destruction. This will result in a partially destroyed object and possibly many more objects whose destructor has not been called.
2. Ignore the exception and proceed with destroying the remaining objects. However, this potentially results in more partially destroyed objects if further destructors throw an exception.

Both options are undesired; hence, whenever an object managed by a C++ standard container throws an exception, the behavior is undefined.

Thus, destructors should never `throw` exceptions.
Instead, they should catch and handle those thrown by the functions they call and be `noexcept`.


This rule raises an issue when a destructor is not `noexcept`. Destructors are `noexcept` by default, so usually nothing needs to be written in the source code. However, a destructor becomes not `noexcept` if:

* the base class or a data member has a non `noexcept` destructor,
* the destructor is decorated with the `noexcept` keyword followed by something that evaluates to false.

== How to fix it
=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  ~A() noexcept(false) {} // Noncompliant
};

struct C {
  /* ... */
  A a; // This member data prevents automatic declaration of the destructor as noexcept
  ~C() { // Noncompliant
    /* ... */
  }
};
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  ~A() noexcept(true) {}
};

struct C {
  /* ... */
  A a;
  ~C() { // Compliant, noexcept by default
    /* ... */
  }
};

This rule raises an issue when a destructor is not specified to be noexcept. Note that most of the time, nothing needs to be written in the source code, because destructors are, by default, noexcept if their data members allow it.

It raises a rule when ``++noexcept++`` isn't used, but you don't need to use ``++noexcept++`` because that's the default...?

\[~ann.campbell.2]

There is a distinction between being noexcept (a property of a function) and using the ``++noexcept++`` keyword to coerce the noexcept status. Here, the destructor needs to be noexcept, we don't directly care about the keyword (this is a change in behaviour from the previous implementation).


By default a destructor is noexcept. There are two ways for it not to be noexcept:

* It is decorated with the ``++noexcept++`` keyword followed by something that evaluates to false
* Some data member/base class prevent it from being noexcept (which means there is a violation of this rule on another class)

Maybe remving the word "specified" in the quoted sentence would make it clearer?

I counter-propose:

____
This rule raises an issue when 

* a destructor's default ``++noexcept++`` behavior is overridden
* a destructor throws an exception
* a destructor allows an exception to be thrown from one of its calls
____

Because once you introduce an explicit  "raises an issue" clause, you need to cover all the cases.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Only the first bullet of your list is (partially) covered. So I prefer to keep "when a destructor is not ``++noexcept++``".

It would be nice to detect that a destructor throws (directly or indirectly) an exception, but :

* This would be very hard to do correctly, and we are not doing it in this case
* This belongs, I believe, to a more generic, yet to be written, rule: ``++noexcept++`` functions should not throw.
