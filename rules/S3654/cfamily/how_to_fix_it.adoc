== How to fix it

This rule raises an issue when a destructor is not `noexcept`.

Usually, nothing needs to be written in the source code because destructors are `noexcept` by default.
However, a destructor becomes not `noexcept` when:

* The base class or a data member has a non `noexcept` destructor;
* The destructor is decorated with the `noexcept(expression)`  and `expression` evaluates to `false`.

The code should be modified to avoid those two scenarios.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

// Not using diff-highlighting since most lines are changed.
[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  ~A() noexcept(false) {} // Noncompliant
};

struct C {
  A a; // This member data prevents automatic declaration of the destructor as noexcept

  ~C() { // Noncompliant by transitivity
    // ...
  }
};
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct A {
  ~A() noexcept(true) {} // Compliant
};

struct C {
  A a;

  ~C() { // Compliant, noexcept by default
    // ...
  }
};
----
