=== What is the potential impact?

You can end up with `DateTime` instants that have no meaning for anyone except the machine they were recorded on.
Using UTC gives an unambiguous representation of an instant, and this UTC instant can be transformed into any equivalent local time. This operation isn't reversible as some local times are ambiguous and can be matched to more than one UTC instant (for example, due to daylight savings).
