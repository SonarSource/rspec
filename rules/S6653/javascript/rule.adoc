== Why is this an issue?

The `Object.hasOwn()` method was introduced in ES2022 as a replacement for the more verbose `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()`. These methods return `true` if the specified property of an object exists as its _own_ property. If the property is only available further down the prototype chain or does not exist at all - the methods return `false`.

If you are still using the old method - replace it with a simpler and more concise alternative.

You should also avoid calling the `obj.hasOwnProperty()` method directly, without using `Object.prototype` as a source. This can lead to a runtime error if `obj.prototype` is `null` and therefore `obj.hasOwnProperty` is undefined. The static method `Object.hasOwn()`  does not depend on the `obj.prototype` and is therefore safe to use in such cases.

[source,javascript]
----
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, "propertyName"); // Noncompliant
Object.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, "propertyName"); // Noncompliant
({}).hasOwnProperty.call(obj, "propertyName"); // Noncompliant

----

To fix the code replace `hasOwnProperty()` with `Object.hasOwn()`

[source,javascript]
----
Object.hasOwn(obj, "propertyName");
