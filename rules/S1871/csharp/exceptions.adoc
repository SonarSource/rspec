=== Exceptions

Blocks in an `if` chain that contain a single line of code are ignored, as are blocks in a `switch` statement that contain a single line of code with or without a following `break`.


[source,csharp]
----
if (a >= 0 && a < 10)
{
  DoTheThing();
}
else if (a >= 10 && a < 20)
{
  DoTheOtherThing();
}
else if (a >= 20 && a < 50)    //no issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
{
  DoTheThing();
}
----

But this exception does not apply to `if` chains without `else`-s, or to `switch`-es without default clauses when all branches have the same single line of code. In the case of `if` chains with `else`-s, or of `switch`-es with default clauses, rule S3923 raises a bug.

[source,csharp]
----
if (a == 1)
{
  DoSomething();  // Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
}
else if (a == 2)
{
  DoSomething();
}
