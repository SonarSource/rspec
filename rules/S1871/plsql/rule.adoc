== Why is this an issue?

Having two branches in an ``++IF++``/``++ELSIF++`` chain with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error.

If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then in an ``++IF++`` chain they should be combined.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
IF param = 1 THEN
    sort_order := 0;
    column := 'LastName';
ELSIF param = 2 THEN
    sort_order := 0;
    column := 'LastName'; -- Noncompliant
ELSE
    sort_order := 1;
    column := 'FirstName';
END IF;
----

=== Exceptions

Branches in an ``++IF++``/``++ELSIF++`` chain with implementation that contains a single line of code are ignored.

[source,sql]
----
IF param = 1 THEN
    sort_order := 0;
ELSIF param = 2 THEN
    sort_order := 1;
ELSE
    sort_order := 0; -- No issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
END IF;
----
But this exception does not apply to ``++IF++`` chains without ``++ELSE++``-s when all branches have the same single line of code. In case of ``++IF++`` chains with ``++ELSE++``-s rule S3923 raises a bug.

[source,sql]
----
IF param = 1 THEN  -- Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
    sort_order := 0;
ELSIF param = 2 THEN
    sort_order := 0;
END IF;
