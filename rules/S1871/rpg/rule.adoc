Having two ``++WHEN++`` in the same ``++SELECT++`` statement or branches in the same ``++IF++`` structure  with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error. If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, they should be combined.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
     C                   IF        X = 1
     C                   EXSR      SR01
     C                   EXSR      SR01
     C                   ELSEIF    X = 2
     C                   EXSR      SR02
     C                   ELSEIF    X = 3
     C                   EXSR      SR01                                         Noncompliant; duplicates first condition
     C                   EXSR      SR01
     C                   ENDIF

----
select;
  when i = 1; 
    doFirst();
    doSomething();
  when i = 2; 
    doSomethingDifferent();
  when i = 3:  // Noncompliant; duplicates first when's implementation
    doFirst();
    doSomething(); 
endsl;

if (a >= 0 and a < 10);
  doFirst();
  doTheThing();
elseif (a >= 10 and a < 20);
  doTheOtherThing();
elseif (a >= 20 and a < 50);
  doFirst();       // Noncompliant; duplicates first condition
  doTheThing();  
else;
  doTheRest(); 
endif;
----

== Exceptions

Blocks in an ``++if++`` chain or ``++select++`` statement that contain a single line of code are ignored.


----
if (a >= 0 and a < 10);
  doTheThing();
elseif (a >= 10 and a < 20);
  doTheOtherThing();
elseif (a >= 20 and a < 50);
  doTheThing();   //no issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
else;
  doTheRest(); 
endif;
----

But this exception does not apply to ``++if++`` chains without ``++else++``-s, or to ``++select++``-s without ``++other++`` clauses when all branches have the same single line of code. In case of ``++if++`` chains with ``++else++``-s, or of ``++select++``-s with ``++other++`` clauses, rule S3923 raises a bug. 

----
if (a >= 0 and a < 10);
  doTheThing();
elseif (a >= 20 and a < 50);
  doTheThing();   //Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
endif;
