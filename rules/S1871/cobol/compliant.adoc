If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then:

* in an `IF` structure they should be combined

[source,cobol,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
IF (X = 1) OR (X <= 10)
  MOVE A TO B.
  PERFORM SECTION1
ELSE
  PERFORM SECTION2
END-IF.
----

* for an `EVALUATE`, one should fall through to the other

[source,cobol,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
EVALUATE X
  WHEN 1
  WHEN 3
    MOVE A TO B.
    PERFORM SECTION1
  WHEN 2
    MOVE A TO C.
    PERFORM SECTION2
END-EVALUATE.
