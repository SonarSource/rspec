== Why is this an issue?

Having two ``++WHEN++`` clauses in the same ``++EVALUATE++`` statement or two branches in the same ``++IF++`` structure with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error. If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then they should be combined, for an ``++IF++`` structure or one should fall through to the other for an ``++EVALUATE++``.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cobol]
----
EVALUATE X
  WHEN 1
    MOVE A TO B.
    PERFORM SECTION1
  WHEN 2
    MOVE A TO C.
    PERFORM SECTION2
  WHEN 3              *> Noncompliant; duplicates WHEN 1's implementation
    MOVE A TO B.
    PERFORM SECTION1
END-EVALUATE.

IF X = 1
  MOVE A TO B.
  PERFORM SECTION1
ELSE
  IF X > 10
    PERFORM SECTION2
  ELSE                *> Noncompliant
    MOVE A TO B.
    PERFORM SECTION1
  END-IF
END-IF.
----

=== Exceptions

Blocks in an ``++IF++`` chain that contain a single line of code are ignored, as are blocks in a ``++EVALUATE++`` statement that contain a single line of code.


[source,cobol]
----
EVALUATE X
  WHEN 1
    PERFORM SECTION1
  WHEN 2
    PERFORM SECTION2
  WHEN 3              *> no issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
    PERFORM SECTION1
END-EVALUATE.
----

But this exception does not apply to ``++IF++`` chains without ``++ELSE++``-s, or to ``++EVALUATE++``-s without ``++WHEN OTHER++`` clauses when all branches have the same single line of code. In case of ``++IF++`` chains with ``++ELSE++``-s, or of ``++EVALUATE++``-es with ``++WHEN OTHER++`` clauses, rule S3923 raises a bug. 

[source,cobol]
----
EVALUATE X
  WHEN 1
    PERFORM SECTION1
  WHEN 3              *> Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
    PERFORM SECTION1
END-EVALUATE.
