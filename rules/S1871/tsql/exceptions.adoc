=== Exceptions

Branches in an `IF`/`ELSE IF` chain with an implementation that contains a single line of code are ignored. 

[source,sql]
----
IF @SortOrder = 1
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
ELSE IF @SortOrder = 2
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees
  END
ELSE
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName -- No issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
  END
GO
----

But this exception does not apply to `IF` chains without `ELSE`-s when all branches have the same single line of code. In the case of `IF` chains with `ELSE`-s rule S3923 raises a bug.

[source,sql]
----
IF @SortOrder = 1    -- Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
ELSE IF @SortOrder = 2
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
GO
