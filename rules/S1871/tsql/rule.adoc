Having two branches in an ``++IF++``/``++ELSE IF++`` chain with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error.

If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then in an ``++IF++`` chain they should be combined.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
IF @SortOrder = 1
  BEGIN
    SET @SortOrder = 0
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
ELSE IF @SortOrder = 2
  BEGIN
    SET @SortOrder = 0
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName -- Noncompliant
  END
ELSE
  BEGIN
    SET @SortOrder = -1
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees
  END
GO
----

== Exceptions

Branches in an ``++IF++``/``++ELSE IF++`` chain with implementation that contains a single line of code are ignored. 


----
IF @SortOrder = 1
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
ELSE IF @SortOrder = 2
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees
  END
ELSE
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName -- No issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
  END
GO
----


But this exception does not apply to ``++IF++`` chains without ``++ELSE++``-s when all branches have the same single line of code. In case of ``++IF++`` chains with ``++ELSE++``-s rule S3923 raises a bug. 


----
IF @SortOrder = 1    -- Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
ELSE IF @SortOrder = 2
  BEGIN
    SELECT LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName
  END
GO
