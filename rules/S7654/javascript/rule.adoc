This rule flags the usage of the `outputs` metadata property in `@Component` and `@Directive` decorators.

== Why is this an issue?

Using the `outputs` metadata property in Angular components and directives goes against Angular's style guide recommendations. This approach has several drawbacks:

**Reduced Type Safety**: The metadata property approach uses string-based declarations that are not checked by TypeScript. This means typos and incorrect property names won't be caught at compile time.

**Poor Developer Experience**: IDEs cannot provide proper autocomplete, refactoring support, or navigation when outputs are declared as strings in metadata.

**Inconsistent Code Style**: Mixing metadata-based declarations with decorator-based declarations creates inconsistent code patterns that are harder to maintain.

**Limited Tooling Support**: Angular's development tools and linters work better with the decorator approach, providing better analysis and suggestions.

The recommended approach is to use the `@Output()` decorator directly on class properties, which provides better type safety, IDE support, and follows Angular's established conventions.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using the `outputs` metadata property reduces code maintainability and type safety. It can lead to runtime errors from typos that would otherwise be caught at compile time, and makes the codebase harder to refactor and navigate.

=== How to fix?


Replace the `outputs` metadata property with `@Output()` decorators on class properties. This provides better type safety and follows Angular's style guide.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  outputs: ['valueChange', 'statusUpdate: status'], // Noncompliant
  template: '<div>Example</div>'
})
class ExampleComponent {
  valueChange = new EventEmitter<string>();
  statusUpdate = new EventEmitter<boolean>();
}

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div>Example</div>'
})
class ExampleComponent {
  @Output() valueChange = new EventEmitter<string>();
  @Output('status') statusUpdate = new EventEmitter<boolean>();
}
