This rule raises an issue when the `outputs` metadata property is used in `@Component` or `@Directive` decorators.

== Why is this an issue?

Using the `outputs` metadata property in Angular components and directives goes against the Angular Style Guide recommendations. This approach has several drawbacks:

**Reduced Type Safety**: When you declare outputs in the metadata object, TypeScript cannot verify that the corresponding properties exist on the class or that they have the correct types.

**Poor Developer Experience**: IDEs and development tools cannot provide proper autocomplete, refactoring support, or navigation features for outputs declared in metadata.

**Harder to Maintain**: Outputs declared in metadata are separated from their actual implementation in the class, making the code harder to understand and maintain. Developers need to look in multiple places to understand the component's interface.

**Inconsistent with Modern Angular**: The Angular team recommends using decorators directly on class members rather than metadata properties. This approach aligns with modern Angular patterns and provides better tooling support.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using the `outputs` metadata property reduces code maintainability and type safety. It can lead to runtime errors when output properties are renamed or removed without updating the metadata, and makes the codebase harder to refactor and understand.

=== How to fix?


Replace the `outputs` metadata property with `@Output()` decorators on individual class properties. This provides better type safety and follows Angular best practices.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  outputs: ['valueChange', 'statusUpdate: status'], // Noncompliant
  template: '<div>Example</div>'
})
class ExampleComponent {
  valueChange = new EventEmitter<string>();
  statusUpdate = new EventEmitter<boolean>();
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div>Example</div>'
})
class ExampleComponent {
  @Output() valueChange = new EventEmitter<string>();
  @Output('status') statusUpdate = new EventEmitter<boolean>();
}
