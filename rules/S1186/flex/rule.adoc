== Why is this an issue?

There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:


* It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed to prevent an unexpected behavior in production.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case an ``++NotSupportedException++`` should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,flex]
----
public override function doSomething():void {
}

public function doSomethingElse():void {
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,flex]
----
public override function doSomething():void {
  throw new IllegalOperationError("doSomething cannot be performed because ...");
}

public function doSomethingElse():void {
  //This method is empty because ...
}
