An empty method is generally considered bad practice and can lead to confusion, readability, and maintenance issues.
Empty methods bring no functionality and are misleading to others as they might think the method implementation fulfills a specific and identified requirement.

Such methods must be avoided and removed.

include::{empty-code}[]

However, there are some cases where a method needs to be empty without logic. In those cases, it is essential to minimize confusion and enhance clarity.

Here are a few examples:

* The method implementation will never be done.
+
--
include::{notsupported-code}[]
--
* The method implementation will be done in the future.
+
--
include::{notimplemented-code}[]
--
* The method implementation is empty intentionally.
+
--
include::{comment-code}[]
