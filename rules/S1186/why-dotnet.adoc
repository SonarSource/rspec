An empty {operationName} is generally considered bad practice and can lead to confusion, readability, and maintenance issues.
Empty {operationName}s bring no functionality and are misleading to others as they might think the {operationName} implementation fulfills a specific and identified requirement.

Such {operationName}s should be avoided and possibly removed.

include::{emptyCode}[]

However, there are some cases where a {operationName} needs to be empty without logic. In those cases, it is essential to minimize confusion and enhance clarity.

Here are a few examples:

* The {operationName} implementation will never be done.
+
--
include::{notsupportedCode}[]
--
* The {operationName} implementation will be done in the future.
+
--
include::{notimplementedCode}[]
--
* The {operationName} implementation is empty intentionally.

include::{commentCode}[]
