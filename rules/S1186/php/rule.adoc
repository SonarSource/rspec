== Why is this an issue?

There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:

* It is an unintentional omission and should be fixed to prevent unexpected behavior in production.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case an ``++UnsupportedOperationException++`` should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
public function doSomething() {
}

public function doSomethingElse() {
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
public function doSomething() {
  // Do nothing because of X and Y.
}

public function doSomethingElse() {
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}
----

=== Exceptions

Empty methods in abstract classes

[source,php]
----
abstract class Animal {
  public function speak() {}  // default implementation ignored
}
----
