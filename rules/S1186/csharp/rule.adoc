== Why is this an issue?

There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:


* It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case a ``++NotSupportedException++`` should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public override void DoSomething() 
{
}

public override void DoSomethingElse() 
{
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public override void DoSomething() 
{
  // Do nothing because of X and Y.
}

public override void DoSomethingElse() 
{
  throw new NotSupportedException();
}
----

=== Exceptions

The following methods are ignored:

* empty ``++virtual++`` methods,
* empty methods that override an ``++abstract++`` method,
* empty overrides in test assemblies.

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] I believe this rule could also apply to local functions and to property setters, right?

----
public void Method()
{
  void EmptyLocalFunction {} // Noncompliant
}

public int Property
{
  set {} // Noncompliant
}

\[~andrei.epure] Yes. We already do it for nested functions in python. I don't see any reason to not do the same for C#.
