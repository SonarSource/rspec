There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:


* It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case a ``++NotSupportedException++`` should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public override void DoSomething() 
{
}

public override void DoSomethingElse() 
{
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public override void DoSomething() 
{
  // Do nothing because of X and Y.
}

public override void DoSomethingElse() 
{
  throw new NotSupportedException();
}
----

== Exceptions

The following methods are ignored:

* empty ``++virtual++`` methods,
* empty methods that override an ``++abstract++`` method,
* empty overrides in test assemblies.
