=== Exceptions

The following empty methods are considered compliant:

* Empty `virtual` methods as the implementation might not be required in the base class.
* Empty methods that override an `abstract` method as the implementation is mandatory for child class
* Empty overrides in test assemblies for mocking purposes.

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] I believe this rule could also apply to local functions and to property setters, right?

public void Method()

  void EmptyLocalFunction {} // Noncompliant
}

public int Property

  set {} // Noncompliant
}

\[~andrei.epure] Yes. We already do it for nested functions in python. I don't see any reason to not do the same for C#.
