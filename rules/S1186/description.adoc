An empty {operationName} is generally considered bad practice and can lead to confusion, readability, and maintenance issues.
Empty {operationName}s bring no functionality and are misleading to others as they might think the {operationName} implementation fulfills a specific and identified requirement.

There are several reasons for a {operationName} not to have a body:

* It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed to prevent an unexpected behavior in production.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case an exception should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.
