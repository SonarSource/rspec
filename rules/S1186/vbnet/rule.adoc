=== Exceptions

The following empty methods are considered compliant:

* Empty `Overridable` or `MustOverride` methods, as the implementation might not be required in the base class.
* Empty methods that override a `MustOverride` method as the implementation is mandatory for child class
* Empty overrides in test assemblies for mocking purposes.
