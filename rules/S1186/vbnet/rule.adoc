There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:


* It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case a ``++NotSupportedException++`` should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Sub DoSomething()
End Sub

Function DoSomething() As String
End Function
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Sub DoSomething()
    ' Not implemented because of reason
End Sub

Function DoSomething() As String
    Throw New NotSupportedException
End Function
----

== Exceptions

The following methods are ignored:

* empty ``++Overridable++`` or ``++MustOverride++`` methods,
* empty methods that override an ``++MustOverride++`` method,
* empty overrides in test assemblies.
