=== Exceptions

The following empty methods are considered compliant:

* empty `Overridable` or `MustOverride` methods, as the implementation might not be required in the base class
* empty methods that override a `MustOverride` method as the implementation is mandatory for child class
* empty overrides in test assemblies for mocking purposes
