Calling ``++COMMIT++`` or ``++ROLLBACK++`` from within a trigger will lead to an ``++ORA-04092++`` exception, unless the trigger has its own autonomous transaction.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON

CREATE TABLE accounts(
  balance NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES(0);

CREATE TABLE log(
  message VARCHAR2(100)
);

CREATE TRIGGER beforeLogger
  BEFORE UPDATE ON accounts
  FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO log VALUES('Attempt to update the value from ' || :OLD.balance || ' to ' || :NEW.balance);
  COMMIT; -- Noncompliant, will fail with a ORA-04092
END;
/

-- We want to be able to log any attempt to update the "accounts" table
BEGIN
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = 100;
  ROLLBACK; -- Ultimately, this update is rolled back, however we still want to log it
END;
/

SELECT * FROM log;

DROP TRIGGER beforeLogger;

DROP TABLE log;

DROP TABLE accounts;
----


== Compliant Solution

----
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON

CREATE TABLE accounts(
  balance NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES(0);

CREATE TABLE log(
  message VARCHAR2(100)
);

CREATE TRIGGER beforeLogger
  BEFORE UPDATE ON accounts
  FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO log VALUES('Attempt to update the value from ' || :OLD.balance || ' to ' || :NEW.balance);
  COMMIT; -- Compliant, commits the trigger's autonomous transaction, not the main one
END;
/

-- We want to be able to log any attempt to update the "accounts" table
BEGIN
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = 100;
  ROLLBACK; -- Ultimately, this update is rolled back, however we still want to log it
END;
/

SELECT * FROM log;

DROP TRIGGER beforeLogger;

DROP TABLE log;

DROP TABLE accounts;
