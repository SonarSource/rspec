With the exception of volatile variables, variables declared and used only once do not contribute to program computations. A use is either an assignment (explicit initialization) or a reference. 


These variables are essentially noise but their presence may indicate that the wrong variable has been used elsewhere. Missing statements contribute to this problem.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
const int16_t x = 19; // Compliant, initialized and read
const int16_t y = 21; // Noncompliant, initialized but never read

void usedonlyonce ( void )
{
  int16_t once_1 = 42; // Noncompliant, initialized but never read
  int16_t once_2;
  once_2 = x ; // Noncompliant, assigned but never read
}
