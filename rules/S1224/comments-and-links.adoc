This description says that in the case of a member name matching a method name, the member should be renamed. However, the non-compliant example shows a member that name-clashes with a private method.


In this case, I would be tempted to rename the method - particularly because it's private. Should the method in the examples be made public?

This rule is not valuable as it will trigger lots of violations on fluent APIs:


----
class ClassTree {
  private final String name;  // There really is no problem here

  public String name() {      // There really is no problem here
    return name;
  }
}

Class names and fields/method should never collide because of naming conventions. (although they might collide when compared case insensitively)
