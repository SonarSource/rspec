Having a duplication between a field name and a method name is confusing, misleading, and probably an indication that the field name should be updated to be more meaningful. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
public class Foo {
  public int sum;         // Noncompliant, matching sum() method name
  public int sum() {...}
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public class Foo {
  public int sumTotal;    // Compliant
  public int sum() {...}
}

----
