Consider ignoring static imports of all capital letters (constants) when processing this rule.  It can be less confusing to statically import constants from other classes than to specify the class name first.  This is especially true when writing code that use Jooq (or other libraries) which regularly use constants for defining tables, columns, and other DB objects.
