Disabling builder sandboxes can lead to unauthorized access of the host system
by malicious programs.

By default, programs that are executed by a `RUN` instruction are in a sandbox
mode that limits the capabilities of the according process. Explicitly disabling
the sandbox grants the process additional capabilities that might allow the
process to escalate privileges and access the host system.
