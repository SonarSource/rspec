Disabling builder sandboxes can lead to unauthorized access of the host system
by malicious programs.

By default, programs that are executed by a `RUN` instruction are in a sandbox
mode that limits the capabilities of the process being executed. Explicitly
disabling the sandbox grants the process additional capabilities that might
allow it to escape the container and access the host system.
