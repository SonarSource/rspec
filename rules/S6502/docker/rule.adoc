Disabling builder sandboxes can lead to unauthorized access of the host system
by malicious programs.

By default, programs executed by a `RUN` statement use only an allowlist of
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html[capabilities] which
is considered safe: this is called `sandbox` mode.

If you disable the sandbox with the `--security=insecure` option, the command
can use the full set of Linux capabilities. +
This can lead to a container escape. For example, an attacker with the
`SYS_ADMIN` capability is able to mount devices from the host system.

This allows an attacker who controls the behavior of the ran command to access
the host system, break out of the container and penetrate the infrastructure.

After a successful intrusion, the underlying systems are exposed to:

* Theft of intellectual property and/or personal data
* Extortion
* Denial of services
== Ask Yourself Whether

* The program is controlled by an external entity.
* The program is part of a supply chain that could be a victim of a supply chain attack.

There is a risk if you answered yes to either of these questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Whenever possible, the sandbox should stay enabled to reduce unnecessary risk.
* If elevated capabilities are absolutely necessary, make sure to verify the integrity of the program before executing it.
