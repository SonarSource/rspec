== Why is this an issue?

Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides a secure channel between systems communicating over the internet by encrypting the data sent between them. HTTPS uses TLS on top of HTTP to build a secure communication channel.

This secure protocol is essential for the confidentiality and integrity of the communication during supply chain operations. This includes fetching dependencies with the Swift Package Manager (`swift package resolve`, `swift package update`, etc.).

The `Package.swift` manifest file defines the dependencies of a project for the Swift Package Manager. When declaring a package dependency, a URL to its Git repository is specified.

Using the unencrypted HTTP protocol for package dependencies is not generally recommended. It makes the build process vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which could lead to using compromised dependencies. It is important that HTTPS is used for these repository URIs instead.

== How to fix it

Replace insecure `http` URI schema with `https`.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyLibrary",
    platforms: [
        .macOS(.v10_15),
    ],
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "http://example.com/my-dependency", from: "1.0.0")  // Noncompliant
    ],
    // ...
)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,swift,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyLibrary",
    platforms: [
        .macOS(.v10_15),
    ],
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://example.com/my-dependency", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    // ...
)
