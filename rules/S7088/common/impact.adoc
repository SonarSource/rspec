=== What is the potential impact

==== Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks

An attacker can intercept the communication between the client and server, allowing them to modify the data being transmitted.

==== Supply chain attacks

Without the verification provided by TLS certificates, attackers can redirect package requests to malicious servers that mimic legitimate package repositories. 

For example, an attacker could inject malicious code into a package being downloaded, which would compromise the security of the application being built.

This can cause further security breaches inside the organization, but will also affect clients if the malicious code gets added to any products, as a part of a production dependency or as code generated by a tampered development dependency.

Distributing code that (unintentionally) contains backdoors or malware can lead to widespread security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.

==== Credential exposure

Sensitive information, such as API keys or user credentials used to interact with the remote package repository, could be exposed during transmission. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application or its data.
