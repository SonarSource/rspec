== Why is this an issue?

Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides a secure channel between systems communicating over the internet by encrypting the data sent between them. TLS can be used with `http` and `git` URI schemes to build secure `https` and `git+https` channels respectively. 

These secure protocols are essential for the confidentiality and the integrity of the communication performed when supply chain operations are performed, such as `dart pub get`, `flutter pub get`, `dart pub upgrade`, etc.

In the https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec[`pubspec.yaml` file], which is a file used by several Dart/Flutter commands, there's a possibility to specify URIs in various attributes: homepage, repository, issue_tracker, dependency repositories, etc. 

It is important that secure schemes are used in all these URIs. The protocol used in the `https` scheme provide an additional layer of security by encrypting the transferred data and verifying the server's identity.

It is generally recommended not to use `http` or `git` URIs that will be used by Dart/Flutter commands to gather external data during any stage of the application build.

=== What is the potential impact

==== Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks

An attacker can intercept the communication between the client and server, allowing them to modify the data being transmitted.

==== Supply chain attacks

Without the verification provided by HTTPS certificates, attackers could redirect package requests to malicious servers that mimic legitimate package repositories. 

For example, an attacker could inject malicious code into a Dart package being downloaded, which could compromise the security of the application being built.

This can cause further security breaches inside the organization, but will also affect clients if the malicious code gets added to any products, as a part of a production dependency or as code generated by a tampered development dependency.

Distributing code that (unintentionally) contains backdoors or malware can lead to widespread security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.

==== Credetials exposure

Sensitive information, such as API keys or user credentials used to interact with the remote repository of Dart/Flutter packages, could be exposed during transmission. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application or its data.

== How to fix it

Replace unsecure `http` or `git` URI schemas with `https`.
