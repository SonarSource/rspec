When a class implements the ``++IEquatable<T>++`` interface, it enters a contract that, in effect, states "I know how to compare two instances of type T or any type derived from T for equality.". However if that class is derived, it is very unlikely that the base class will know how to make a meaningful comparison. Therefore that implicit contract is now broken.


Alternatively ``++IEqualityComparer<T>++`` provides a safer interface and is used by collections or ``++Equals++`` could be made ``++virtual++``.


This rule raises an issue when a unsealed, ``++public++`` or ``++protected++`` class implements ``++IEquitable<T>++`` and the ``++Equals++`` is neither ``++virtual++`` nor ``++abstract++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  class Base : IEquatable<Base> // Noncompliant
  {
    bool Equals(Base other) 
    {
      if (other == null) { return false };
      // do comparison of base properties
    }

    override bool Equals(object other)  => Equals(other as Base);
  }

  class A : Base 
  {
    bool Equals(A other) 
    {
      if (other == null) { return false };
      // do comparison of A properties
      return base.Equals(other);
    }

    override bool Equals(object other)  => Equals(other as A); 
  }

  class B : Base 
  {
    bool Equals(B other) 
    {
      if (other == null) { return false };
      // do comparison of B properties
     return base.Equals(other); 
    }

    override bool Equals(object other)  => Equals(other as B);
  }

  static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    B b = new B();

    Console.WriteLine(a.Equals(b)); // This calls the WRONG equals. This causes Base::Equals(Base)
    //  to be called which only compares the properties in Base and ignores the fact that 
    // a and b are different types. In the working example A::Equals(Object) would have been 
    // called and Equals would return false because it correctly recognizes that a and b are 
    // different types. If a and b have the same base properties they will  be returned as equal. 
  }
}

== Compliant Solution

----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
    public sealed class Foo : IEquatable<Foo>
    {
        public bool Equals(Foo other) 
        {
            // Your code here        
        }
    }
}
