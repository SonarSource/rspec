This rule raises an issue when code creates a new Date object just to get the current timestamp as a number.

== Why is this an issue?

Creating a `Date` object and then immediately converting it to a number is unnecessarily verbose and inefficient. JavaScript provides `Date.now()` as a direct way to get the current timestamp.

When you write `new Date().getTime()` or similar patterns, you are:

* Creating an unnecessary object instance
* Using more memory than needed
* Writing more code than necessary
* Making the intent less clear

The `Date.now()` method was specifically designed for this purpose. It returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC, which is exactly what these other patterns achieve but in a more direct way.

Patterns like `+new Date()` or `Number(new Date())` rely on JavaScript's type coercion, which can be confusing for other developers reading the code. These implicit conversions make the code harder to understand at first glance.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue affects code readability and performance. While the performance impact is minimal in most cases, using `Date.now()` is the standard, recommended approach that clearly expresses the intent to get the current timestamp.

=== How to fix?


Replace `new Date().getTime()` with `Date.now()` to get the current timestamp more efficiently.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const timestamp = new Date().getTime(); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const timestamp = Date.now();
