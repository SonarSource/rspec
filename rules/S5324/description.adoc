Storing data locally is a common task for mobile applications. Such data includes files among other things. One convinient way to store files is to use the external file storage which usualy offer a larger amount of disc space compared to internal storage. 

Files created on the external storage are globally readable and writable. Therefore, a malicious application having the permissions `+WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE+` or `+READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE+` could try to read sensitive informations from the files that other application have stored on the external storage. 

External storage can also be removed by the user (e.g when based on SD card) making the files unavailable to the application.
