* Only use external storage if you need to share non-sensitive files with other applications.
* If your application have to use the external storage to store sentitive data, make sure it encrypts the files using https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedFile[EncryptedFile].
* Data comming from external storage should always be considered untrusted and should be validated.
* As some extrernal storage support can be removed, make sure to never store files that are critical for the usability of your application into it.
