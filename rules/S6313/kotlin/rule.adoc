Instead of exposing suspending functions to perform some piece business logic, `ViewModel` classes should prefer creating coroutines. Views should not be responsible for directly triggering coroutines. This allows for easier testing of your application, as `ViewModel` classes can be unit tested, whereas views require instrumentation tests.

Please refer to the https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-best-practices#viewmodel-coroutines[Android docs] for more advanced examples and mechanisms of updating the views with data generated asynchronously.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    suspend fun performAction() = suspendingWorker()
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    fun performAction() =
        viewModelScope.launch {
            suspendingWorker()
        }
}
----
