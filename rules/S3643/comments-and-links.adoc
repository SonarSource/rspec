I don't agree with:

____the use of a wildcard without the use of LIKE must also be an error.____

Such cases can be intentional and we should not raise a "bug" for them.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] are you saying that if I search for "foo*" without ``++LIKE++`` then I'm expecting a literal asterisk?

\[~ann.campbell.2] "%" is a wildcard, not "*".

This RSPEC has 2 cases:

* ``++LIKE 'foo'++`` has definitely a problem because 'foo' has no wildcard. Whether it's a bug or a code smell is debatable.
* ``++= 'foo%'++`` may be a valid condition, "%" is not a really strange character. Should we raise a bug on ``++= '100%'++``? I think that we may raise a code smell but not a bug.

Sounds like we need to split the rule [~pierre-yves.nicolas]. You want to start the Rule dogfood thread?

\[~ann.campbell.2] This rule seems to find a lot of issues on T-SQL projects. That makes the classification as "major bug" hard to justify. I created a T-SQL subtask to make it "minor". Another possibility is to change the rule to a code smell for all languages. Any opinion?
