Race conditions can happen when file operations and their associated pre-checks
are disconnected. Indeed, while the application assumes that the checked file
property will not change before performing the operation, there is a chance that
changes are applied to the file.

Especially, a concurrent process, which an attacker can control, could modify a
file right after a check is performed and before the actual use. This file can
be deleted, created, altered, or see its permissions changed depending on the
use case.
