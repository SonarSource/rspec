==== Arbitrary code execution

Executable or script file integrity and authenticity checks can be bypassed when
exploiting a TOCTOU vulnerability. In such a scenario, attackers would change
an executable file content between when its integrity is checked and when the
application executes it.

This attack would allow attackers to trick the application into executing
malicious, arbitrary code. They would then be granted the same privilege levels
as the application itself, which can be particularly severe when it runs with
administration privileges.
