==== Privileges escalation

When the attacker is a local user on the same server as the running application,
the same attack is possible with extended probability. In such a case, attackers
can exploit the reading and writing to configuration files, the creation of
local network resources, or the use of temporary files to achieve the same code
execution purpose.

However, in that case, the attack is only meaningful when the application is
running with high or otherwise interesting privileges. Attackers exploiting a
TOCTOU vulnerability that way would achieve horizontal or vertical privilege
escalation.
