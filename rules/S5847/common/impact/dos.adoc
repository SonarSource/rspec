==== Denial of service

When the application expects some file properties to be set at the operation
time, it will often face unexpected errors when those properties have actually
changed. This might be the case when writing to a file where newly set
permissions forbid that operation or when reading from a deleted file.

When such errors are faced, the application might unexpectedly stop, which can
affect its availability. Depending on the application and hosting architectures,
the interruption can be temporary or permanent, partial or complete.
