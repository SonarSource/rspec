To prevent TOCTOU race condition issues, best practices recommend relying on
file operations that can perform the necessary preliminary checks atomically.
For example, file opening functions usually accept a parameter to check the file
exists and return an error depending on the result. This check is atomic and is
not susceptible to race conditions. 

When this is not possible, it might be possible to open a file directly, and to
keep a reference to it for later use. If the conditions are set for the
subsequent operations, the application can continue with its processing and use
the open file pointer to read or write to the file.  In the opposite case, an
error might be raised that will need to be properly handled.

To finish, for most complex operations, the application can create a dedicated
working directory and set tight permissions on it. This needs to be performed
atomically to prevent further race conditions. All subsequent sensitive file
operations can then be performed in this dedicated directory.

Note that this last solution is imperfect and is still susceptible to race
condition attacks from privileged users and the application itself. It should be
used when no other countermeasure is acceptable.
