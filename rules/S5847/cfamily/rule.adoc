=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

The following code sample is susceptible to a race condition attack because it
checks a file exists strictly before it opens it for writing.

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
FILE *fopen_if_not_exists(const char *file) {
  if (access(file, F_OK) == -1 && errno == ENOENT) {
    FILE *f = fopen(file, "w"); // Noncompliant

    return f;
  }

  return nullptr;
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
FILE *fopen_if_not_exists(const char *file) {
  FILE *f = fopen(file, "wx");
  return f;
}
----

=== How does this work?

Here, the compliant code example uses an atomic operation to open the file and
check for its existence beforehand.
