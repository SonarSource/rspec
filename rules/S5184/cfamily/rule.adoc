== Why is this an issue?

The RAII idiom associates the lifetime of a resource with the lifetime of an object: The resource is acquired when the object is created, and released when it is destroyed.


If the object that controls the resource lifetime is a temporary, chances are it will get destroyed while the resource should still be in use, leading to resource corruption. This rule detects temporaries that look like RAII objects.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  scoped_lock{myMutex}; // Noncompliant. The mutex will be locked then immediately unlocked
  protectedCode(); // This code is not protected by the mutex
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  scoped_lock lock{myMutex}; // Compliant
  protectedCode();
  // The mutex is correctly released at this point
}
----
