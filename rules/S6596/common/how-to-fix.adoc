To avoid these issues, it is recommended to use specific version tags for images.

* Fixed Tags: Append the version number or tag to the image name.
For example, instead of using `my-image:latest`, it is better to use `my-image:1.2.3-alpine` or `my-image:1.2.3`.

* SHA of the image: SHA of the image can be used for even more control and traceability, it will ensure that the same image is used across different environments. For example, `my-image@sha256:1234567890abcdef`.
