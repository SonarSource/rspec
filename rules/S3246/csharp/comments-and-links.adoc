\[~ann.campbell.2] I think the description is okay. We could shorten it, but it's not necessary. ``++in++`` and ``++out++`` is not used too often, so it's not necessarily common knowledge.


I've modified the description a bit. ``++IComparer++`` is not the most notable example for ``++in++`` generic arguments. We haven't discussed this, but this rule also applies for delegates with generic parameters. And the most notable example for ``++in++`` is the ``++Action++`` delegate: \https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/018hxwa8(v=vs.110).aspx


A side note: the most notable example of having both ``++in++`` and ``++out++`` is probably the ``++Func<T, TResult>++`` delegate: \https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549151(v=vs.110).aspx

Thanks [~tamas.vajk]. Note that I've just worked covariant/contravariant into the description in the appropriate places. I suddenly realized we described them but didn't actually attach the descriptions to the words!
