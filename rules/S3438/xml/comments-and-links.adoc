The text of this issue needs to be tweaked. The original version included the "XMF ServiceProxy" terminology that only makes sense within my company. I've reworded it generally. Consider using this:


Left unset, the "reconnectOnException" property defaults to "false". As a result, even if the code that uses this Connection Factory (Spring's DefaultMessageListenerContainer or your own code) has reconnect logic that code won't work because the SingleConnectionFactory is acting like a single-connection pool by preventing connection "close" calls from actually closing anything. As a result subsequent factory "create" operations just hand back the original broken connection.
