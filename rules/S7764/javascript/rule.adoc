This rule raises an issue when code uses `window`, `self`, or `global` to access the global object, except for environment-specific APIs and events.

== Why is this an issue?

`globalThis` is the standardized way to access the global object across all JavaScript environments. Before `globalThis`, developers had to use different global references depending on the environment:

* `window` in browsers
* `global` in Node.js
* `self` in Web Workers

This created compatibility issues when code needed to run in multiple environments. Using environment-specific globals makes code less portable and harder to maintain.

`globalThis` was introduced in ES2020 as a unified solution that works consistently across all JavaScript environments. It provides the same global object reference regardless of whether your code runs in a browser, Node.js, or Web Worker.

Using `globalThis` makes your code more future-proof and eliminates the need for environment detection when accessing global properties.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using environment-specific global references reduces code portability and can cause runtime errors when code is moved between different JavaScript environments. This makes applications harder to maintain and test across different platforms.

=== How to fix?


Replace `window` with `globalThis` when accessing global properties or the global object itself.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const config = window.APP_CONFIG; // Noncompliant
window.myGlobalVar = 'value'; // Noncompliant

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const config = globalThis.APP_CONFIG;
globalThis.myGlobalVar = 'value';
