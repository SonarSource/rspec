The compiler is generally allowed to remove code that does not have any effect, according to the abstract machine of the C language. This means that if you have a buffer that contains sensitive data (for instance passwords), calling ``++memset++`` on the buffer before releasing the memory will probably be optimized away.


The function https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/memset[``++memset_s++``] behaves similarly to ``++memset++``, but the main difference is that it cannot be optimized away, the memory will be overwritten in all cases. You should always use this function to scrub security-sensitive data.


This rule raises an issue when a call to ``++memset++`` is followed by the destruction of the buffer.


Note that ``++memset_s++`` is defined in annex K of C11, so to have access to it, you need a standard library that supports it (this can be tested with the macro ``++__STDC_LIB_EXT1__++``), and you need to enable it by defining the macro ``++__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__++`` before including ``++<string.h>++``. Other platform specific functions can perform the same operation, for instance https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa366877(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN[SecureZeroMemory] (Windows) or https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=explicit_bzero[explicit_bzero] (FreeBSD)


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void f(char *password, size_t bufferSize) {
  char localToken[256];
  init(localToken, password);
  memset(password, ' ', strlen(password)); // Noncompliant, password is about to be freed
  memset(localToken, ' ', strlen(localBuffer)); // Noncompliant, localToken is about to go out of scope
  free(password);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void f(char *password, size_t bufferSize) {
  char localToken[256];
  init(localToken, password);
  memset_s(password, bufferSize, ' ', strlen(password));
  memset_s(localToken, sizeof(localToken), ' ', strlen(localBuffer));
  free(password);
}
