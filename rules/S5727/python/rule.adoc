== Why is this an issue?

Checking if a variable or parameter is ``++None++`` should only be done when you expect that it can be ``++None++``. Doing so when the variable is always None or never None is confusing at best. At worse, there is a bug and the variable is not updated properly.


This rule raises an issue when expressions ``++X is None++``, ``++X is not None++``, ``++X == None++`` or ``++X != None++`` are constant, i.e. ``++X++`` is always None or never None.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
mynone = None
result = mynone is None: # Noncompliant. Always True.

if mynone == None: # Noncompliant. Always True.
    pass

if mynone is not None:  # Noncompliant. Always False.
    pass

if mynone == None:  # Noncompliant. Always False.
    pass

myint = 42
result = myint is None: # Noncompliant. Always False.

if myint == None: # Noncompliant. Always False.
    pass

if myint is not None:  # Noncompliant. Always True.
    pass

if myint == None:  # Noncompliant. Always True.
    pass
