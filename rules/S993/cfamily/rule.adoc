== Why is this an issue?

Where a set of operators is overloaded, it is important that the interactions between the operators meet developer expectations.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class A
{
public:
  A& operator= ( A const & rhs );
};

A & operator += ( A const & lhs, A const & rhs );
A const operator + ( A const & lhs, A const & rhs )  // Noncompliant
{
  return lht -= rhs;
}
void f ( A a1, A a2 )
{
  A x;
  x = a1 + a2;
  a1 += a2;
  if ( x == a1 ) // This should be true, but it's not
  { 
  } 
}
