This rule raises an issue when an `import` or `export` declaration references a module or file that doesn't exist.

== Why is this an issue?

When you import a module that doesn't exist, your application will fail at runtime with a module resolution error. This commonly happens due to:

* Typos in module names or file paths
* Missing dependencies in `package.json`
* Incorrect relative paths to local files
* Modules that were moved or deleted

Catching these issues during static analysis prevents runtime failures and helps maintain code reliability. The rule validates both npm packages and local file imports to ensure all dependencies are properly available.

=== What is the potential impact?

Applications will crash at runtime when trying to load non-existent modules. This can cause complete application failures, especially if the missing import is in a critical code path that executes during startup.

=== How to fix?


Fix typos in module names and ensure the module exists. For npm packages, install the missing dependency. For local files, verify the path is correct.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import typoFile from "./typo-file";   // Noncompliant
import typoModule from "typo-module"; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import existingFile from "./existing-file";
import existingModule from "existing-module";
