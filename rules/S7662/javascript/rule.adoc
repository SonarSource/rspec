This rule raises an issue when `import` or `export` declarations reference modules that cannot be found in the file system or installed packages.

== Why is this an issue?

When you import a module that doesn't exist, your application will fail at runtime with a module resolution error. This commonly happens due to:

* Typos in module names or file paths
* Missing npm package installations
* Incorrect relative path references
* Deleted or moved files that are still being imported

Catching these issues during static analysis prevents runtime failures and helps maintain code reliability. The rule validates that all imported modules can be properly resolved, ensuring your application's dependencies are correctly configured.

=== What is the potential impact?

Applications will crash at runtime when trying to load non-existent modules. This can cause:

* Application startup failures
* Runtime errors during module loading
* Broken functionality when missing dependencies are accessed
* Deployment issues in production environments

=== How to fix?


Fix typos in module names and ensure the referenced modules exist. Install missing npm packages or correct file paths.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import typoFile from "./typo-file";   // Noncompliant
import typoModule from "typo-module"; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import existingFile from "./existing-file";
import existingModule from "existing-module";
