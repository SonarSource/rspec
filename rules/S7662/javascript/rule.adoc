This rule raises an issue when an `import` or `export` declaration references a module or file that does not exist in the file system or in the project's dependencies.

== Why is this an issue?

When you import a module that doesn't exist, your application will fail at runtime with a module resolution error. This commonly happens due to:

* Typos in file paths or module names
* Missing dependencies in package.json
* Incorrect relative paths
* Files that have been moved or deleted

Catching these issues early during development prevents runtime failures and improves code reliability. The rule validates that all imported modules can actually be resolved, ensuring your code will work as expected when executed.

=== What is the potential impact?

If imports reference non-existent modules, the application will crash at runtime with module resolution errors. This can cause:

* Application startup failures
* Broken functionality when the import is reached
* Poor user experience due to unexpected crashes
* Difficult debugging sessions to track down missing dependencies

=== How to fix?


Fix typos in import paths and ensure the referenced files exist. For relative imports, verify the file path is correct. For npm modules, ensure they are installed as dependencies.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import typoFile from "./typo-file";   // Noncompliant
import typoModule from "typo-module"; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import existingFile from "./existing-file";
import existingModule from "existing-module";
