Most modern applications use threads to handle incoming requests or other 
long-running tasks concurrently. In some cases, the number of concurrent threads
is limited to avoid system resource exhaustion due to too numerous actions
being run.

When an application uses user-controlled data as a parameter of a thread
suspension operation, a Denial of Service attack can be made possible.
