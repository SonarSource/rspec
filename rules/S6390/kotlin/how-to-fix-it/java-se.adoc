== How to fix it in Java SE

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
fun doGet(req: HttpServletRequest, resp: HttpServletResponse) {
  val time = req.getParameter("time").toLong()
  try {
    Thread.sleep(time) // Noncompliant
  } catch (e: InterruptedException) {
    resp.sendError(500)
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,kotlin,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import kotlin.math.min

//[...]
fun doGet(req: HttpServletRequest, resp: HttpServletResponse) {
  val time = req.getParameter("time").toLong()
  try {
    Thread.sleep(min(time, 1000))
  } catch (e: InterruptedException) {
    resp.sendError(500)
  }
}

=== How does this work?

In most cases, it is discouraged to define a thread suspension time from
user-input.

If really necessary, the application should ensure that the provided suspension
time is below a safe limit. Such a limit should be evaluated and set to the lowest
possible time that ensures the application's operation and restricts denial of service
attacks.

The example compliant code uses the `kotlin.math.min` function to ensure the suspension
duration is below the limit of one second.

Note that even when the suspension time is limited, an attacker who submits
numerous requests at high speed can still manage always to consume all available
threads.
