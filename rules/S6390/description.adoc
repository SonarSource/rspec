User provided data, such as URL parameters, POST data payloads, or cookies, are tainted with user-controlled inputs. Therefore, they should always be considered untrusted.
Using user-controlled data to define suspension time of threads execution could allow attackers to suspend thread execution for a long period of time.
Web-servers generally have a limited amoumt of threads that can run in parallel. With a few requests attackers can cause a Denial of Service, making the application unavailable for all users.
