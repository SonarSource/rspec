Any access to the file system can create a vulnerability. Exposing a file's content, path or even its existence or absence is dangerous. It is also extremely risky to create or write files without making sure that their permission and content is safe and controlled. Using a file path or reading a file content must be always done with caution as they could have been tampered with.

The file system is a resource which can be easily exhausted. Opening too many files will use up all file descriptors, preventing other software from opening files. Filling the storage space will also prevent any additional write from happening.

This rule flags code that initiates the use of files. The goal is to guide manual security code reviews.
