<p>It is a good practice to isolate test classes in a separate package so that what is shipped to production is neither polluted by nor bloated with them. Further, including unit tests in code assemblies could affect build processes.</p>

<p>\[~tamas.vajk] I noted "Project type for tests project?" as a possible rule. It does look like there is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182413%28v=vs.90%29.aspx">specific project type for tests</a>. I&#8217;m wondering if that shouldn&#8217;t be covered by this rule so that what this rule would check is not whether a test class is in a project with non-tests (meaning that a helper class would cause issues to be raised on all test classes?) but merely whether a test class is in a non-test-project project. WDYT?</p>

<p>\[~ann.campbell.2] This test project type is only used if you want to use the Microsoft test framework. If you are using NUnit, then a normal DLL project is sufficient. So I don&#8217;t think we can do anything about the test project type.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking a bit about this rule I don&#8217;t know how we could identify test assemblies and non-test ones. Currently we do two things to find out if a project is a test project or not:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the project name contains test, then it&#8217;s a test</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the project references a known test library, then it&#8217;s a test.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However this won&#8217;t help in identifying if you included a test accidentally in a non test assembly, because we would assume that the library is a test one as it has the necessary references. We could count the number of test and non-test classes and make a decision based on that. WDYT?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t know for C# but for Java, if the title would be "Tests should be contained in a dedicated source directory" instead of "Tests should be contained in a separate project" that would be perfect. cc [~ann.campbell.2] and [~tamas.vajk]</p>
