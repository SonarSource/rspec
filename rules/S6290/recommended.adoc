== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Only administrators should have access to the AWS credentials used by your application.

As a consequence, AWS credentials should not be stored along with the application code as they would grant special privilege to anyone who has access to the application source code.

Credentials should be stored outside of the code in a file that is never committed to your application code repository.

If possible, a better alternative is to use your cloud provider's service for managing secrets. On AWS this service is called https://aws.amazon.com/fr/secrets-manager/[Secret Manager].

When credentials are disclosed in the application code, consider them as compromised and revoke them immediately.
