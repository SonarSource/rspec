=== What is the potential impact?

A reCaptcha secret key is a unique alphanumeric token that is used to verify the
authenticity of reCaptcha requests made from an application to the reCaptcha
service. It is a key component in ensuring CAPTCHAs challenges issued by the
application are properly solved and verified.

If a reCaptcha secret key leaks to an unintended audience, attackers with access
to it will be able to forge CAPTCHA responses without solving them. It will
allow them to bypass the CAPTCHA challenge verification.

This can lead to an influx of spam submissions, automated attacks, or
unauthorized access attempts depending on the feature the CAPTCHA mechanism is
intended to protect.
