This rule raises an issue when template strings are used for simple string formatting instead of f-strings.

== Why is this an issue?

Template strings (t-strings) were introduced in Python 3.14 as a powerful feature for custom string processing. They evaluate to a `Template` object that can be processed by specialized functions for tasks like HTML templating, SQL query building, or structured logging.

However, when you only need simple string formatting without custom processing, f-strings are the more appropriate choice. F-strings directly evaluate to strings and are specifically designed for this use case.

Using template strings for simple formatting has several drawbacks:

* **Unnecessary complexity**: Template strings require explicit conversion to strings (using `str()` or a processing function), while f-strings produce strings directly.
* **Performance overhead**: Creating a `Template` object and then converting it to a string is less efficient than using an f-string.
* **Reduced readability**: The intent is less clear when using template strings for simple cases.
* **Inconsistent with Python conventions**: F-strings are the established standard for string interpolation in Python.

Template strings should be reserved for cases where you need to process the interpolated values in a custom way, such as HTML escaping, SQL parameter binding, or structured logging.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using template strings unnecessarily makes code less readable and maintainable. It also introduces a small performance overhead due to the creation of intermediate `Template` objects. While not a security issue, it represents a misuse of language features that can confuse other developers.

=== How to fix?


Replace the template string with an f-string. Remove any explicit string conversion calls like `str()` since f-strings already evaluate to strings.

----
name = "World"
result = str(t"Hello {name}")  # Noncompliant
