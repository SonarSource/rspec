== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, the semicolon (``++;++``) is optional as a statement separator, but omitting semicolons can be confusing, and lead to unexpected results because a semicolon is implicitly inserted at the end of each line.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
function fun() {
  return  // Noncompliant. ';' implicitly inserted at end of line
       5   // Noncompliant. ';' implicitly inserted at end of line
}
print(fun());  // prints "undefined", not "5"
