https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit[``++SystemExit++``]Â is raised when https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit[``++sys.exit()++``] is called. This exception is expected to propagate up until the application stops. It is ok to catch it when a clean-up is necessary but it should be raised again immediately.


A https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement[bare ``++except:++`` statement], i.e. an ``++except++`` without any exception class, is equivalent to https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException[``++except BaseException++``]. Both statements will catch every exception, including ``++SystemExit++``. It is recommended to catch instead a specific exception. If it is not possible, the exception should be raised again.


Note that it is also a good idea to reraise the https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt[``++KeyboardInterrupt++``] exception.


This rule raises an issue when a bare ``++except:++``, an ``++except BaseException++`` or an ``++except SystemExit++`` don't reraise the exception caught.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
try:
    open("foo.txt", "r")
except SystemExit:  # Noncompliant
    pass
except KeyboardInterrupt:  # No issue raised but be careful when you do this
    pass

try:
    open("bar.txt", "r")
except BaseException:  # Noncompliant
    pass
except:  # Noncompliant
    pass
----


== Compliant Solution

----
try:
    open("foo.txt", "r")
except SystemExit:
    # clean-up
    raise
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # clean-up
    raise

try:
    open("bar.txt", "r")
except BaseException as e:
    # clean-up
    raise e
except: # Noncompliant
    # clean-up
    raise

# or use a more specific exception

try:
    open("bar.txt", "r")
except FileNotFoundError:
    # process the exception
