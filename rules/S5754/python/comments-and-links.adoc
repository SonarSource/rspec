This rule is similar to RSPEC-2142 but this one is a code smell because python 2 forced developers to use a bare ``++except:++`` for a long time. Thus old projects will have many issues. Yet even in python 2 it is possible to handle properly the exception. Thus we raise a code smell issue for both python 2 and python 3.
