In programming languages keywords have a special meaning and are reserved to the language. It is hence a bad idea to define macros with keywords as macro identifier as it can easily lead to undefined behavior:

* The same object might be defined differently in different places, which violates the One Definition Rule
* If you include any header from the standard library, it is undefined behavior to define such macros

Additionally, it is very awkward for anyone reading the code to have a keyword that means something different.
