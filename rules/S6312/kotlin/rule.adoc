There are two ways to define asynchronous functions in Kotlin:

* using the modifier `suspend` in the function declaration
* creating an extension function on `CoroutineScope` (or passing it as a parameter)

The `suspend` modifier is generally used for functions that might take some time to complete. The caller coroutine might be potentially suspended.

Functions that return results immediately but start a coroutine in the background should be written as extension functions on `CoroutineScope`. At the same time, these functions should not be declared `suspend`, as suspending functions should not leave running background tasks behind.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
suspend fun CoroutineScope.f(): Int {
    val resource1 = loadResource1()
    val resource2 = loadResource2()
    return resource1.size + resource2.size
}
----

== Compliant Solution

Using `suspend`:
----
suspend fun f(): Int {
    val resource1 = loadResource1()
    val resource2 = loadResource2()
    return resource1.size + resource2.size
}
----

Using extension on `CoroutineScope`:
----
fun CoroutineScope.f(): Deferred<Int> = async {
    val resource1 = loadResource1()
    val resource2 = loadResource2()
    resource1.size + resource2.size
}
----
