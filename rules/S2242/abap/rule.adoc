== Why is this an issue?

``++SELECT INTO TABLE++`` is much more efficient than ``++SELECT ... ENDSELECT++``. ``++SELECT INTO TABLE++`` needs more memory to hold the result set, but in normal situations, this is not a concern. When memory is a concern, the result set can be divided into smaller sets.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
SELECT * FROM T006 INTO X006_WA.
  ...
ENDSELECT.
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,abap]
----
SELECT * FROM T006 INTO TABLE X006.
LOOP AT X006 INTO X006_WA.
  ...
ENDLOOP.
