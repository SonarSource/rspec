== Why is this an issue?

Variables that are never updated will always return their default values and so they should be explicitly declared as constant. A ``++let++``-declaration guarantees and clearly signals to the programmer that its value is supposed to and will never change.

This rule applies to non-constant fields and variables which are not set within the codebase.
