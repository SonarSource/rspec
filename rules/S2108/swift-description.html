<p>Variables that are never updated will always return their default values and so they should be explicitly declared as constant. A <code>let</code>-declaration guarantees and clearly signals to the programmer that its value is supposed to and will never change.</p>

<p>This rule applies to non-constant fields and variables which are not set within the codebase.</p>

<p>\[~nicolas.peru] we already have a separate rule about private fields: <a data-rspec-id="S1068" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-1068</a>, and because the advice is different. If they&#8217;re private and not used, they&#8217;re dead code. If they&#8217;re not private and <em>apparently</em> unused, they might still be accessed directly by classes that just aren&#8217;t currently 'visible'.</p>

<p>Moreover for me there is no intersection between this rule and rule <a data-rspec-id="S1068" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-1068</a>. In case of <a data-rspec-id="S1068" class="rspec-auto-link">RSPEC-1068</a> we&#8217;re looking for unused fields whereas here we&#8217;re looking for fields that ARE really used but never updated and so which should be declared as 'final'</p>

<p>I would decrease the remediation cost to 2 min and associate this rule to the Maintainability &gt; Understandability characteristic</p>
