== Why is this an issue?

Because ``++printf++`` format strings are interpreted at runtime, rather than validated by the compiler, they can contain errors that lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors. This rule statically validates the good behavior of ``++printf++`` formats.


The related rule S3457 is about errors that produce an unexpected string, while this rule is about errors that will create undefined behavior.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
printf("%d", 1.2); // Noncompliant, an "int" is expected rather than a "double"
printf("%d %d", 1); // Noncompliant, the second argument is missing
printf("%0$d ", 1); // Noncompliant, arguments are numbered starting from 1
printf("%1$d %d", 1, 2); // Noncompliant, positional and non-positional arguments can not be mixed
printf("%*d", 1.1, 2); // Noncompliant, field width should be an integer
printf("ab\0cd"); // Noncompliant, format string contains null char

int x;
printf("%+p", (void*)&x); // Noncompliant, flag "+" has undefined behavior with conversion specifier "p"
printf("%vd", x); //Noncompliant, conversion specifier "v" is not valid
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
printf("%f", 1.2); // Compliant, format is consistent with the corresponding argument
printf("%d", 1); // Compliant, number of specifiers is consistent with number of arguments
printf("%1$d ", 1); // Compliant, number of positional argument is consistent
----

=== Exceptions

This rule will only work if the format string is provided as a string literal.
