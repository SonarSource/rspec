== Why is this an issue?

Renaming imports, exports, or destructuring assignments to the same name is redundant and can be safely removed. You may accidentally end up with such code if you do a refactoring and change the local name in several places.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import { foo as foo } from "bar";
export { foo as foo };
let { foo: foo } = bar;
----

Fix your code to remove the unnecessary renaming.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import { foo } from "bar";
export { foo };
let { foo } = bar;
