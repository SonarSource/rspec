== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces a new text formatting API with the ``<format>`` header, in addition to the ``printf`` function family -- inherited from C -- and ``iostreams``.
``std::format`` combines the convenience of ``printf``, separating formatting and arguments, with the type-safety of ``iostreams``.
{cpp}23 adds the `<print>` header, which provides similar features that output to a stream instead of generating a string.

Before {cpp}20, if you wanted to format an output stream, you had to use standard manipulators that control the output streams.
This approach is very verbose, is often stateful, and is not thread-safe. That is why we recommend replacing them with ``std::print`` or ``std::format`` when possible.

Some manipulators will have a temporary effect on the output. For example, ``std::setw``. This is due to the resetting of the width property of the stream when most of the ``operator<<`` is called.
Other manipulators will have a lasting effect on the output. For example, ``std::boolalpha``. It will set the ``boolalpha`` flag of the output stream without resetting it.

This rule raises an issue when an output stream is used with standard manipulators to output a formattable type in a way that can be replaced by `std::print` or ``std::format``.
You should be careful to avoid undesirable side effects when replacing a manipulator with lasting effects.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void printBool(bool b) {
  std::cout << std::boolalpha << b; // Noncompliant
}

void printInt(int b) {
  std::cout << std::setfill('*') << std::setw(5) << b; // Noncompliant
}

int main() {
  printInt(10);
  printBool(true);
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void printBool(bool b) {
  // Compliant, be aware of the side effect of not setting the boolalpha flag
  std::print("{}", b);
  // Or, in C++20
  std::cout << std::format("{}", b);
}

void printInt(int b) {
  // Compliant, no side effect because setw has a temporary effect
  std::print("{:*>5}", b);
}

void setFlags() {
  // Compliant, the intention is to set the flags and not to output
  std::cout << std::boolalpha << std::showbase;
}

int main() {
  printInt(10);
  printBool(true);
  setFlags();
}

----

=== Exceptions

Manipulators that don't have a direct equivalent in the format library like ``std::quoted``, ``std::put_money``, etc.

[source,cpp]
----
void printQuoted(std::string_view s) {
  // Compliant by exception: no simple format-based alternative
  std::cout << std::quoted(s, '$', '-');
}
