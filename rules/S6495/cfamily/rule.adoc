== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduces a new text formatting API with the ``<format>`` header,
joining the ``printf`` family of functions -- inherited from C -- and ``iostreams``.
``std::format`` combines the convenience of ``printf``, separating formatting and
arguments, with the type-safety of ``iostreams``.

Before {cpp}20, if you wanted to format an output stream, you had to use standard manipulators that control the output streams.
This approach is very verbose, is often stateful, and is not thread-safe. That is why we recommend replacing them with ``std::format``
when possible.

Some manipulators will have a temporary effect on the output. For example, ``std::setw``. This is due to the resetting of the width property of the stream when most of the ``operator<<``is called.
Other manipulators will have a lasting effect on the output. For example, ``std::boolalpha``. It will set the ``boolalpha`` flag of the outputstream without resetting it.

This rule raises an issue when an output stream is used with standard manipulators to output a formattable type in a way that can be replaced by ``std::format``.
You should be careful to avoid undesirable side effects when replacing a manipulator with lasting effects.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void printBool(bool b) {
  std::cout << std::boolalpha << b; // Noncompliant
}

void printInt(int b) {
  std::cout << std::setfill('*') << std::setw(5) << b; // Noncompliant
}

int main() {
  printInt(10);
  printBool(true);
}
----
=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void printBool(bool b) {
  // Compliant, be aware of the side effect of not setting the boolalpha flag
  std::cout << std::format("{}", b);
}

void printInt(int b) {
  // Compliant, no side effect because setw has a temporary effect
  std::cout << std::format("{:*>5}", b);
}

void printQuoted(std::string_view s) {
  // Compliant, no simple format-based alternative
  std::cout << std::quoted(s, '$', '-');
}

void setFlags() {
  // Compliant, the intention is to set the flags and not to output
  std::cout << std::boolalpha << std::showbase;
}

int main() {
  printInt(10);
  printBool(true);
  printQuoted("10$");
  setFlags();
}

----

=== Exceptions

Manipulators that don't have a direct equivalent in the format library like ``std::quoted``, ``std::put_money``, etc.
