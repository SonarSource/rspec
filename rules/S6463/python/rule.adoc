Allowing unrestricted outbound communications can lead to data leaks.

When security group allow all outbound communications application or service within the security group can send data to any external IP address or port without restriction. If an resource within the security group becomes compromise attackers would be able to then send malicious traffic or exfiltrate data to external servers. This could happend even if the resource is not directly exposed to the internet, in case of a supply chain attack for example.

When deciding if outgoing connections should be limited, consider that limiting
the connections results in additional administration and maintenance work.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The resource has access to sensitive data.
* The resource is part of a private network.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

The principle of defence-in-depth and least privilege suggest that outbound connections should be restricted to a set of trusted destinations.
Therefore, for each security group, consider whether allowing all outbound connections is necessary. If not, disable it and add specific egress rules for the required outbound connections.

== Sensitive Code Example

For https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup.html[aws_cdk.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup]:

[source,python]
----
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)

ec2.SecurityGroup(  # Sensitive; allow_all_outbound is enabled by default
    self,
    "example",
    vpc=vpc
)
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup.html[aws_cdk.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup]:

[source,python]
----
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)

sg = ec2.SecurityGroup(
    self,
    "example",
    vpc=vpc,
    allow_all_outbound=False
)

sg.add_egress_rule(
    peer=ec2.Peer.ipv4("203.0.113.127/32"),
    connection=ec2.Port.tcp(443)
)
