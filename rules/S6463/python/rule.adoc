Allowing unrestricted outbound communications can lead to data leaks.

A restrictive security group is an additional layer of protection that might
prevent the abuse or exploitation of a resource. For example, it complicates the
exfiltration of data in the case of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

When deciding if outgoing connections should be limited, consider that limiting
the connections results in additional administration and maintenance work.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The resource has access to sensitive data.
* The resource is part of a private network.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to restrict outgoing connections to a set of trusted
destinations.


== Sensitive Code Example

For https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup.html[aws_cdk.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup]:

[source,python]
----
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)

ec2.SecurityGroup(  # Sensitive; allow_all_outbound is enabled by default
    self,
    "example",
    vpc=vpc
)
----

== Compliant Solution

For https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup.html[aws_cdk.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup]:

[source,python]
----
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)

sg = ec2.SecurityGroup(
    self,
    "example",
    vpc=vpc,
    allow_all_outbound=False
)

sg.add_egress_rule(
    peer=ec2.Peer.ipv4("203.0.113.127/32"),
    connection=ec2.Port.tcp(443)
)
----

* Make sure that allowing unrestricted outbound communications is safe here.
* Omitting "allow_all_outbound" enables unrestricted outbound communications. Make sure it is safe here.
