Allowing unrestricted outbound communications can lead to data leaks.

A restrictive security group is an additional layer of protection that might
prevent the abuse or exploitation of a resource. For example, it complicates the
exfiltration of data in the case of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

When deciding if outgoing connections should be limited, consider that limiting
the connections results in additional administration and maintenance work.
