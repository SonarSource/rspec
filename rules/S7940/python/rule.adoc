This rule raises an issue when parentheses are used around a single exception type in `except` or `except*` clauses, where they are not needed.

== Why is this an issue?

Starting with Python 3.14 and PEP 758, the language allows `except` and `except*` expressions to omit brackets around single exception types. Using unnecessary parentheses around single exception types creates visual clutter and inconsistency in your codebase.

When you write `except (ValueError):`, the parentheses serve no functional purpose since you're only catching one exception type. This is similar to how you wouldn't write `if (condition):` when a simple `if condition:` is clearer.

Parentheses are still required and meaningful when catching multiple exception types, such as `except (ValueError, TypeError):`. In this case, the parentheses group the exception types into a tuple, which is functionally necessary.

Consistent use of the cleaner syntax without unnecessary parentheses makes your exception handling more readable and aligns with modern Python style conventions introduced in Python 3.14.

=== What is the potential impact?

This is a style and consistency issue that does not affect the functionality of your code. However, maintaining consistent exception handling syntax improves code readability and follows modern Python conventions.

=== How to fix?


Remove the parentheses around single exception types in except clauses. Keep parentheses only when catching multiple exception types.

----
try:
    risky_operation()
except (ValueError):  # Noncompliant
    handle_error()

try:
    another_operation()
except* (RuntimeError):  # Noncompliant
    handle_error()

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
try:
    risky_operation()
except ValueError:
    handle_error()

try:
    another_operation()
except* RuntimeError:
    handle_error()

# Parentheses are still needed for multiple exceptions
try:
    complex_operation()
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    handle_multiple_errors()
