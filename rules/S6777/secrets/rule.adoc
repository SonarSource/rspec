Shippo is a multi-carrier shipping platform that helps businesses streamline their shipping processes. It provides a unified API and dashboard that allows businesses to connect with multiple shipping carriers. Shippo API tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes when making API requests.

== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

=== What is the potential impact?

If a Shippo API token is leaked, it can have several consequences:

==== Financial Loss

If the leaked API token is used to generate shipping labels or make shipping-related transactions, it can result in financial loss. Unauthorized individuals may exploit the token to generate fraudulent labels or make unauthorized shipments, leading to additional shipping costs or potential chargebacks.
==== Data Breach

If the leaked API token is associated with a user account that has access to sensitive customer or business data, it can result in a data breach. This can lead to the exposure of personal information, shipping addresses, payment details, or other confidential data, potentially causing harm to your customers and your business reputation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Shippo.setApiKey('shippo_live_258d9b4c41a8cb88ca7fb4b12c65083f658435ac'); // Noncompliant

HashMap<String, Object> addressMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();

addressMap.put("country", "US");
addressMap.put("phone", "+1 555 341 9393");

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Shippo.setApiKey(System.getenv("SHIPPO_API_TOKEN"));

HashMap<String, Object> addressMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();
addressMap.put("name", "Mr. Hippo");
addressMap.put("company", "Shippo");
addressMap.put("street1", "215 Clayton St.");
addressMap.put("city", "San Francisco");
addressMap.put("state", "CA");
addressMap.put("zip", "94117");
addressMap.put("country", "US");
addressMap.put("phone", "+1 555 341 9393");
addressMap.put("email", "support@goshipppo.com");
