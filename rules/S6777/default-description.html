<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shippo is a multi-carrier shipping platform that helps businesses streamline their shipping processes. It provides a unified API and dashboard that allows businesses to connect with multiple shipping carriers. Shippo API tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes when making API requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a Shippo API token is leaked, it can have several consequences:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial Loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the leaked API token is used to generate shipping labels or make shipping-related transactions, it can result in financial loss. Unauthorized individuals may exploit the token to generate fraudulent labels or make unauthorized shipments, leading to additional shipping costs or potential chargebacks.
==== Data Breach</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the leaked API token is associated with a user account that has access to sensitive customer or business data, it can result in a data breach. This can lead to the exposure of personal information, shipping addresses, payment details, or other confidential data, potentially causing harm to your customers and your business reputation.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
