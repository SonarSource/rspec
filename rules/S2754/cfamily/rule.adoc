== Why is this an issue?

Empty declarations are cruft; they (may) compile, but they violate the language standards, don't contribute anything of value, and clutter up the program. Like cobwebs, they should be swept away.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int;  // Noncompliant
----
