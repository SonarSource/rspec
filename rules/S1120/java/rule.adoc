==== Noncompliant code example

With an indent size of 2:

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Foo {
  public int a;
   public int b;   // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 4

...

  public void doSomething() {
    if(something) {
          doSomethingElse();  // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 6
  }   // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 4
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Foo {
  public int a;
  public int b;

...

  public void doSomething() {
    if(something) {
      doSomethingElse();
    }
  }
}

The parameter key is called ``++indentationLevel++`` in the current implementation. Changing the key would be a breaking change, so I am changing the RSPEC to match the implementation.
