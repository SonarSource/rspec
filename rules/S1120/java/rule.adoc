Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the code's readability. Consistent indentation among the developers within a team also reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier. 


This rule raises an issue when indentation does not match the configured value. Only the first line of a badly indented section is reported.

== Noncompliant Code Example

With an indent size of 2:

----
class Foo {
  public int a; 
   public int b;   // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 4

...

  public void doSomething() {
    if(something) {
          doSomethingElse();  // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 6
  }   // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 4
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
class Foo {
  public int a; 
  public int b; 

...

  public void doSomething() {
    if(something) {
        doSomethingElse();
    } 
  }
}
