== Why is this an issue?

Using object spread syntax makes the code more concise and readable compared to the `Object.assign()` method. The object spread syntax was introduced in ES2018 and allows shallow-cloning or merging of objects.

The `Object.assign()` also allows to mutate an object, which is not possible with the spread syntax, so the rule only applies to cases where the first argument of the `Object.assign()` is an object literal.

[source,javascript]
----
const a = Object.assign({}, foo); // Noncompliant
const b = Object.assign({}, foo, bar); // Noncompliant
const c = Object.assign({foo: 123}, bar); // Noncompliant
const d = Object.assign({}); // Noncompliant
----

To fix the code replace `Object.assign()` with a spread syntax.

[source,javascript]
----
const a = {...foo};
const b = {...foo, ...bar};
const c = {foo: 123, ...bar};
const d = {};
