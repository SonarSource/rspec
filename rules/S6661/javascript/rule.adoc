== Why is this an issue?

When merging objects or copying properties from one object to another, use object spread syntax instead of `Object.assign()`. Object spread syntax was introduced in ES2018 and allows shallow-cloning or merging of objects with a more concise and readable syntax.

The `Object.assign()` also allows to mutate an object, which is not possible with the spread syntax, so the rule only applies to cases where the first argument of the `Object.assign()` is an object literal.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const a = Object.assign({}, foo); // Noncompliant: Use spread syntax to clone or merge objects
const b = Object.assign({}, foo, bar); // Noncompliant: Use spread syntax to clone or merge objects
const c = Object.assign({foo: 123}, bar); // Noncompliant: Use spread syntax to clone or merge objects
const d = Object.assign({}); // Noncompliant: Use spread syntax to clone or merge objects
----

To fix the code replace `Object.assign()` with a spread syntax.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const a = {...foo};
const b = {...foo, ...bar};
const c = {foo: 123, ...bar};
const d = {};
