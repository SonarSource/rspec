Sometimes there is the need to cancel the execution of a coroutine after a given period of time. You can do this manually by combining the `delay()` and `cancel()` functions. However, this technique is verbose and error-prone. An easier way to manage timeouts is using the function `withTimeout()` or `withTimeoutOrNull()`.

The `withTimeout` function will throw a `TimeoutCancellationException` when the timeout is reached, while `withTimeoutOrNull` will simply return `null` instead.

This rule raises an issue if timeout mechanisms are implemented manually instead of using appropriate built-in functions.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
suspend fun main() {
    coroutineScope {
        val job = launch {
            delay(2000L)
            println("Finished")
        }
        delay(500L)
        job.cancel()
    }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
suspend fun main() {
    coroutineScope {
        withTimeoutOrNull(1000L){
            delay(2000L)
            println("Finished")
        }
    }
}
