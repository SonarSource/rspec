== Why is this an issue?

Each package in a Java project should include a ``++package-info.java++`` file. The purpose of this file is to document the Java package using javadoc and declare package annotations.


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
/**
* This package has non null parameters and is documented.
**/
@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault
package org.foo.bar;
