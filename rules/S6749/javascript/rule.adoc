== Why is this an issue?

React fragments are a feature in React that allows you to group multiple elements together without adding an extra DOM element. They are a way to return multiple elements from a component's render method without requiring a wrapping parent element.

However, a fragment is redundant if it contains only one child, or if it is the child of an HTML element.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<><Foo /></>;    // Noncompliant: The fragment has only one child
<p><>foo</></p>; // Noncompliant: The fragment is the child of the HTML element 'p'
----

You can safely remove the redundant fragment while preserving the original behaviour.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<Foo />;
<p>foo</p>;
----
