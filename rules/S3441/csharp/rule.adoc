When an anonymous type's properties are copied from properties or variables with the same names, it yields cleaner code to omit the new type's property name and the assignment operator.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cs]
----
var X = 5;

var anon = new 
{
  X = X, //Noncompliant, the new object would have the same property without the "X =" part.
  Y = "my string"
};
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cs]
----
var X = 5;

var anon = new 
{
  X,
  Y = "my string"
};
