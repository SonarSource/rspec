=== What is the potential impact?

Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) tokens allow applications to submit events to
a Splunk server for logging. A disclosed HEC token could allow an attacker to
submit fake events to Splunk.

Splunk API tokens allow applications to interact with a Splunk instance. Each
token represents a user and carries all of that user's rights. A disclosed token
could allow an attacker to perform any action on the Splunk instance that the
associated user could perform, from querying event data to administering the
Splunk instance or cluster.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting a disclosed token.
