`+private+` methods that are never executed are dead code: unnecessary, inoperative code that should be removed. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.

Note that this rule does not take reflection into account, which means that issues will be raised on `+private+` methods that are only accessed using the reflection API.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class Foo implements Serializable
{
  private Foo(){}     //Compliant, private empty constructor intentionally used to prevent any direct instantiation of a class.
  public static void doSomething(){
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    ...
  }
  private void unusedPrivateMethod(){...}
  private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream s){...}  //Compliant, relates to the java serialization mechanism
  private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in){...}  //Compliant, relates to the java serialization mechanism
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public class Foo implements Serializable
{
  private Foo(){}     //Compliant, private empty constructor intentionally used to prevent any direct instantiation of a class.
  public static void doSomething(){
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    ...
  }

  private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream s){...}  //Compliant, relates to the java serialization mechanism

  private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in){...}  //Compliant, relates to the java serialization mechanism
}
----

== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise any issue on annotated methods.
