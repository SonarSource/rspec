=== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise issues for:

* annotated methods
* methods with parameters that are annotated with one of the following:
  * `@javax.enterprise.event.Observes`
  * `@javax.enterprise.event.ObservesAsync`
  * `@jakarta.enterprise.event.Observes`
  * `@jakarta.enterprise.event.ObservesAsync`

The rule does not take reflection into account, which means that issues will be raised on `private` methods that are only accessed using the reflection API.
