== Why is this an issue?

A {operationName} that is never called is dead code, and should be removed. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.

This rule detects {operationName}s that are never referenced from inside a translation unit, and cannot be referenced from the outside.
