== Why is this an issue?

A function that is never called is dead code, and should be removed. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.

This rule detects functions that are never called from inside a translation unit, and cannot be called from the outside.
