This is an issue when `Time.zone.to_s` is used to get a timezone identifier for use with `ActiveSupport::TimeZone[]` or other timezone lookup operations.

== Why is this an issue?

The `Time.zone.to_s` method returns a formatted string that includes GMT offset information, such as `"(GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)"`. This formatted string cannot be used with `ActiveSupport::TimeZone[]` for timezone lookups, which expects the clean timezone identifier.

When you pass the result of `Time.zone.to_s` to `ActiveSupport::TimeZone[]`, it returns `nil` because the formatted string doesn't match any known timezone identifier. This can lead to unexpected `nil` values in your application, potentially causing errors or incorrect behavior in timezone-related operations.

The `Time.zone.name` method, on the other hand, returns the clean timezone identifier (like `"Pacific Time (US & Canada)"`) that works correctly with timezone lookup methods.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `Time.zone.to_s` for timezone lookups will result in `nil` values, which can cause:

* Runtime errors when the application expects a valid timezone object
* Incorrect timezone handling in date/time operations
* Silent failures where timezone-dependent features don't work as expected
* Difficult-to-debug issues in applications that rely on timezone conversions

== How to fix it in Rails

Replace `Time.zone.to_s` with `Time.zone.name` when you need the timezone identifier for lookups or storage.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
# This will return nil because to_s includes GMT offset
current_zone_string = Time.zone.to_s  # Noncompliant
timezone = ActiveSupport::TimeZone[current_zone_string]  # Returns nil
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
# Use name to get the clean timezone identifier
current_zone_name = Time.zone.name
timezone = ActiveSupport::TimeZone[current_zone_name]  # Works correctly
----

When directly passing the timezone to lookup methods, use `Time.zone.name` instead of `Time.zone.to_s`.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,ruby,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
# Direct usage that will fail
timezone = ActiveSupport::TimeZone[Time.zone.to_s]  # Noncompliant - returns nil
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,ruby,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
# Direct usage with the correct method
timezone = ActiveSupport::TimeZone[Time.zone.name]  # Works correctly
----
