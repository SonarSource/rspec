I believe that the default value for the regular expression is wrong.

From the example I understand you would put small case letters separated by ``++_++``, are you sure you don't want camel case style?

I personally prefer camelCase [~massimo.paladin] but set the default regex based on what I thought was the generally accepted standard for C/{cpp}. However, as I try to re-find what I based that off of, I'm coming up blank & coming instead to the conclusion that this is holy war territory. If you feel strongly, you can change the regex & flip the code samples. Just either update the RSpec or notify me to do so.

I would propose to use the same which is used for class names in RSPEC-101.

For {cpp} in practice for classes we have ``++[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+++``.


``++[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+++`` vs ``++[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*++`` I have not much strong preference.


If we agree I can modify the description.
