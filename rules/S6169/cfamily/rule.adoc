``++std::is_constant_evaluated++`` is used to determine whether or not a context is constant-evaluated. This can be useful when, for example, two different implementations are provided for an algorithm: one, usually slow, for compile-time and the other one, faster, for runtime.


However, some contexts are either always constant-evaluated or never constant-evaluated. In these cases, a call to ``++std::is_constant_evaluated++`` is unnecessary as it will always return the same result.

``++std::is_constant_evaluated++`` will always return ``++true++`` when called in:

* the condition of ``++if constexpr++``
* the condition of ``++static_assert++``
* ``++consteval++`` functions

And it will always return ``++false++`` in:

* non-``++constexpr++``/``++consteval++`` functions

This rule raises an issue when ``++std::is_constant_evaluated()++`` is called in an ``++if constexpr++`` or a ``++static_assert++`` condition, where it is always ``++true++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
  if constexpr (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {  // Noncompliant: will always be true
    // compile-time implementation
  } else {
    // runtime implementation
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {
    // compile-time implementation
  } else {
    // runtime implementation
  }
}
----
