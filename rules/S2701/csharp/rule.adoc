== Why is this an issue?

Using literal boolean values in assertions can lead to less readable and less informative unit tests.
When a test fails, it's important to have a clear understanding of what the test was checking and why it failed.
Most of the testing frameworks provide more explicit assertion methods that will provide a more helpful error message if the test fails.

=== Exceptions

`Assert.True` is not raising this issue for xUnit because `Assert.Fail` was introduced in 2020 version 2.4.2 and `Assert.True(false, message)` was a way to simulate it.
