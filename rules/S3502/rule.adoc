== Why is this an issue?

Having two methods in the same class with the same body is suspicious and potentially confusing. If it is due to a bad copy/paste, it should be fixed. If it's on purpose, it is clearer for the second method to simply call the first.


=== Noncompliant code example

----
public void doTheThing() {
  this.x = 4;
}

public void doTheOtherThing {  // Noncompliant
  this.x = 4;
}
