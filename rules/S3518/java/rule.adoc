If the denominator to an integer division or remainder operation is zero, a
`ArithmeticException` is thrown.

include::../introduction.adoc[]

== Why is this an issue?

A division (`/`) or remainder operation (`%`) by zero indicates a bug or logical
error.
This is because in Java, a division or remainder operation where the denominator
is zero and not a floating point value always results in an
`ArithmeticException` being thrown.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void test_divide() {
  int z = 0;
  if (unknown()) {
    // ..
    z = 3;
  } else {
    // ..
  }
  z = 1 / z; // Noncompliant, possible division by zero
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void test_divide() {
  int z = 0;
  if (unknown()) {
    // ..
    z = 3;
  } else {
    // ..
    z = 1;
  }
  z = 1 / z;
}
----

=== Exceptions

No issue is raised when the denominator is the constant zero, as it is considered an intentional failure.

When working with ``++double++`` or ``++float++`` values, no exception will be thrown, and the operation will result
in special floating point values representing either positive infinity, negative infinity, or `NaN`.
Thus, the rule does not apply to floating point division or remainder operations.

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

This rule supports primitive ``++int++``, ``++long++``, ``++double++``, and
``++float++`` values, as well as ``++BigDecimal++`` and ``++BigInteger++``.
