If the denominator to a division or modulo operation is zero it would result in a fatal error.


When working with ``++double++`` or ``++float++``, no fatal error will be raised, but it will lead to unusual result and should be avoided anyway.


This rule supports primitive ``++int++``, ``++long++``, ``++double++``, ``++float++`` as well as ``++BigDecimal++`` and ``++BigInteger++``.
