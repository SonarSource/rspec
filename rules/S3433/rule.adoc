A method is detected as test method if marked with one of the following attributes ``++[TestMethod]++`` or ``++[DataTestMethod]++`` (for mstest), ``++[Fact]++`` or ``++[Theory]++`` (for xunit) or ``++[Test]++``, ``++[TestCase]++``, ``++[TestCaseSource]++`` or ``++[Theory]++`` (for nunit). However, whether or not they have a test attribute, non-``++public++`` methods are not recognized as tests, and therefore not executed. Neither are ``++async++`` ``++void++`` methods, or methods with generics anywhere in their signatures. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
[TestMethod]
void TestNullArg()  // Noncompliant; method is not public
{  /* ... */  }

[TestMethod]
public async void MyIgnoredTestMethod()  // Noncompliant; this is an 'async void' method
{ /* ... */ }

[TestMethod]
public void MyIgnoredGenericTestMethod<T>(T foo)  // Noncompliant; method has generics in its signature
{ /* ... */ }
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
[TestMethod]
public void TestNullArg()
{  /* ... */  }
----


== Exceptions

Accessibility is ignored for xUnit ``++Fact++`` test methods, since they do not need to be ``++public++``.

``++[Theory]++`` test methods in xUnit and ``++[TestCase]++`` and ``++[TestCaseSource]++`` test methods in nunit can be generic.
