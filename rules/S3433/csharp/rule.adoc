== Why is this an issue?

A method is identified as a test method if it is marked with one of the following attributes:

* `[TestMethod]` or `[DataTestMethod]` (for *MSTest*).
* `[Fact]` or `[Theory]` (for *xUnit*).
* `[Test]`, `[TestCase]`, `[TestCaseSource]`, or `[Theory]` (for *NUnit*). 

However, non-`public` methods are not considered test methods and will not be executed, regardless of whether they have a test attribute.
Additionally, methods with the `async void` modifier or methods that contain generics `<T>` anywhere in their signatures are also excluded from being recognized as tests and will not be executed.

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
[TestMethod]
void TestNullArg()  // Noncompliant, method is not public
{  /* ... */  }

[TestMethod]
public async void MyIgnoredTestMethod()  // Noncompliant, this is an 'async void' method
{ /* ... */ }

[TestMethod]
public void MyIgnoredGenericTestMethod<T>(T foo)  // Noncompliant, method has generics in its signature
{ /* ... */ }
----

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
[TestMethod]
public void TestNullArg()
{  /* ... */  }

[TestMethod]
public async Task MyIgnoredTestMethod()
{ /* ... */ }

[TestMethod]
public void MyIgnoredGenericTestMethod(int foo)
{ /* ... */ }
----

=== Exceptions

For *xUnit*, accessibility is disregarded when it comes to `[Fact]` test methods, as they do not necessarily need to be declared as `public`.

In *xUnit*, `[Theory]` test methods, as well as `[TestCase]` and `[TestCaseSource]` test methods in *NUnit*, have the flexibility to be generic, allowing for a wider range of test scenarios.
