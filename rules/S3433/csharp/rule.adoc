== Why is this an issue?

A method is detected as test method if marked with one of the following attributes ``++[TestMethod]++`` or ``++[DataTestMethod]++`` (for *MSTest*), ``++[Fact]++`` or ``++[Theory]++`` (for *xUnit*) or ``++[Test]++``, ``++[TestCase]++``, ``++[TestCaseSource]++`` or ``++[Theory]++`` (for *NUnit*). However, whether or not they have a test attribute, non-``++public++`` methods are not recognized as tests, and therefore not executed. Neither are ``++async++`` ``++void++`` methods, or methods with generics anywhere in their signatures. 

A method is identified as a test method if it is marked with one of the following attributes:

* ``++[TestMethod]++ or ``++[DataTestMethod]++`` (for *MSTest*).
* ``++[Fact]++`` or ``++[Theory]++`` (for *xUnit*).
* ``++[Test]++``, ``++[TestCase]++``, ``++[TestCaseSource]++``, or ``++[Theory]++`` (for *NUnit*). 

However, non-public methods are not considered as tests and will not be executed, regardless of whether they have a test attribute. 
Additionally, methods with the _async void_ modifier or methods that contain generics _<T>_ anywhere in their signatures are also excluded from being recognized as tests and will not be executed.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
[TestMethod]
void TestNullArg()  // Noncompliant, method is not public
{  /* ... */  }

[TestMethod]
public async void MyIgnoredTestMethod()  // Noncompliant, this is an 'async void' method
{ /* ... */ }

[TestMethod]
public void MyIgnoredGenericTestMethod<T>(T foo)  // Noncompliant, method has generics in its signature
{ /* ... */ }
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
[TestMethod]
public void TestNullArg()
{  /* ... */  }

[TestMethod]
public void MyIgnoredTestMethod()
{ /* ... */ }

[TestMethod]
public void MyIgnoredGenericTestMethod(int foo)
{ /* ... */ }
----

=== Exceptions

For *xUnit*, accessibility is disregarded when it comes to ``++[Fact]++`` test methods, as they do not necessarily need to be declared as _public_.

In *xUnit*, ``++[Theory]++`` test methods, as well as ``++[TestCase]++`` and ``++[TestCaseSource]++`` test methods in *NUnit*, have the flexibility to be generic, allowing for a wider range of test scenarios.
