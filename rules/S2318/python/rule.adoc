This rule raises an issue when the inequality operator `<>` is used.

== Why is this an issue?

The operators ``++<>++`` and ``++!=++`` are equivalent. 
However, the `<>` operator is considered obsolete in Python 2.7 and
has been removed from Python 3. Therefore, it is recommended to use `!=` instead.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
return a <> b # Noncompliant: the operator "<>" is deprecated.
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
return a != b
----
