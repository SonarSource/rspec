== Why is this an issue?

The use of ``++strlen++`` to determine the length of a string to which you are trying to append a null character is an anti-pattern. ``++strlen++`` requires as input an already null-terminated string; the result of passing a non-null-terminated string as an input to ``++strlen++`` is undefined. It may even lead to a memory access violation.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  char *myStr;
  // ...
  myStr[strlen(myStr)] = '\0'; // Noncompliant, strlen requires an already null-terminated string
}
