If we raise false positives a possible exception would be:


=== Exceptions

No issue will be raised if the test class, i.e. the class annotated with ``++@isTest++``, contains helper methods, i.e. methods not annotated with ``++@isTest++`` or ``++testmethod++``, which contain calls to ``++Test.StartTest()++`` or ``++Test.StopTest()++``. This indicates that the test code has been factorised and the rule would raise false positives.

SONARSLANG-397 shows that, even with the exception above, we have a lot of issue, with potential false positives.


We decided to keep the rule, but remove it from the default quality profile.
