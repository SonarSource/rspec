If you throw a general exception type, such as ``++std::exception++``, ``++std::logic_error++`` or ``++std::runtime_error++``, it forces consumers to catch all exceptions, including unknown exceptions they don't necessarily know how to handle.

Instead, either throw a subtype that already exists ( for example in ``++<stdexcept>++`` ), or create your own type that derives from a standard one.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
throw std::logic_error("Unexpected null 'user_id' argument."); // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
throw std::invalid_argument("Unexpected null 'user_id' argument.");
----
