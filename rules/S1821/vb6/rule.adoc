== Why is this an issue?

Nested ``++Select Case++`` structures are difficult to understand because you can easily confuse the cases of an inner ``++Select Case++`` as belonging to an outer statement. Therefore nested ``++Select Case++`` statements should be avoided.


Specifically, you should structure your code to avoid the need for nested ``++Select Case++`` statements, but if you cannot, then consider moving the inner ``++Select Case++`` to another function.
