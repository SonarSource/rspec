== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++Object.ReferenceEquals++`` to compare the references of two value types simply won't return the expected results most of the time because such types are passed by value, not by reference.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class MyClass
{
  private MyStruct myStruct;

  public void DoSomething(MyStruct s1) {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 1;

    if (Object.ReferenceEquals(myStruct, s1))  // Noncompliant; this can never be true
    {
      // ...
    }
    else if (Object.ReferenceEquals(a,b)) // Noncompliant
    {
      // ...
    }
  }
}

Use a different kind of comparison for these value types.

\[~tamas.vajk] I'm a little confused about whether it should be ``++Object...++`` or ``++object...++``. I followed your lead, but am a little uncomfortable about the inconsistency in usage between title and code sample

LGTM, I've changed the ``++object++`` to ``++Object++`` just to conform to the title, but  there is no difference, because ``++object++`` is just an alias for ``++System.Object++``
