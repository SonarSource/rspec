== Why is this an issue?

``++SELECT++`` and ``++OMIT++`` allow you to choose records from a logical file based on the values of specific fields. SQL views allow you to make the same distinctions, but their use is more efficient, and easier to read and understand. Therefore views are preferred over ``++SELECT++`` and ``++OMIT++`` statements.

      A          R SKCOU                     TEXT('Coupon Rate Details')
