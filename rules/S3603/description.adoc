== Why is this an issue?

Marking a method with the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.contracts.pureattribute[`Pure`] attribute indicates that the method doesn't make any visible state changes. Therefore, a `Pure` method should return a result otherwise it indicates a no-operation call.

Using `Pure` on a `void` method is either by mistake or the method is not doing a meaningful task.
