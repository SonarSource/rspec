*Implementation details*:

*In .Net core*, -any reference to ``++Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpRequest.Cookies++`` should create an issue. It is a ``++IEnumerable++`` and it is not worth highlighting every manipulation method this class has. There is no "Cookie" Type in .Net Core, they are instead processed as strings.-

The ``++Request++`` object is just a reference to the ``++HttpRequest++`` of the current request.

Regarding ``++Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpResonse.Cookies++``, only the ``++Append++`` method should raise an issue as the ``++Delete++`` one is not security-sensitive (no risk of injection).

The ``++Response++`` object is just a reference to the ``++HttpResponse++`` of the current request.
