``++java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock++`` offers far more powerful and flexible locking operations than are available with ``++synchronized++`` blocks. So synchronizing on a ``++Lock++`` throws away the power of the object, and is just silly. Instead, such objects should be locked and unlocked using ``++tryLock()++`` and ``++unlock()++``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Lock lock = new MyLockImpl();
synchronized(lock) {  // Noncompliant
  //...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
Lock lock = new MyLockImpl();
lock.tryLock();
//...
----
