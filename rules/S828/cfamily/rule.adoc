It is undefined behaviour if an identifier is used for which multiple definitions exist (in different translation units) or no definition exists at all. With the exception of templates and inline functions, multiple definitions in different translation units are not permitted, even if the definitions are the same.

// file1.cpp
int32_t i = 0;
