The requirement for a final ``++case _++`` clause is defensive programming. The clause should either take appropriate action, or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
param match {
  case 1 => doSomething
  case 2 => doSomethingElse
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
param match {
  case 1 => doSomething
  case 2 => doSomethingElse
  case _ => throw new IllegalArgumentException(s"Unexpected param: $param")
}
