== Why is this an issue?

The requirement for an ``++OTHERS++`` clause is defensive programming. The clause should either take appropriate action, or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,abap]
----
CASE SY-INDEX.   // Noncompliant; missing WHEN OTHERS clause
  WHEN ONE.
    WRITE  'One'. 
  WHEN 2.
    WRITE   'Two'.
ENDCASE.
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,abap]
----
CASE SY-INDEX. 
  WHEN ONE.
    WRITE  'One'. 
  WHEN 2.
    WRITE   'Two'.
  WHEN OTHERS. // Compliant
    WRITE 'Unexpected result'
ENDCASE.

CASE SY-INDEX.
  WHEN OTHERS.   // Compliant
    WRITE 'Unexpected result'
  WHEN ONE.
    WRITE  'One'. 
  WHEN 2.
    WRITE   'Two'.
ENDCASE.
