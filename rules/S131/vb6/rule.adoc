== Why is this an issue?

The requirement for a final ``++Case Else++`` clause is defensive programming. The clause should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. Even when the ``++Select++`` covers all current values of an ``++enum++``, a ``++Case Else++`` case should still be used because there is no guarantee that the ``++enum++`` won't be extended.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vb6]
----
Dim number As Integer = 8
Select Case number   'Non-Compliant, what to do when number is not between 1 and 10 ?
    Case 1 To 5
        Debug.WriteLine("Between 1 and 5, inclusive")
        ' The following is the only Case clause that evaluates to True.
    Case 6, 7, 8
        Debug.WriteLine("Between 6 and 8, inclusive")
    Case 9 To 10
        Debug.WriteLine("Equal to 9 or 10")
End Select

Dim number As Integer = 8
Select Case number
    Case 1 To 5
        Debug.WriteLine("Between 1 and 5, inclusive")
        ' The following is the only Case clause that evaluates to True.
    Case 6, 7, 8
        Debug.WriteLine("Between 6 and 8, inclusive")
    Case 9 To 10
        Debug.WriteLine("Equal to 9 or 10")
    Case Else
        Debug.WriteLine("Greater than 10")
End Select
