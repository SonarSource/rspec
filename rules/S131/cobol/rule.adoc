The ``++EVALUATE++`` statement allows implementing case structures in Cobol. Each case is managed by a ``++WHEN++`` phrase activated by specific test of a variable.The ``++WHEN OTHER++`` phrase allows managing all the cases which have not been taken into account by the previous ``++WHEN++`` phrases. If the variable to be tested contains a new value that is not currently managed then the absence of the ``++WHEN OTHER++`` phrase will lead a situation in which no process will be performed for this value and the program may have uncontrolled or undefined behavior.
