This rule raises an issue when `pytorch.load` is used to load a model.

== Why is this an issue?

Under the hood, `torch.load` uses the `pickle` library to load the model and the weights. 
If the model comes from an untrusted source, an attacker could inject a malicious payload which would be executed during the deserialization.

== How to fix it
Use a safer alternative to load the model, such as `safetensors.torch.load_model`.
=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import torch

model = torch.load('model.pth') # Noncompliant: torch.load is used to load the model
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import torch
import safetensors

model = MyModel()
safetensors.torch.load_model(model, 'model.pth')
----
