Character classes in regular expressions are a convenient way to match one of several possible characters by listing the allowed characters or ranges of characters. If a character class contains only one character, the effect is the same as just writing the character without a character class.

Thus, having only one character in a character class is usually a simple oversight that remained after removing other characters of the class.
