== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Disable application backup unless it is required for your application to work properly.
* Narrow the scope of backed-up files by using either
** backup rules (see ``++android:fullBackupContent++`` attribute).
** a custom ``++BackupAgent++``.
** the dedicated `no_backup` folder (see ``++android.content.Context#getNoBackupFilesDir()++``).
* Do not back up local data containing sensitive information unless they are properly encrypted.
* Make sure that the keys used to encrypt backup data are not included in the backup.
* Validate data from backed-up files. They should be considered untrusted as they could have been restored from an untrusted source.
