Classes subclassing ``++unittest.TestCase++`` are considered test cases. Methods within the class will be discovered by the test runner if their name starts with \"``++test++``". If a method intended to be a test does not respect this convention, it will not be executed.


This rule raises an issue when a method is not discoverable as a test and is never used within its test case class.


This rule will not raise if:

* The method is called directly from another method.
* The method overrides an existing one in ``++unittest.TestCase++``  (example: ``++a tearDown++`` method).
