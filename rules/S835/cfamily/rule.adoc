== Why is this an issue?

ISO/IEC 14882:2003 [1] requires initializer lists for arrays, structures and union types to be enclosed in a single pair of braces (though the behaviour if this is not done is undefined). The rule given here goes further in requiring the use of additional braces to indicate nested structures.

This forces the developer to explicitly consider and demonstrate the order in which elements of complex data types are initialized (e.g. multi-dimensional arrays).

A similar principle applies to structures, and nested combinations of structures, arrays and other types.



=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct Pod {
  int x;
  int y;
};

struct PodPair {
  Pod first;
  Pod second;
};

int a1[3][2] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }; // Noncompliant
Pod a2[2] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; // Noncompliant
PodPair a3 = { 1, 2 }; // Noncompliant, also missing initializers for `a3.second`
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int a1[3][2] = { {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6} }; // Compliant
Pod a2[2] = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} }; // Compliant
PodPair a3 = { {1, 2}, {} }; // Compliant
----

FYI [~samuel.mercier] I've switched this to Understandability, since it talks about forcing the programmer to explicitly show her intentions.


Also, I've unified all the text under the initial description. Every once in a while, there's a call to have text outside of the description (not counting the Exceptions section) but it's very rare and the standard is that all the text goes at the top.

I believe that examples with structures should be added.
