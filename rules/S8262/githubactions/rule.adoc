== Why is this an issue?

By default, `actions/checkout` persists (`persist-credentials=true`) the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `.git/config` as `http.https://github.com/.extraheader`. When artifacts are uploaded using `actions/upload-artifact` that include the `.git` directory, these persisted credentials can be exposed, even though GitHub's log redaction masks tokens in workflow logs.

The vulnerability occurs when:

* **Upload-artifact version < 4.4**: When `persist-credentials` is `true` or not set (defaults to `true`) in `actions/checkout` version > 4.4, credentials are persisted to `.git/config`. If `actions/upload-artifact` is used, without explicitly excluding `.git/`, the persisted credentials in `.git/config` can be included in produced artifacts.

* **Upload-artifact version >= 4.4**: When `persist-credentials` is `true` or not set (defaults to `true`) in `actions/checkout` version >= 4.4, and `include-hidden-files: true` is used in `actions/upload-artifact` without explicitly excluding `.git/`, the persisted credentials in `.git/config` can be included in produced artifacts.

=== What is the potential impact?

If artifacts containing the `.git` directory are uploaded, an attacker who gains access to the artifacts can:

==== Credential Exposure

Extract the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from `.git/config` despite GitHub's log redaction. The token is stored in plain text in the artifact, allowing unauthorized access to repository resources.

==== Unauthorized Access

With the extracted `GITHUB_TOKEN`, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of the workflow, such as reading sensitive data, modifying code, creating releases, or accessing other repositories the token has permissions for.

==== Supply Chain Compromise

An attacker with the extracted token can modify workflows, inject malicious code, or publish malicious packages, potentially compromising the entire supply chain.

== How to fix it

There are two primary ways to fix this vulnerability. The best method is to prevent the secret from being written, but you can also prevent the secret from being uploaded.

* **Disable Credential Persistence**:
This is the most secure solution. It prevents `actions/checkout` from ever writing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the `.git/config` file.
Set `persist-credentials: false` in your `actions/checkout` step.

* **Exclude the .git Directory**:
If you must use `persist-credentials: true` (for example, to run `git push` in a later step), you can fix this by explicitly excluding the sensitive `.git` directory from the `actions/artifact-upload`.
Add `!.git/` to the path input in your `actions/upload-artifact` step.

==== Compliant solution
If you are using upload-artifact version < 4.4, please upgrade it to minimum v4.4.

[source,yaml,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]

----

jobs:
  test-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: true
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 # >= v4.4 # Compliant
        with:
          name: repo-artifact
          path: .
----

If you want to use `persist-credentials: true` for `actions/checkout@v4`, do not use `include-hidden-files:true` so that `.git` directory is not uploaded:

[source,yaml,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]

----

jobs:
  test-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: true
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: repo-artifact
          path: . 
          # Removed include-hidden-files:true # Compliant
----

If you want to use `persist-credentials: true` and `include-hidden-files:true` for `actions/upload-artifact`, you can exclude the `.git` directory from `upload-artifact` so that `.git` directory is not uploaded:
[source,yaml,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]

jobs:
  test-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: true
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 # >= 4.4
        with:
          name: repo-artifact
          path: |
            .
            !.git/  # Compliant
          include-hidden-files: true

=== How does this work?

By default, `actions/checkout` persists the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `.git/config` as `http.https://github.com/.extraheader` to enable Git operations.

When artifacts are uploaded that include the `.git` directory (either explicitly or through patterns like `.` or `**/*`), the persisted credentials are included in the artifact. An attacker who gains access to the artifact can extract the token from `.git/config` and use it to perform unauthorized actions.

For `upload-artifact` version >= 4.4, when using `include-hidden-files: true`, explicitly excluding `.git/` from the artifact path provides defense-in-depth protection.
