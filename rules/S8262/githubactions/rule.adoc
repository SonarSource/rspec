== Why is this an issue?

By default, `actions/checkout` persists the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `.git/config` as `http.https://github.com/.extraheader`. When artifacts are uploaded that include the `.git` directory, these persisted credentials can be exposed, even though GitHub's log redaction masks tokens in workflow logs.

The vulnerability occurs in two scenarios:

* **Checkout version < 4.4**: When `persist-credentials` is `true` or not set (defaults to `true`), credentials are persisted to `.git/config`. If artifacts are uploaded, the `.git` directory may be included, exposing the token.

* **Checkout version >= 4.4**: When `persist-credentials` is `true` or not set (defaults to `true`), and `include-hidden-files: true` is used in artifact uploads without explicitly excluding `.git/`, the persisted credentials in `.git/config` can be included in artifacts.

=== What is the potential impact?

If artifacts containing the `.git` directory are uploaded, an attacker who gains access to the artifacts can:

==== Credential Exposure

Extract the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from `.git/config` despite GitHub's log redaction. The token is stored in plain text in the artifact, allowing unauthorized access to repository resources.

==== Unauthorized Access

With the extracted `GITHUB_TOKEN`, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of the workflow, such as reading sensitive data, modifying code, creating releases, or accessing other repositories the token has permissions for.

==== Supply Chain Compromise

An attacker with the extracted token can modify workflows, inject malicious code, or publish malicious packages, potentially compromising the entire supply chain.

== How to fix it

Set `persist-credentials: false` in the `actions/checkout` step to prevent credentials from being persisted to `.git/config`:

----

- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    persist-credentials: false

----

Alternatively, if you want to use `persist-credentials: true` and `include-hidden-files:true` for Checkout, you can exclude the `.git` directory from artifact uploads:

----

- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repo-artifact
    path: |
      .
      !.git/
    include-hidden-files: true

=== How does this work?

By default, `actions/checkout` persists the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `.git/config` as `http.https://github.com/.extraheader` to enable Git operations. This allows any subsequent step in the workflow to read the token, even though GitHub's log redaction masks it in workflow logs.

When artifacts are uploaded that include the `.git` directory (either explicitly or through patterns like `.` or `**/*`), the persisted credentials are included in the artifact. An attacker who gains access to the artifact can extract the token from `.git/config` and use it to perform unauthorized actions.

Setting `persist-credentials: false` prevents the token from being stored in `.git/config`, eliminating the risk even if artifacts include the `.git` directory. For checkout version >= 4.4, when using `include-hidden-files: true`, explicitly excluding `.git/` from the artifact path provides defense-in-depth protection.
