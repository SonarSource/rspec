== How to fix it

First, the boolean expression in question should be closely inspected for
logical errors.
If a mistake was made, it can be corrected so that the condition is no longer
gratuitous.

If it becomes apparent that the condition is actually unnecessary,
it can be removed together with the associated control flow construct
(e.g. the `if`-statement containing the condition).
