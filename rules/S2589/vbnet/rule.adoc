== Why is this an issue?

An operand of a boolean expression that never changes the result of the expression might not match the programmer's intent and can lead to unexpected behavior and potential bugs.

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim a = True

If a Then
    DoSomething()
End If
----

This also applies to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/null-conditional-operators[null conditional operator] when one of the operands always evaluates to `Nothing`.

[source,vbnet]
----
  Dim d As String = Nothing
  Dim v1 = If(d, "value")
----

=== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:

* When the condition is a single `Const bool`

[source,vbnet]
----
Const debug = False
'...
If debug Then
    ' Print something
End If
----
* When the condition is the literal `True` or `False`.

In these cases, it is obvious the code is as intended.

== How to fix it

The conditions should be reviewed to decide whether:

* to update the unnecessary operand
* to remove the unnecessary operand

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Sub Sample(ByVal b As Boolean, ByVal c As Boolean)
    Dim a = True
    If a Then                  ' Noncompliant: "a" is always "true"
        DoSomething()
    End If

    If b AndAlso a Then        ' Noncompliant: "a" is always "true"
        DoSomething()
    End If

    If c OrElse Not a Then     ' Noncompliant: "Not a" is always "false"
        DoSomething()
    End If

    Dim d As String = Nothing
    Dim v1 = If(d, "value")    ' Noncompliant: "d" is always Nothing and v1 is always "value".
    Dim v2 = If(s, d)          ' Noncompliant: "d" is always Nothing and v2 is always equal to s.
End Sub
----

==== Compliant solution


[source,vbnet,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Sub Sample(ByVal b As Boolean, ByVal c As Boolean, ByVal s As String)
    Dim a = IsAllowed()
    If a Then                  ' Compliant
        DoSomething()
    End If

    If b AndAlso a Then        ' Compliant
        DoSomething()
    End If

    If c OrElse Not a Then      ' Compliant
        DoSomething()
    End If

    Dim d As String = GetStringData()
    Dim v1 = If(d, "value")  ' Compliant
    Dim v2 = If(s, d)        ' Compliant
End Sub
