Question : should we consider this RSPEC as being fully a subset of RSPEC-2583 ? I think the only motivation behind this split was to use a different severity and this remains a relevant point.

\[~freddy.mallet] I don't really see why this RSPEC is "fully a subset of RSPEC-2583". Maybe that makes sense if it is implemented through symbolic execution with short-circuit logical operators, but then it all depends on the order of sub-conditions. Please consider ``++IF X > 1 AND X = 5++``: I think that this code would raise an issue for the current description of this RSPEC, but not for RSPEC-2583.
