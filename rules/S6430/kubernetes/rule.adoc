Allowing process privilege escalations exposes the Pod to attacks that exploit
setuid binaries.

This field directly controls whether the `no_new_privs` flag is set in the
container process. +
When this flag is enabled, binaries configured with setuid or setgid bits
cannot change their runtime uid or gid: Potential attackers must rely on other
privilege escalation techniques to successfully operate as root on the Pod.

Depending on how resilient the Kubernetes cluster and Pods are, attackers can
extend their attack to the cluster by compromising the nodes from which the
cluster started the Pod.

The `allowPrivilegeEscalation` field should not be set to true unless the Pod's
risks related to setuid or setgid bits have been mitigated.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* This Pod is accessible to people who are not administrators of the Kubernetes cluster.
* This Pod contains binaries with setuid or setgid capabilities.

There is a risk if you answered yes to all of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Disable privilege escalation.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: true # Sensitive

== Compliant Solution
