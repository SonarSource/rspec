This rule raises an issue when you use ECMAScript syntax features that are not supported by your configured Node.js version.

== Why is this an issue?

Using unsupported ECMAScript syntax can cause your application to fail at runtime with syntax errors. Different Node.js versions support different ECMAScript features, and using newer syntax in older Node.js environments will prevent your code from running.

This rule helps ensure compatibility by checking your code against the Node.js version specified in your `package.json` engines field or rule configuration. It prevents deployment issues and ensures your application works correctly in the target environment.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using unsupported syntax features will cause immediate syntax errors when the code is executed, preventing your application from starting or running correctly. This can lead to production failures and deployment issues.

=== How to fix?


Upgrade your Node.js version to support the syntax feature you want to use.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// Node.js 14 configured, but using optional chaining (requires Node.js 14.0.0+)
const value = obj?.property?.nested; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Upgrade Node.js to 14+ or use traditional property access
const value = obj && obj.property && obj.property.nested;
----
