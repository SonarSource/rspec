Compound triggers were introduced to ease the implementation of multiple triggers which need to work in cooperation.


Typically, a ``++FOR EACH ROW++`` trigger accumulates facts, and an ``++AFTER STATEMENT++`` trigger performs the actual changes.


The compound trigger can hold a state common to all the triggers it defines, thereby removing the need to use package variables. This approach is sometimes the only possible one, as when avoiding a mutating table ``++ORA-04091++`` error, or it can be used to get better performance.


However, there is no point in defining a compound trigger which contains only a single trigger, since there is no state to be shared. In such cases, a simple trigger should be used instead.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER my_trigger  -- Noncompliant; defines a single trigger
FOR INSERT ON my_table
COMPOUND TRIGGER

AFTER EACH ROW IS
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New row inserted!');
END AFTER EACH ROW;

END;
/
----


== Compliant Solution

----
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER my_trigger
  AFTER INSERT
  ON my_table
  FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New row inserted!');
END;
/
