When verifying that code raises an exception, a good practice is to avoid having multiple method calls inside the tested code, to be explicit about what is exactly tested.


When two of the methods can raise the same *checked* exception, not respecting this good practice is a bug, since it is not possible to know what is really tested.


You should make sure that only one method can raise the expected checked exception in the tested code.
