S3 buckets can be in three states related to versioning:

* unversioned (default one)
* enabled
* suspended

When the S3 bucket is unversioned or has versioning suspended it means that a new version of an object overwrites an existing one in the S3 bucket. 

It can lead to unintentional or intentional information loss.
