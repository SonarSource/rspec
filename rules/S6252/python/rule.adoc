S3 buckets can be versioned.
When the S3 bucket is unversioned it means that a new version of an object overwrites an existing one in the S3 bucket.

It can lead to unintentional or intentional information loss.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(
    self,
    "Bucket",
    "my-bucket",
    versioned=False       # Sensitive
)
----
The default value of `versioned` is `False` so the absence of this parameter is also sensitive.

== Compliant Solution

[source,python]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(
    self,
    "Bucket",
    "my-bucket",
    versioned=True       # Compliant
)
----
