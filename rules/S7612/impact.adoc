=== What is the potential impact?

==== Account Compromise
The most direct problem is that an attacker can take over the user's account in your application. If they are able to read the stored password from the device, the attacker can log in as the user. Once inside, they could potentially view private information, send messages while impersonating the user, or access other features of the account.

==== The Danger of Password Reuse
Using the same password for multiple websites and applications is a common behavior. If attackers find a password from one application, they will often try that same password on other, more valuable services, such as email, banking, or social media accounts. This is a technique known as credential stuffing. A security weakness in one application can therefore lead to a much broader compromise of a user's digital life.
