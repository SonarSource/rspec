The public API of a framework, plugin, or library is the way its provider intended it to be used.
API stability and compatibility (within the same major version number) of a library are guaranteed only for its public API.

Internal APIs are mere implementation details and are prone to breaking changes as the implementation of the library changes.
No guarantees are being made about them. Therefore, users should not use internal APIs, even when visible.
