The result of a local Android authentication, using biometric credentials, can be tampered by a third party, ie: an attacker might be able to call the ``++onAuthenticationSucceeded++`` callback and access sensitive app data. To preserve the integrity of the authentication, Android provides a way to tie the biometric authentication to a cryptographic operation that can only be performed by unlocking a key stored in the Android keystore.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The biometric authentication allows access to highly sensitive information.

There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to use a ``++CryptoObject++`` during biometric authentications.
