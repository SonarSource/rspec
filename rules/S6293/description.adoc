Android comes with Android KeyStore, a secure container for storing key materials. It's possible to define certain keys to be unlocked only by authenticated users, with biometric credentials. In this way, even if the application process is compromised, the attacker cannot access keys, the presence of the authorized user is required.

These keys can be used, to encrypt, sign or create a message authentication code (MAC) as proof that the authentication result has not been tampered with, ie: an attacker is not able to directly call the ``++onAuthenticationSucceeded++`` method, used normally as a callback after successful authentications, or the underlying critical operations implemented by this callback.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* Cryptographic keys need to be protected using biometric authentication.
* Sensitive information is required to be accessed by authenticated users, with biometric credentials only.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It's recommended to tie the biometric authentication to a cryptographic operation by using a ``++CryptoObject++`` during authentication.
