=== What is the potential impact?

Having the expected value and the actual value in the wrong order will not alter the outcome of tests, 
(succeed/fail when it should) but the error messages will contain misleading information.

This rule raises an issue when the actual argument to an assertions library method is a hard-coded value and the expected argument is not.
