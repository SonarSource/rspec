The standard assertions library methods such as ``AreEqual`` and ``AreSame`` in *MSTest* and *NUnit*, or ``Equal`` and ``Same`` in *XUnit*, expect the first argument to be the expected value and the second argument to be the actual value. Swap them, and your test will still have the same outcome (succeed/fail when it should) but the error messages will be confusing.

This rule raises an issue when the second argument to an assertions library method is a hard-coded value and the first argument is not.
