== Why is this an issue?

The standard PHPUnit assertion methods such as _``++assertEquals++``_, expect the first argument to be the expected value and the second argument to be the actual value. Swap them, and your test will still have the same outcome (succeed/fail when it should) but the error messages will be confusing.


This rule raises an issue when the second argument to an assertions library method is a hard-coded value and the first argument is not.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
self::assertEquals($runner.getExitCode(), 0, "Unexpected exit code"); // Noncompliant; Failed asserting that 0 matches expected 3. Expected :3 Actual :0.
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
self::assertEquals(0, $runner.getExitCode(), "Unexpected exit code");
----
