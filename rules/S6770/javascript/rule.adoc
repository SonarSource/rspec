== Why is this an issue?

User-defined JSX components should use Pascal case because it is a widely accepted convention in the React community. Using Pascal case for component names helps to distinguish them from HTML elements and built-in React components, which are typically written in lowercase. It also improves code readability and makes it easier to differentiate between components and regular HTML tags.

Additionally, adhering to this convention ensures consistency and makes it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code. It is considered a best practice in React development and is recommended by the official React documentation.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
<MY_COMPONENT />
----

You should rename your component according to Pascal case and all its usages as JSX elements.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
<MyComponent />
