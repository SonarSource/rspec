=== What is the potential impact?

Telegram bot keys are used to authenticate and authorize a bot to interact with
the Telegram Bot API. These keys are essentially access tokens that allow the
bot to send and receive messages, manage groups and channels, and perform other
actions on behalf of the bot.

If a Telegram bot key is accidentally exposed to an unintended audience, the
primary concern is that unauthorized individuals may gain access to the bot's
functionalities and data. This could result in misuse or abuse of the bot's
capabilities. For instance, unauthorized users could send unsolicited
messages, spam users, or engage in other disruptive activities using the bot.
