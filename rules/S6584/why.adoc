== Why is this an issue?

Suppose a package manager invocation is part of a script that is executed automatically, and non-interactive mode is not enabled.
Then, execution is aborted because there is no confirming manual input.
As a result, instructions, such as installation or update of packages, cannot be performed in an automated way.
This applies, among others, to the package manager used in Debian-based systems, Advanced Package Tool (APT).
This also apply to `gdebi` package manager, which is used to install packages from a file.
