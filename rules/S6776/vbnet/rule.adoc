Exception stack traces contain sensitive data that the application's code should
not disclose as error messages. 

== Why is this an issue?

Stack traces contain sensitive data like filenames or folder hierarchies. 
They can expose implementation details, including the application's
architecture, logic, and potential vulnerabilities. Attackers can leverage these
valuable insights to identify weaknesses, devise attack strategies, and exploit
vulnerabilities.
