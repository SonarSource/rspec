== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

With the default value for the ``++legalTrailingCommentPattern++`` parameter: ``++^'\s*[^\s]+$++``


[source,vb6]
----
a = b + c   ' This is a trailing comment that could be very very long  -- Noncompliant
d = a + 9 REM This is another trailing comment which could be very very long  -- Noncompliant
e = a * b ' FIXME  -- allowed
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vb6]
----
' This very long comment is better placed before the line of code
a = b + c
REM This is very long comment which is better placed before the line of code
d = a + 9
e = a * b ' FIXME
