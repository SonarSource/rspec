== Why is this an issue?

Spring ``++@Component++``, ``++@Controller++``, ``++@RestController++``,``++@Service++``, and ``++@Repository++`` classes are singletons by default, meaning only one instance of the class is ever instantiated in the application. Typically such a class might have a few ``++static++`` members, such as a logger, but all non-``++static++`` members should be managed by Spring.

This rule raises an issue when a singleton ``++@Component++``, ``++@Controller++``, ``++@RestController++``, ``++@Service++``, or ``++@Repository++``, not annotated with ``++@ConfigurationProperties++``, has non-``++static++`` members that are not annotated with one of:

* ``++org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired++``
* ``++org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value++``
* ``++javax.annotation.Inject++``
* ``++javax.annotation.Resource++``

== How to fix it

Add one of these annotations to all non-``++static++`` members: ``++@Resource++``, ``++@Inject++``, ``++@Autowired++`` or ``++@Value++``.

This is about a https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sonarqube/T-f83S9mvQU[question] on the Google group.


+1 for adding @Resource in this rule. Although annotation @Autowired is well-known among Java developers, it is Spring specific. The newer but standard @Resource annotation is mostly equivalent to @Autowire and should be added to the rule.


I don't know about @Inject - maybe a Guice-specific annotation.


Suggestions:

* Change the rule title into "Members of Spring components should be explicitly injected".
* Give more emphasis to @Resource than to @Autowired, which is slightly outdated. For example, replace
"That is, they should have the @Autowired annotation"

with

"That is, they should have the @Resource (or @Autowired) annotation"

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] despite the fact that Jira can't properly render its own code markdown when immediately followed by non-space characters, RuleAPI handles this correctly. 


The current version is awkward IMO and should either get the 's'es back, or the word "classes" before "are singletons by default".

\[~ann.campbell.2] Thanks for the info. I'll add "classes" then so that it works in both Jira and RuleAPI.
