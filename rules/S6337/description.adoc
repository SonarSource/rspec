IBM API keys are used to authenticate applications that consume IBM Cloud APIs.

If your application interacts with IBM then it requires credentials to access all the resources it needs to function properly. Resources that can be accessed depend on the permissions granted to the account. These credentials may authenticate a user who has unrestricted access to all resources in your account, including billing information.
