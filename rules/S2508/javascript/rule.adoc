== Why is this an issue?

When using the Backbone.js framework, the names of model attributes should not contain spaces. This is because the Events object accepts space-delimited lists of events, so an attributes with spaces in the names could be misinterpreted.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
        defaults: {
            'first name': 'Bob',      // Noncompliant
            'birth date': new Date()  // Noncompliant
        },
    });
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
        defaults: {
            firstName: 'Bob',
            birthDate: new Date()
        },
    });
----
