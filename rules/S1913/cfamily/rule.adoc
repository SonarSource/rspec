== Why is this an issue?

Given an expression `e` of type `T`, `sizeof(e)` returns the size in bytes of `T`.
The `sizeof` operator results in a value of `size_t`.
Also, `sizeof(e)` has no side effects because `e` is not evaluated.
Therefore, `sizeof(sizeof(e))` is equivalent to `sizeof(size_t)`.

In other words, `sizeof(sizeof(e))` always gives the same result and does not depend on `e`, which is unlikely what was expected.

== How to fix it

This defect is usually the consequence of a typo, and the fix is to remove one level of `sizeof`.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void function() {
  char buffer[42];
  char buffer2[sizeof(sizeof(buffer))]; // Noncompliant: a single sizeof() was intended

  memcpy(buffer, "Hello, world!", strlen("Hello, world!")+1);
  memcpy(buffer2, buffer, sizeof(buffer)); // Buffer overflow
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void function() {
  char buffer[42];
  char buffer2[sizeof(buffer)]; // Compliant

  memcpy(buffer, "Hello, world!", strlen("Hello, world!")+1);
  memcpy(buffer2, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
}
