Overly complicated regular expressions are hard to read and to maintain and can easily cause hard-to-find bugs. If a regex is too complicated, you should consider replacing it or parts of it with regular code or splitting it apart into multiple patterns at least.


The complexity of a regular expression is determined as follows:


Each of the following operators increases the complexity by an amount equal to the current nesting level and also increases the current nesting level by one for its arguments:


* ``++|++`` - when multiple ``++|++`` operators are used together, the subsequent ones only increase the complexity by 1
* ``++&&++`` (inside character classes) - when multiple ``++&&++`` operators are used together, the subsequent ones only increase the complexity by 1
* Quantifiers (``++*++``, ``+``, ``++?++``, ``++{n,m}++``, ``++{n,}++`` or ``++{n}++``)
* Non-capturing groups that set flags (such as ``++(?i:some_pattern)++`` or ``++(?i)some_pattern++``)
* Lookahead and lookbehind assertions

Additionally, each use of the following features increase the complexity by 1 regardless of nesting:


* character classes
* back references

If a regular expression is split among multiple variables, the complexity is calculated for each variable individually, not for the whole regular expression. If a regular expression is split over multiple lines, each line is treated individually if it is accompanied by a comment (either a Java comment or a comment within the regular expression), otherwise the regular expression is analyzed as a whole.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (dateString.matches("^(?:(?:31(\\/|-|\\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\\/|-|\\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\\d)?\\d{2})$|^(?:29(\\/|-|\\.)0?2\\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\\d|2[0-8])(\\/|-|\\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\\d)?\\d{2})$")) {
    handleDate(dateString);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
    if (dateString.matches("^\\d{1,2}([-/.])\\d{1,2}\\1\\d{1,4}$")) {
        String dateParts[] = dateString.split("[-/.]");
        int day = Integer.parseInt(dateParts[0]);
        int month = Integer.parseInt(dateParts[1]);
        int year = Integer.parseInt(dateParts[2]);
        // Put logic to validate and process the date based on its integer parts here
    }
----


== Exceptions

Regular expressions are only analyzed if all parts of the regular expression are either string literals, effectively final local variables or ``++static final++`` fields, all of which can be combined using the \'``+``' operator.


When a regular expression is split among multiple variables or commented lines, each part is only analyzed if it is syntactically valid by itself.
