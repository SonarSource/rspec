=== Exceptions

Regular expressions are only analyzed if all parts of the regular expression are either string literals, effectively final local variables or ``++static final++`` fields, all of which can be combined using the \'``+``' operator.


When a regular expression is split among multiple variables or commented lines, each part is only analyzed if it is syntactically valid by itself.
