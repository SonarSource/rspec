``errno`` is a facility of C++ which should in theory be useful, but which in practice is poorly defined by ISO/IEC 14882:2003. A non-zero value may or may not indicate that a problem has occurred; therefore ``errno`` shall not be used.

Even for those functions for which the behaviour of ``errno`` is well defined, it is preferable to check the values of inputs before calling the function rather than relying on using ``errno`` to trap errors.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cerrno>

void f1 (const char * str)
{
  errno = 0; // Noncompliant
  int i = atoi(str);
  if ( 0 != errno ) // Noncompliant
  {
    // handle error case???
  }
}
