== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Only administrators should have access to the service account key used by your application.

As a consequence, service account keys should not be stored along with the application code as they would grant special privileges to anyone who has access to the application source code.

Keys should be stored outside of the code in a file that is never committed to your application code repository.

If possible, a better alternative is to use your cloud provider's service for managing secrets. On Google Cloud this service is called https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager[Secret Manager].

When keys are disclosed in the application code, consider them as compromised and revoke them immediately.
