==== Noncompliant code example

Here is an example of a service account key file. In general it is in the form
of a json file as demonstrated in the
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating[GCP docs].

[source,json]

    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "example-project",
    "private_key_id": "2772b8e6f42dc67369b98f0b91694f7805b28844",

}

==== Compliant solution

Always avoid committing service account key files to public systems. Use any
`*ignore` file possible, such as `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore` and equivalents
for any other system accessing your local codebase.
