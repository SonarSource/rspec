=== What is the potential impact?

A well-intentioned user opens a malicious link that injects a session cookie in
their web browser. This forces the user into unknowingly browsing a session
that isn't theirs.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Sensitive data disclosure

A victim introduces sensitive data within the attacker's application session
that can later be retrieved by them. This can lead to a variety of implications
depending on what type of data is disclosed. Strictly confidential user data or
organizational data leakage have different impacts.

==== Vulnerability chaining

An attacker not only manipulates a user into browsing an application using a
session cookie of their control but also successfully detects and exploits a
self-XSS on the target application. +
The victim browses the vulnerable page using the attacker's session and is
affected by the XSS, which can then be used for a wide range of attacks
including credential stealing using mirrored login pages.
