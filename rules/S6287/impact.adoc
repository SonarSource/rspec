=== What is the potential impact?

Session Cookie Injection makes it possible for an attacker to force a victim
into browsing within an application session to which they also have access.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various effects of
an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Sensitive data disclosure

An attacker manipulates a user into browsing an application using a session
cookie of his control. The victim introduces sensitive data that the attacker can later retrieve within his browser session.

==== Vulnerability chaining

An attacker manipulates a user into browsing an application using a session
cookie of their control and successfully detects and exploits a self-XSS
on the target application. The victim browses the affected page using the attacker's
session and is affected by the XSS.
