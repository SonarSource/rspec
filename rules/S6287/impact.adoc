=== What is the potential impact?

A well-intentioned user opens a malicious link that injects a session cookie in their web
browser. This forces the user into unknowingly browsing a session
that isn't theirs.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various effects of
an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Sensitive data disclosure

A victim introduces sensitive data within the attacker's application session that
can later be retrieved by them. This can lead to a variety of implications depending
on what type of data is disclosed.

==== Vulnerability chaining

An attacker not only manipulates a user into browsing an application using a session
cookie of their control but also successfully detects and exploits a self-XSS
on the target application. +
The victim browses the vulnerable page using the attacker's session and is
affected by the XSS, which can then be used for a wide range of attacks
including credential stealing using mirrored login pages.
