=== How does this work?

Untrusted data, such as GET or POST request content, should always be considered tainted. Therefore, an application should not blindly assign the value of a session cookie to untrusted data.

Session cookies should be generated using the built-in APIs of secure libraries
that include session management instead of developing homemade tools. +
Often, these existing solutions benefit from quality maintenance in terms of
features, security, or hardening, and it is usually better to use these
solutions than to develop your own.
