=== How does this work?

Untrusted data, such as GET or POST request content, should always be
considered tainted. An application should not blindly assign session cookies' values
based on taintable data.

Session cookies should be generated using the built-in APIs of secure libraries
that include session management instead of developing homemade tools. +
Often, these existing solutions benefit from quality maintenance in terms of
features, security, or hardening, and it is usually better to use these
solutions than to develop your own.
