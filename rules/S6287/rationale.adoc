Session Cookie Injections occur when a web application assigns session cookies
to users using untrusted data.

Session cookies are used by web applications to identify users; thus,
controlling these enable control over the identity of the users within the
application.

The injection might occur via a GET parameter, and the payload, for example,
`https://example.com?cookie=injectedcookie`, delivered using phishing
techniques.
