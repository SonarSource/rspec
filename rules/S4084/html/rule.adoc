In order to make your site usable by as many people as possible, subtitles should be provided for videos.


This rule raises an issue when a ``++video++`` does not include at least one ``++<track/>++`` tag with the ``++kind++`` attribute set to ``++captions++``, or ``++descriptions++`` or at the very least ``++subtitles++``.

Note that the ``++subtitles++`` kind is not meant for accessibility but for translation. The kind ``++captions++`` targets people with hearing impairment, whereas ``++descriptions++`` targets people with vision impairment.
