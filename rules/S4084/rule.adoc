In order to make your site usable by as many people as possible, subtitles should be provided for videos.

This rule raises an issue when a ``video`` does not include at least one ``<track/>`` tag with the ``kind`` attribute set to ``captions``, or ``descriptions`` or at the very least ``subtitles``.
Note that the ``subtitles`` kind is not meant for accessibility but for translation. The kind ``captions`` targets people with hearing impairment, whereas ``descriptions`` targets people with vision impairment.
