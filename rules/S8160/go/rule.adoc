This is an issue when you have multiple consecutive if-else-if statements that check different conditions and could be replaced with a cleaner switch statement without a condition.

== Why is this an issue?

Long chains of if-else-if statements can become difficult to read and maintain, especially as they grow longer. Go provides a clean alternative through switch statements without conditions (equivalent to `switch true`).

When you write multiple if-else-if statements, each condition is evaluated sequentially, and the code can become visually cluttered with repeated `if` and `else` keywords. This pattern is particularly problematic when:

* The chain contains three or more conditions
* Each condition is independent and checks different criteria
* The logic flow is essentially the same as a switch statement

Go's switch without condition offers several advantages:

* **Cleaner syntax**: Each case is clearly separated and easier to scan
* **Better readability**: The intent is more obvious - you're selecting one path from multiple options
* **Consistent formatting**: Cases align naturally, making the code structure more apparent
* **Easier maintenance**: Adding, removing, or modifying conditions is simpler

The `switch` statement without a condition is equivalent to `switch true`, where each case contains a boolean expression. This is an idiomatic Go pattern that many developers find more readable than long if-else chains.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue affects code maintainability and readability. While it doesn't introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities, it makes the code harder to understand and modify. Teams working with the code may spend more time parsing complex if-else chains, and future changes become more error-prone.

== How to fix it

Replace the if-else-if chain with a switch statement without a condition. Move each condition into a case clause, and convert the final else into a default case.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
func categorizeNumber(x int) string {
    if x < 0 {
        return "negative"
    } else if x == 0 { // Noncompliant
        return "zero"
    } else if x < 10 {
        return "small positive"
    } else {
        return "large positive"
    }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
func categorizeNumber(x int) string {
    switch {
    case x < 0:
        return "negative"
    case x == 0:
        return "zero"
    case x < 10:
        return "small positive"
    default:
        return "large positive"
    }
}
