== Why is this an issue?

Before {cpp}11, the only way to refer to a null pointer was by using the integer literal ``++0++``, which created ambiguity about whether a pointer or an integer was intended. Even with the ``++NULL++`` macro, the underlying value is still ``++0++``. 


{cpp}11 introduced the keyword ``++nullptr++``, which unambiguously refers to the null pointer. It should be used systematically.

void f(char *c);
void g(int);
void usage()
{
    f(0); // Noncompliant
    f(NULL); // Noncompliant
    f(nullptr); // Compliant: unambiguous

    g(0); // Compliant, a real integer
    // g(nullptr); // This would not compile
}
