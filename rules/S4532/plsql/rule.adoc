== Why is this an issue?

Labels are useful to match the begin and end of each PACKAGE, PROCEDURE or FUNCTION, especially when the code is badly indented or too much nested. 

This rule raised an issue when the END statement of a PACKAGE, PROCEDURE or FUNCTION is having no label matching the name of the corresponding "begin" statement.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY cust_sal AS  

   PROCEDURE find_sal(c_id customers.id%TYPE) IS 
   c_sal customers.salary%TYPE; 
   BEGIN 
      SELECT salary INTO c_sal 
      FROM customers 
      WHERE id = c_id; 
      dbms_output.put_line('Salary: '|| c_sal); 
   END; -- Noncompliant; not a PROCEDURE
END; -- Noncompliant; not a PACKAGE
/
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY cust_sal AS  

   PROCEDURE find_sal(c_id customers.id%TYPE) IS 
   c_sal customers.salary%TYPE; 
   BEGIN 
      SELECT salary INTO c_sal 
      FROM customers 
      WHERE id = c_id; 
      dbms_output.put_line('Salary: '|| c_sal); 
   END find_sal; -- Compliant; it's matching the name of the PROCEDURE
END cust_sal; -- Compliant: it's matching the name of the PACKAGE
