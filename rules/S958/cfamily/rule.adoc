== Why is this an issue?

While it is legal to place ``++#define++`` and ``++#undef++`` directives anywhere in a source file, placing them outside of the global namespace is misleading since their scope is not actually restricted. This may be inconsistent with developer expectations.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
namespace NS
{
  #ifndef MY_HDR
  #define MY_HDR    /* Noncompliant */
  #undef FOO        /* Noncompliant */
  #endif
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
#ifndef MY_HDR
#define MY_HDR
#undef FOO
#endif
----
