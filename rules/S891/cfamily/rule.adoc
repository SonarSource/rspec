== Why is this an issue?

loop-control-variables are either the loop-counter, or flags used for early loop termination. The code is easier to understand if these are not modified within condition or expression.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
for ( x = 0; ( x < 10 ) && !bool_a; ++x )
{
  if ( ... )
  {
    bool_a = true; // Compliant
  }
}

bool test_a ( bool * pB )
{
 *pB = ... ? true : false;
 return *pB;
}

for ( x = 0;  ( x < 10 ) && test_a ( &bool_a ); ++x ) // Noncompliant, 'bool_a' modified in the condition
volatile bool status;
for ( x = 0; ( x < 10 ) && status; ++x) // Compliant
for ( x = 0; x < 10; bool_a = test( ++x ) ) // Noncompliant, bool_a modified in the expression.
----


=== Exceptions

Note that it is possible for a loop-control-variable with volatile qualification to change value (or have it changed) outside statement due to the volatile nature of the object. Such modification does not break this rule.
