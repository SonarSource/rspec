This is an issue when function or method names start with 'Get' or 'get' prefix, unless the underlying concept specifically uses the word 'get' (like HTTP GET operations).

== Why is this an issue?

In Go, using 'Get' prefixes in function and method names is considered redundant and goes against established naming conventions. The Go community follows the principle that functions returning something should be given noun-like names, starting directly with the noun rather than prefixing it with 'Get'.

This convention exists because the function signature already makes it clear that something is being returned. Adding 'Get' creates unnecessary verbosity without adding meaningful information. For example, ``++func (c *Config) GetJobName()++`` is less idiomatic than ``++func (c *Config) JobName()++``.

The 'Get' prefix pattern comes from other programming languages like Java, where getters and setters are common. However, Go's philosophy emphasizes simplicity and conciseness, making such prefixes unnecessary.

Following this convention makes code more readable and consistent with the broader Go ecosystem, including the standard library and most open-source Go projects.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using 'Get' prefixes in function names reduces code readability and makes the codebase inconsistent with Go naming conventions. While this doesn't cause functional issues, it can:

* Make the code appear less idiomatic to Go developers
* Reduce maintainability as the naming doesn't follow community standards
* Create inconsistency when working with standard library and third-party packages that follow Go conventions
* Make function names unnecessarily verbose

== How to fix it

Remove the 'Get' or 'get' prefix from function and method names, keeping the noun part of the name. The function signature already indicates that a value is being returned.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
func (c *Config) GetJobName(key string) (value string, ok bool) {
    // implementation
    return c.jobs[key], true
}

func GetCounts() int { // Noncompliant
    return len(items)
}

func getUserData() string { // Noncompliant
    return userData
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
func (c *Config) JobName(key string) (value string, ok bool) {
    // implementation
    return c.jobs[key], true
}

func Counts() int {
    return len(items)
}

func userData() string {
    return userData
}
----
