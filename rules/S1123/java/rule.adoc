== Why is this an issue?

Deprecation should be marked with both the ``++@Deprecated++`` annotation and @deprecated Javadoc tag. The annotation enables tools such as IDEs to warn about referencing deprecated elements, and the tag can be used to explain when it was deprecated, why, and how references should be refactored.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
class MyClass {

  @Deprecated
  public void foo1() {    // Noncompliant: Add the missing @deprecated Javadoc tag.
  }

  /**
    * @deprecated
    */
  public void foo2() {    // Noncompliant: Add the missing @Deprecated annotation.
  }

}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
class MyClass {

  /**
    * @deprecated (when, why, refactoring advice...)
    */
  @Deprecated
  public void foo1() {
  }

}
----


=== Exceptions

The members and methods of a deprecated class or interface are ignored by this rule. The classes and interfaces themselves are still subject to it.


[source,java]
----
/**
 * @deprecated (when, why, etc...)
 */
@Deprecated
class Qix  {

  public void foo() {} // Compliant; class is deprecated

}

/**
 * @deprecated (when, why, etc...)
 */
@Deprecated
interface Plop {

  void bar();
