== Why is this an issue?

Naming the members of an inner class the same as the static members of its enclosing class is possible but generally considered a bad practice. That's because maintainers may be confused about which members are being used in a given context. Instead the inner class member should be given distinct and descriptive name, and all references to it should be updated accordingly.

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class Outer
{
  public static int A;

  public class Inner
  {
    public int A; // Noncompliant

    public int MyProp
    {
      get => A; // Returns inner A. Was that intended?
    }
  }
}
----

Here's an example of compliant code after renaming the inner class member:

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class Outer
{
  public static int A;

  public class Inner
  {
    public int B; // Compliant

    public int MyProp
    {
      get => A; // Returns outer A
    }
  }
}
