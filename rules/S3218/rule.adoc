It's possible to name the members of an inner class the same as the ``++static++`` members of its enclosing class - possible, but a bad idea. That's because maintainers may be confused about which members are being used where. Instead the inner class' members should be renamed and all the references updated.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class Outer
{
  public static int A;

  public class Inner
  {
    public int A; //Noncompliant
    public int MyProp
    {
      get { return A; }  // Returns inner A. Was that intended?
    }
  }
}
----
After a rename

----
class Outer
{
  public static int A;

  public class Inner
  {
    public int B;
    public int MyProp
    {
      get { return A; }  // Still compiles and runs but functionality has changed
    }
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
class Outer
{
  public static int A;

  public class Inner
  {
    public int InnerA;
    public int MyProp
    {
      get { return InnerA; }
    }
  }
}
