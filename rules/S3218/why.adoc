== Why is this an issue?

Naming the members of an inner class the same as the static members of its enclosing class is possible but generally considered a bad practice. That's because maintainers may be confused about which members are being used in a given context. Instead the inner class member should be given distinct and descriptive name, and all references to it should be updated accordingly.
