== Why is this an issue?

There is no good reason to declare a field "public" and "static" without also declaring it "const". Most of the time this is a kludge to share a state among several objects. But with this approach, any object can do whatever it wants with the shared state, such as setting it to ``++null++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,flex]
----
public class Greeter {
  public static var foo:Foo = new Foo(...);
  ...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,flex]
----
public class Greeter {
  public static const FOO:Foo = new Foo(...);
  ...
}
----
