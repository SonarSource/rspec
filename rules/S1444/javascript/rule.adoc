== Why is this an issue?

Public ``++static++`` fields in TypeScript should be declared as ``++readonly++`` to prevent them from being modified after their initial assignment. This is a good practice because it makes the code safer by preventing accidental changes to these fields, which could lead to bugs that are hard to detect.

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class MyClass {
    static myField = 42; // Noncompliant
}
----

To fix this, declare your static field with the ``++readonly++`` qualifier.

[source,typescript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class MyClass {
    static readonly myField = 42;
}
