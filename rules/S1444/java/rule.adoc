== Why is this an issue?

There is no good reason to declare a field "public" and "static" without also declaring it "final". Most of the time this is a kludge to share a state among several objects. But with this approach, any object can do whatever it wants with the shared state, such as setting it to ``++null++``. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class Greeter {
  public static Foo foo = new Foo();
  ...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public class Greeter {
  public static final Foo FOO = new Foo();
  ...
}
----
