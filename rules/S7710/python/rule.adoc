This rule raises an issue when `torch.tensor()` is called with nested list comprehensions that create empty lists, which can be replaced with `torch.empty()`.

== Why is this an issue?

Using nested list comprehensions to create empty tensors with specific dimensions is unnecessarily complex and harder to understand than PyTorch's built-in alternatives.

When you write `torch.tensor([[[] for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(5)])`, you're creating a complex nested structure just to get an empty tensor with shape `(5, 3, 0)`. This approach has several drawbacks:

* **Readability**: The nested list comprehension syntax is verbose and requires mental parsing to understand the intended dimensions
* **Maintainability**: Changing dimensions requires modifying the list comprehension logic rather than simple numeric parameters
* **Performance**: Creating intermediate list structures before converting to tensors is less efficient than direct tensor allocation
* **Intent clarity**: The code doesn't clearly express that you want an empty tensor with specific dimensions

PyTorch provides `torch.empty()` specifically for creating uninitialized tensors with given dimensions. This function is designed for exactly this use case and makes your code more idiomatic.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using complex list comprehensions instead of `torch.empty()` makes code harder to read and maintain. It can also impact performance due to unnecessary intermediate list creation, especially when working with large tensor dimensions.

=== How to fix in PyTorch?

Replace the nested list comprehension with `torch.empty()`, specifying the dimensions directly as arguments. The last dimension should be 0 to create an empty tensor.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import torch

# Complex list comprehension for empty tensor
empty_tensor = torch.tensor([[[] for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(5)])  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import torch

# Direct empty tensor creation
empty_tensor = torch.empty(5, 3, 0)
----

For dynamic dimensions, pass variables directly to `torch.empty()` instead of using them in list comprehensions.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import torch

a, b = 10, 5
results = torch.tensor([[[] for _ in range(b)] for _ in range(a)])  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
import torch

a, b = 10, 5
results = torch.empty(a, b, 0)
