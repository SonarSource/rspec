== Why is this an issue?

Non-private `static` fields that are neither `const` nor `readonly` can lead to errors and unpredictable behavior.

This can happen because:
* Any object can modify these fields and alter the global state. This makes the code more difficult to read, debug and test.
* Correctly accessing these fields from different threads needs synchronization with `lock`. Improper synchronization may lead to unexpected results.

Publicly visible static fields should only be used to store shared data that does not change.
To enforce this intent, these fields should be marked `readonly` or converted to `const`.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class Math
{
  public static double Pi = 3.14;  // Noncompliant
}
----
or

[source,csharp]
----
public class Shape
{
  public static Shape Empty = new EmptyShape();  // Noncompliant

  private class EmptyShape : Shape
  {
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public class Math
{
  public const double Pi = 3.14;
}
----
or

[source,csharp]
----
public class Shape
{
  public static readonly Shape Empty = new EmptyShape();

  private class EmptyShape : Shape
  {
  }
}
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] we should forget the technical difficulty to implement rules. If we really do that, this rule should become"A static field should never be updated from a thread". Because if the rule is really ""public static" fields should be "readonly"" we're going to generate a big amount of false positives

And as soon as we're talking about multi-threading issue, the "multi-threading" tag should be used.

The main idea is the same, ``++public static++`` fields should be either ``++const++`` or ``++readonly++``.
