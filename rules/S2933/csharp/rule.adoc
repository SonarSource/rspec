== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class Person
{
    private int _birthYear;  // Noncompliant

    Person(int birthYear) 
    {
        _birthYear = birthYear;
    }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public class Person
{
    private readonly int _birthYear;

    Person(int birthYear) 
    {
        _birthYear = birthYear;
    }
}
----

=== Exceptions

* Fields with attributes are ignored.
* Fields of type ``++struct++`` that are not primitive or pointer types are also ignored because of possible unwanted behavior.
