ViewBag and ViewData dictionaries enable controllers to pass data to their views as weakly typed collections. Reading the provided values is dynamically resolved at runtime without any compile-time checking. This can lead to unexpected behavior, since reading a missing value does not produce an exception.


Controllers should pass data to their views via a strongly typed view model class.
