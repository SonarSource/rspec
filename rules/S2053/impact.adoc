=== What is the potential impact?

Despite best efforts, even well-guarded systems might have vulnerabilities that
could allow an attacker to gain access to the hashed passwords. This could be
due to software vulnerabilities, insider threats, or even successful phishing
attempts that give attackers the access they need.

Once the attacker has these hashes, they will likely attempt to crack them using
a couple of methods. The first is brute force, which entails trying every
possible combination until the correct password is found. While this can be
time-consuming, having the same salt for all users or a short salt can make the
task significantly easier and faster.

If multiple users have the same password and the same salt, their password
hashes would be identical. This means that if an attacker successfully cracks
one hash, they have effectively cracked all identical ones, granting them access
to multiple accounts at once.

A short salt increases the odds of different users having the same salt.
Combined with a common password, this can lead to multiple identical hashes,
easing the cracking process for an attacker.
