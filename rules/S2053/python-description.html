<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the process of password hashing, an additional component, known as a
"salt," is often integrated to bolster the overall security. This salt, acting
as a defensive measure, primarily wards off certain types of attacks that
leverage pre-computed tables to crack passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, potential risks emerge when the salt is deemed insecure. This can occur
when the salt is consistently the same across all users or when it is too short or predictable.
In scenarios where users share the same password and salt, their password hashes
will inevitably mirror each other. Similarly, a short salt heightens the
probability of multiple users unintentionally having identical salts, which can
potentially lead to identical password hashes. These identical hashes streamline
the process for potential attackers to recover clear-text passwords. Thus, the emphasis on
implementing secure, unique, and sufficiently lengthy salts in password-hashing
functions is vital.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite best efforts, even well-guarded systems might have vulnerabilities that
could allow an attacker to gain access to the hashed passwords. This could be
due to software vulnerabilities, insider threats, or even successful phishing
attempts that give attackers the access they need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the attacker has these hashes, they will likely attempt to crack them using
a couple of methods. One is brute force, which entails trying every
possible combination until the correct password is found. While this can be
time-consuming, having the same salt for all users or a short salt can make the
task significantly easier and faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If multiple users have the same password and the same salt, their password
hashes would be identical. This means that if an attacker successfully cracks
one hash, they have effectively cracked all identical ones, granting them access
to multiple accounts at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A short salt, while less critical than a shared one, still increases the odds of
different users having the same salt. This might create clusters of password
hashes with identical salt that can then be attacked as explained before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With short salts, the probability of a collision between two users' passwords
and salts couple might be low depending on the salt size. The shorter the salt,
the higher the collision probability. In any case, using longer,
cryptographically secure salt should be preferred.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To securely store password hashes, it is a recommended to rely on
key derivation functions that are computationally intensive. Examples of such
functions are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Argon2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PBKDF2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrypt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bcrypt</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When they are used for password storage, using a secure, random salt is
required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, those functions can also be used for other purposes such as master key
derivation or password-based pre-shared key generation. In those cases, the
implemented cryptographic protocol might require using a fixed salt to derive
keys in a deterministic way. In such cases, using a fixed salt is safe and
accepted.</p>
