In cryptography, "salt" is extra piece of data which is included in a hashing algorithm. It makes dictionary attacks more difficult. Using a cryptographic hash function without an unpredictable salt increases the likelihood that an attacker will be able to successfully guess a hashed value such as a password with a dictionary attack.

This rule raises an issue when a hashing function which has been specifically designed for hashing sensitive data, such as PBKDF2, is used with a non-random, reused or too short salt value. It does not raise an issue on base hashing algorithms such as sha1 or md5 as these are often used for other purposes.
