== Why is this an issue?

According to the SAP documentation:

____
System functions are only intended for internal usage. Incompatible changes and further development is possible at any time and without warning or notice.

____

So calling system C functions using a ``++CALL++`` statement should be avoided.


=== Noncompliant code example

CALL 'MULTIPLY' ID 'P1'  FIELD '9999' 
                ID 'P2'  FIELD '9999'
