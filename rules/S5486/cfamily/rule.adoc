`pthread_mutex_t` should not be locked when already locked, or unlocked when already unlocked.

== Why is this an issue?

_Mutexes_ are synchronization primitives that allow to manage concurrency.
This is the most fundamental building block for creating _safe_ concurrent applications.
By using a _mutex_, one can ensure that a block of code is executed by a single thread concurrently.
Data structures are designed to maintain their invariants between member-function calls.
If a data structure is accessed concurrently, and one of the accesses is a write operation, then it has a _data race_.
Having _data races_ is _undefined behavior_.

Adversaries actively exploit _data races_ to take over systems, but _data races_
are also a common source of _data corruption_ in concurrent applications
resulting in dormant and hard-to-find bugs.

To prevent _data races_, the shared resource (usually memory) must be protected
by obtaining mutual access to the data during both reading and writing.
Such mutual exclusion is generally achieved by using a _mutex_, which is
frequently referred to as a _lock_.

A _mutex_ has two states: _released_ - which is the initial state, or _acquired_.
These two states are frequently called _unlocked_ and _locked_ as well.

To effectively protect the shared resource from concurrent accesses, all such accesses should be guarded by the same _mutex_.
They need to _lock_ the _mutex_ to gain _safe_ exclusive access to the resource and _unlock_ it after they are done mutating or reading it.

You can abstract away the concurrent threads sharing the mutex and think of it as owned by the current thread.
It never spontaneously changes between _acquired_ and _released_.

In this view, these are the possible transitions when calling ``lock`` or ``unlock`` on a _mutex_ in a given state:

. _released_ + ``lock()``   => _acquired_
. _acquired_ + ``unlock()`` => _released_
. _acquired_ + ``lock()``   => _deadlock_
. _released_ + ``unlock()`` => _undefined behavior_

When a thread locks a mutex, another thread trying to _acquire_ the same mutex will be _blocked_ and have to wait for the first thread to _release_ it.
This waiting period can take some time.
If a thread attempts to lock a mutex it has already acquired, it will _deadlock_ because it would need to release it to lock it again.

=== What is the potential impact?

Locking an _acquired_ mutex leads to a _deadlock_, as a mutex can only be obtained once.
Unlocking a _released_ mutex is _undefined behavior_.
Removing synchronization can cause _data races_, leading to _data corruption_,
which adversaries might leverage to take over the system.

=== Exceptions

There are _recursive mutexes_ that can be _acquired_ multiple times by the same
thread, given that just as many times we also _release_ the _mutex_.
They are rare in practice and usually signal design problems in the code.
Thus we assume ``++pthread_mutex_t++`` refers to _non-recursive_ mutexes.

== How to fix it

Never lock an _acquired_ mutex.
Lock the mutexes in a strict order that is followed throughout the project.
Unlock operations should be done the same way but in reversed order.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t m1 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t m2 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void locks() {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m1);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m1); // Noncompliant: 'm1' is already acquired
}

void unlocks() {
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m1);
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m1); // Noncompliant: 'm1' is already released
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t m1 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t m2 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void locks() {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m1);
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m2); // Compliant: we acquired both 'm1' and 'm2' for the first time.
}

void unlocks() {
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m2);
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m1); // Compliant: we released both 'm1' and 'm2' for the first time.
}
----

=== Pitfalls

Calling arbitrary functions while holding a lock should be avoided,
as the function might also want to lock the resource we already acquired,
causing a deadlock. One particular example of such functions is callbacks.

[source,c]
----
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void handle_callback(void (*callback)(void)) {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
  callback(); // If tries to lock mutex 'm', then we have a deadlock.
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
----

=== Going the extra mile

The section of code for which the _mutex_ is _acquired_ is called the _critical section_.
Inside the _critical section_, we are the only ones with access to the shared resource.
Thus we are free to mutate or read it without considering what other threads are doing
concurrently. However, having large _critical sections_ can prevent other threads
from making progress if they want to also _acquire_ the same _mutex_ and access
the shared resource.
Consequently, _critical sections_ are supposed to be as small as possible.

[source,c]
----
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int input;
int result;
bool isFib;

// Guards both 'num1' and 'num2'.
pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

int fibonacci(int n);
int factorial(int n);

void locks(bool calcFib, int n) {
  // Do the calculations without taking the lock.
  int res;
  if (calcFib) {
    res = fibonacci(n);
  } else {
    res = factorial(n);
  }

  pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
  // Critical section starts
  input = n;
  result = res;
  isFib = calcFib;
  // Critical section ends.
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
