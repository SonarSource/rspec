Amazon Marketplace Web Service credentials are designed to authenticate and authorize Amazon sellers.

If your application interacts with Amazon MWS then it requires credentials to access all the resources it needs to function properly. The credential authenticates to a seller account which can have access to ressources like products, orders, price or shipment informations.
