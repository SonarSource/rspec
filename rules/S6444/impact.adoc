=== What is the potential impact?

The absence of a timeout in regular expressions can lead to significant security
issues.

==== System Slowdown

When a regular expression without a timeout is given a complex input that takes
a long time to process, it can consume a substantial amount of system resources.
This can slow down the entire system, affecting not only the specific process
involved but also other processes running on the same system.

==== Service Unavailability

In more severe cases, a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack can
cause the system to become unresponsive. If the system spends too much time
trying to process a complex regular expression, it might stop responding to
other requests. This can lead to a denial of service, where legitimate users are
unable to access the system or use the software.
