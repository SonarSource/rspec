Regular expressions are used to identify specific patterns within a string of
text. However, when a timeout for these regular expressions is not specified in
the code, it can lead to a potential security vulnerability.

The crux of this vulnerability lies in the processing of user input. If a user
provides a complex input that matches the regular expression in an intricate
way, the system might get caught in an extensive matching process. Without a
specified timeout, this process could continue indefinitely, consuming system
resources progressively.
