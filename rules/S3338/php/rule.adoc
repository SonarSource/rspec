== Why is this an issue?

``++file_uploads++`` is an on-by-default PHP configuration that allows files to be uploaded to your site. Since accepting [.line-through]#candy# files from strangers is inherently dangerous, this feature should be disabled unless it is absolutely necessary for your site.


This rule raises an issue when ``++file_uploads++`` is not explicitly disabled.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
file_uploads=1  ; Noncompliant

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
file_uploads=0
----
