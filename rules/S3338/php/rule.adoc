== Why is this an issue?

``++file_uploads++`` is an on-by-default PHP configuration that allows files to be uploaded to your site. Since accepting [.line-through]#candy# files from strangers is inherently dangerous, this feature should be disabled unless it is absolutely necessary for your site.


This rule raises an issue when ``++file_uploads++`` is not explicitly disabled.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
file_uploads=1  ; Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
file_uploads=0
----

\[~ann.campbell.2] from the sentence "This rule raises an issue when file_uploads *is not explicitly disabled.*" I understand taht the rule it will not raise any issue if and only if the following line is present in the file: "file_uploads=*0*" is correct ? 

I yes, maybe a compliant code snippet could be aded, WDYT ?
