\[~samuel.mercier] [~massimo.paladin] [~evgeny.mandrikov] this rule says it's okay to define preprocessing identifiers either in code or compile-time, but in code is preferred. Would a rule like this someday be feasible and/or desirable?:

Title: Preprocessing identifiers should be defined in the code

\[~ann.campbell.2] IMO the two ways serve different purposes.

* You define a macro directly in code when you want to unconditionally enable or disable some features found in a library. A typical example is the LEAN_AND_MEAN macro on Windows.
* You define a macro on the command line to conditionally change the behaviour of the compilation (e.g. target 32bits vs 64bits, or windows vs unix-like).
Detecting if a macro was defined in code or on the command line is feasible. Understanding why it was done this way is not.

We could however write a rule to check if a macro defined on the command line is redefined in code, because in this case the former definition is lost.
