== Why is this an issue?

When a source file grows too much, it accumulates numerous responsibilities and becomes challenging to understand and maintain. 

Above a specific threshold, refactor the file into smaller files whose code focuses on well-defined tasks. Those smaller files will be easier to understand and test.
