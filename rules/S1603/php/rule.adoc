== Why is this an issue?

In PHP 4, any function with the same name as the nesting class was considered a class constructor. In PHP 5, this mechanism has been deprecated and the ``++__construct++`` method name should be used instead. If both styles are present in the same class, PHP 5 will treat the function named ``++__construct++`` as the class constructor. 


This rule rule raises an issue for each method with the same name as the enclosing class.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
class Foo {
  function Foo(){...}
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
class Foo {
  function __construct(){...}
}
----
