== Why is this an issue?

Because the value in a variable of an unsigned type can never be less than zero, testing to see if it is negative is a useless operation which can only confuse future readers of the code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
unsigned int i = 0; // the lowest value this var can have
...
if (i >= 0) { // Noncompliant
  do_x(i);
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
unsigned int i = 0;
...
do_x(i);
----
