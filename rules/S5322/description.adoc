In Android applications, receiving intents is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerability:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1677[CVE-2019-1677]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1275[CVE-2015-1275]

Once a receiver is registered, any app can broadcast potentially malicious intents to your application.


This rule raises an issue when a receiver is registered without specifying any "broadcast permission".
