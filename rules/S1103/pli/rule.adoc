Defining a nested single-line comment within a multi-line comment invites errors. It may lead a developer to wrongly think that the lines located after the single-line comment are not part of the comment.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
/*
  This is a comment block, for which the ending tag was omitted
  It may be difficult to figure out that the following line of code is actually commented


variable = function_call();
/* variable contains the result, this is not allowed, as it is an attempt to create an inner comment */
