This rule is a pure Misra-C rule, and should be retargeted as such. RSPEC-811 & RSPEC-812, together, cover the same situation for Misra-{cpp}.


We need a SonarSource rule that corers the same situation, but with some differences: 

* One rule for both languages, that covers all cases
* Allow also pointer validity checks ``++T* p = f(); if(p) ...++``?
* Allow class types with explicit conversion to bool ``++unique_ptr<T> p = f(); if (p) ...++``?
* ...

We will wait to have started a real Misra initiative to do this.
