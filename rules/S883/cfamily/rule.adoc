== Why is this an issue?

Where a data value is to be tested against zero then the test should be made explicit. The exception to this rule is when data represents a Boolean value, even though in C this will in practice be an integer.


This rule is in the interests of clarity, and makes clear the distinction between integers and logical values.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
if ( x ) // Noncompliant, unless x is effectively Boolean data
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
if ( x == 0) // Compliant solution
----

* MISRA C:2004, 13.2 - Tests of a value against zero should be made explicit, unless the operand is effectively Boolean.
