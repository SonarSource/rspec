\[~ann.campbell.2] WDYT if we change this rule to not function scope but to java-like scopes (function+loops+if)?

Following to this convention will ease transition to ES2015 variables declarations (let and const)

\[~ann.campbell.2] I removed part about functions as it probably will produce FP. See

----
var y;   // OK

function foo(p) {

    bar(y);

  y = p;
}

for (var j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
  foo(j)

\[~ann.campbell.2] Looks like after removing this "function" thing this rule has not  much in common with RSPEC-1899. May be we should make it as separate RSPEC, WDYT? (cc [~pierre-yves.nicolas])
