In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as "K&R", served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as K&R C. 


The K&R function definition syntax introduced in the book was later deprecated in the ANSI C and ISO C standards. Even though the K&R syntax is still supported in the ISO C11 standard, it's not in ISO {cpp} standard versions and is not considered readable by most C/{cpp} developers today. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int foo(a, b)   // Noncompliant K&R C syntax
  int a;
  char* b;
{
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int foo(int a, char* b) { // Compliant
}
----
