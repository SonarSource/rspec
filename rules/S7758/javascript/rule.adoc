This is an issue when using `String#charCodeAt()` or `String.fromCharCode()` methods, which don't properly handle Unicode characters that require surrogate pairs.

== Why is this an issue?

JavaScript strings use UTF-16 encoding internally. Some Unicode characters, like emojis and certain international characters, require two 16-bit code units (called surrogate pairs) to represent a single character.

The older methods `charCodeAt()` and `fromCharCode()` work with individual UTF-16 code units. When dealing with characters that use surrogate pairs, these methods only process the first code unit, leading to incorrect results.

For example, the emoji 'ðŸ¦„' (unicorn) has the Unicode code point U+1F984. In UTF-16, this becomes a surrogate pair. Using `charCodeAt(0)` only returns the first part of this pair, not the complete character code.

The newer methods `codePointAt()` and `fromCodePoint()` understand Unicode code points properly. They handle surrogate pairs correctly and return the actual Unicode code point value, ensuring your application works correctly with international text and emojis.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using the wrong methods can cause:

* Incorrect character processing for emojis and international characters
* Data corruption when converting between characters and numeric codes
* Poor user experience for users with non-ASCII names or content
* Inconsistent behavior across different Unicode characters

=== How to fix?


Replace `charCodeAt()` with `codePointAt()` to get the correct Unicode code point value.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const code = 'ðŸ¦„'.charCodeAt(0); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const code = 'ðŸ¦„'.codePointAt(0);
----
