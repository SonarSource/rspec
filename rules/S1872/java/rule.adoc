== Why is this an issue?

There is no requirement that class names be unique, only that they be unique within a package. Therefore trying to determine an object's type based on its class name is an exercise fraught with danger. One of those dangers is that a malicious user will send objects of the same name as the trusted class and thereby gain trusted access.

Instead, the ``++instanceof++`` operator or the ``++Class.isAssignableFrom()++`` method should be used to check the object's underlying type.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
package computer;
class Pear extends Laptop { ... }

package food;
class Pear extends Fruit { ... }

class Store {

  public boolean hasSellByDate(Object item) {
    if ("Pear".equals(item.getClass().getSimpleName())) {  // Noncompliant
      return true;  // Results in throwing away week-old computers
    }
    return false;
  }

  public boolean isList(Class<T> valueClass) {
    if (List.class.getName().equals(valueClass.getName())) {  // Noncompliant
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
class Store {

  public boolean hasSellByDate(Object item) {
    if (item instanceof food.Pear) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  public boolean isList(Class<T> valueClass) {
    if (valueClass.isAssignableFrom(List.class)) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}

My feedback @Ann:

* I would have limited the scope of this rule to Java and Groovy because on my side I would not be able to say if this rule is relevant or not in {cpp}, C#, VB.Net, ...
* In the provided example in Java, I would have used the Class.getName() method and not Class.getSimpleName() which is not so widely used.
* The following extended description provided in the CWE page is for me really relevant to understand why this might be a security issue: 
____
If the decision to trust the methods and data of an object is based on the name of a class, it is possible for malicious users to send objects of the same name as trusted classes and thereby gain the trust afforded to known classes and types.

* I did some research at the time (& just ran through it again). All of those languages have classes and some equivalent of instanceof
* The example doesn't work with Class.getName() :-)
* I've beefed up the description.
