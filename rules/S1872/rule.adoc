== Why is this an issue?

There is no requirement that class names be unique, only that they be unique within a package. Therefore trying to determine an object's type based on its class name is an exercise fraught with danger. One of those dangers is that a malicious user will send objects of the same name as the trusted class and thereby gain trusted access. 


Instead, the ``++instanceof++`` operator should be used to check the object's underlying type.
