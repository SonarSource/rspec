The bitwise operators ``++&++``, ``++|++`` can be mistaken for the boolean operators ``++&&++`` and ``++||++``. 


This rule raises an issue when ``++&++`` or ``++|++`` is used in a boolean context.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (a & b) { ... } // Noncompliant; & used in error
----


== Compliant Solution

----
if (a && b) { ... }
----


== Exceptions

When a file contains other bitwise operations, (``++^++``, ``++<<++``, ``++>>>++``, ``++>>++``, ``++~++``, ``++&=++``, ``++^=++``, ``++|=++``, ``++<<=++``, ``++>>=++``, ``++>>>=++`` and ``++&++`` or ``++|++`` used with a numeric literal as the right operand) all issues in the file are ignored, because it is evidence that bitwise operations are truly intended in the file.
