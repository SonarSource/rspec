== Why is this an issue?

The `#include` directive is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to insert the contents of a file in the source code.

However, the standard only allows the `#include` directive to be followed by angle brackets (`<filename.h>`) or double quotes (`"filename.h"`).

If the `#include` directive contains macro names, the result of their expansion must also follow this rule:

[source,cpp]
----
#define HEADER "filename.h"
#include HEADER // Compliant
----

The behavior is undefined if neither angle brackets nor double quotes follow the `#include` directive.
