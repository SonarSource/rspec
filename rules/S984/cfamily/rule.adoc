The use of dynamic memory can lead to out-of-storage run-time failures, which are undesirable.


The built-in ``++new++`` and ``++delete++`` operators, other than the placement versions, use dynamic heap memory. The functions ``++calloc++``, ``++malloc++``, ``++realloc++`` and ``++free++`` also use dynamic heap memory.


There is a range of unspecified, undefined and implementation-defined behaviour associated with dynamic memory allocation, as well as a number of other potential pitfalls. Dynamic heap memory allocation may lead to memory leaks, data inconsistency, memory exhaustion, non-deterministic behaviour, etc.


Note that some implementations may use dynamic heap memory allocation to implement other functions (for example, functions in the library ``++cstring++``). If this is the case, then these functions shall also be avoided.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int *b;
void initialize()
{
  b = (int*) malloc(1024 * sizeof(int)); // Noncompliant, could lead to an out-of-storage run-time failure.
  if (b == 0)
  {
    // handle case when dynamic allocation failed.
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int b[1024]; // Compliant solution.
