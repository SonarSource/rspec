Nested ``++If++``, ``++Select++``, ``++For++``, ``++For Each++``, ``++While++``, ``++Do++``, and ``++Try++`` statements are key ingredients for making what's known as "Spaghetti code".

Such code is hard to read, refactor and therefore maintain.

== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default threshold of 3:

----
If condition1 ' Compliant - depth = 1
  ' ...
  If condition2 ' Compliant - depth = 2
    ' ...
    For i = 0 to 10 ' Compliant - depth = 3, not exceeding the limit
      ' ...
      If condition4 ' Noncompliant - depth = 4 
        If condition5 ' Depth = 5, exceeding the limit, but issues are only reported on depth = 4
          ' ...
        End If
        Return
      End If
    Next
  End If
End If
