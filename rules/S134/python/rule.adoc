Nested ``++if++``, ``++for++``, ``++while++``, ``++try++``, and ``++with++`` statements are key ingredients for making what's known as "Spaghetti code". Such code is hard to read, refactor and therefore maintain.

== Noncompliant Code Example

The following code snippet illustrates this rule with the default threshold of 3.

----
  if condition1:           # Compliant - depth = 1
    # ...
    if condition2:         # Compliant - depth = 2
      # ...
      for i in range(10):  # Compliant - depth = 3, not exceeding the limit
        # ...
        if condition4:     # Non-Compliant - depth = 4
          if condition5:   # Depth = 5, exceeding the limit, but issues are only reported on depth = 4
            # ...
