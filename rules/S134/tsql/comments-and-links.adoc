\[~freddy.mallet] we haven't (yet) deprecated this rule in favor of Cognitive Complexity, but do we want to continue adding new implementations?

I would say yes [~ann.campbell.2] because for me the best way to get a massive adoption of the Cognitive Complexity metric is by not forcing anyone to use it. This rule is a good example of a basic feature that any developer not knowing the cognitive complexity metric would expect from a rule engine. And I think that would be a mistake to generate a kind of friction at the adoption of the rule engine by forcing people to "buy" the Cognitive Complexity metric. But promoting the Cognitive Complexity rule/metric in the description of this rule can be a good idea.
