== Why is this an issue?

Nested ``++if++``, ``++for++``, ``++do++``, ``++while++``, ``++switch++`` and ``++try++`` statements is a key ingredient for making what's known as "Spaghetti code".

Such code is hard to read, refactor and therefore maintain.

=== Noncompliant code example

With the default threshold of 3:

[source,cpp]
----
  if (condition1) {                  // Compliant; depth = 1
    /* ... */
    if (condition2) {                // Compliant; depth = 2
      /* ... */
      for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  // Compliant; depth = 3, not exceeding the limit
        /* ... */
        if (condition4) {            // Noncompliant; depth = 4
          if (condition5) {          // Depth = 5, exceeding the limit, but issues are only reported on depth = 4
            /* ... */
          }
          return;
        }
      }
    }
  }
----

=== Exceptions

Each use of a macro containing control flow statements is counted as one nesting level, even if the macro contains more than one control flow statement.

[source,cpp]
----
  #define FOREACH(V,ARR) if(ARR!=nullptr) for(int V=0; V<(sizeof(ARR)/sizeof(ARR[0])); V++)

  if (condition1) {       // Compliant; depth = 1
    if (condition2) {     // Compliant; depth = 2
      FOREACH(i, arr) {     // Compliant; depth = 3 (not 4)
        if (condition3) {   // Noncompliant; depth = 4
          /* ... */
        }
      }
    }
  }

I added an "Exception" paragraph to describe how we count depth with macro.

\[~alban.auzeill] the exception isn't clear to me as currently written. Typically in an exception code block you'd show a "noncompliant" piece of code that's actually ignored because of the exception. So, could you expand the example?
