The `suspend` function modifier is used to mark a function which might take some time to execute and could suspend the caller coroutine. The location where such function is called is a "suspension point". Functions marked as `suspend` ("suspending functions") should themselves contain at least one suspension point, otherwise it makes no sense to mark it as `suspend`

This rule reports an issue if a function with `suspend` modifier has no calls to other `suspend` functions inside its body.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
suspend fun function() { // Noncompliant, redundant 'suspend' modifier
    println("Hello!")
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
fun function() {
    println("Hello!")
}
----
