== Why is this an issue?

The ``++SafeHandle++`` class provides a simpler and safer way to manage the life cycle of objects which contains un-managed pointers (``++IntPtr++``). When converting to ``++SafeHandle++`` all calls to ``++GC.KeepAlive++`` should be removed because they become unnecessary and could confuse maintainers if left in the code.


This rule raises an issue when a class is using ``++SafeHandle++`` and still contains calls to ``++GC.KeepAlive++``.
