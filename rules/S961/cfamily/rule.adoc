== Why is this an issue?

This is a constraint error, but preprocessors have been known to ignore this problem. Each argument in a function-like macro must consist of at least one preprocessing token otherwise the behaviour is undefined.


== Resources

* MISRA C:2004, 19.8 - A function-like macro shall not be invoked without all of its arguments.
* https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/628[MITRE, CWE-628] - Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments
