== Why is this an issue?

The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by summing the number of ``++and++``, ``++or++`` and ``++xor++`` operators, the number of control flow statement like ``++IF++``, ``++WHILE++``, ``++DO++``, ``++RETURN++`` ... in the body of a class plus one for each method. Even when the Cyclomatic Complexity of a class is very high, this complexity might be well distributed among all methods. Nevertheless, most of the time, a very complex class is a class which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle and which should be re-factored to be split in several classes.
