=== How to fix it in Python Standard Library

The following noncompliant code is vulnerable to Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS)
because untrusted data is used as a regex to scan a string without prior
sanitization or validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
from flask import request
import re

@app.route('/lookup')
def lookup():
  regex = request.args['regex']
  data = request.args['data']

  re.search(regex, data) # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
from flask import request
import re

@app.route('/lookup')
def lookup():
  regex = request.args['regex']
  data = request.args['data']

  re.search(re.escape(regex), data)
----

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/validation.adoc[]

In the compliant solution, `re.escape` escapes metacharacters and escape sequences that
could have broken the initially intended logic.
