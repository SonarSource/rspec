== How to fix it in .NET

=== Code examples

The following noncompliant code is vulnerable to Regex Denial of Service
because untrusted data is used as a regex to scan a string without prior
sanitization or validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Public Function Validate(regex As String, input As String) As IActionResult
        Dim match As Boolean = Regex.IsMatch(input, regex)

        Return Json(match)
    End Function
End Class
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Public Function Validate(regex As String, input As String) As IActionResult
        Dim match As Boolean = Regex.IsMatch(input, Regex.Escape(regex))

        Return Json(match)
    End Function
End Class
----

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/validation.adoc[]

In the compliant solution example, `Regex.Escape` escapes metacharacters and escape sequences that
could have broken the initially intended logic.
