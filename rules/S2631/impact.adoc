=== What is the possible impact?

In the context of a web application vulnerable to regex pattern injection: +
After discovering the injection point, attackers inject data into the
vulnerable field to make the application inaccessible.


Depending on the application's software architecture and the injection point's
location, the impact may or may not be visible.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Self Denial of Service

In cases where the complexity of the regular expression is exponential to the
input size, a small, carefully-crafted input (for example, 20 chars) can
trigger `catastrophic backtracking` and cause a denial of service of the
application. 

`Super-linear regex complexity` can produce the same effects for a large,
carefully crafted input (thousands chars).

If the component jeopardized by this vulnerability is not a bottleneck that
acts as a single point of failure (SPOF) within the application, the denial of
service might only affect the attacker who initiated it.

Such benign denial of service can also occur in architectures that rely heavily
on containers and container orchestrators. Replication systems would detect the
failure of a container and automatically replace it.

==== Widespread Denial of Service

However, two critical scenarios can also happen:

* When the injection is performed in a SPOF component that acts as a bottleneck.
* When the attacker (or a group of attackers) performs a Distributed Denial of Service.

In both scenarios, the attacker intends to block the regular operation of the
enterprise.

In the first case, the means used are simple and exploit the single point of
failure, which is a software architecture weakness.

In the second case, which is less likely, the deployed means aim to exhaust the
infrastructure by sending as much malicious payload as possible, using enormous
offensive infrastructures.

These threats are particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not
maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).
