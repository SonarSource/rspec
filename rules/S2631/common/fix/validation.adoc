==== Sanitization and validation


The easiest way to protect against regex injections is to escape metacharacters and escape sequences, preferably
with native functions.


As an alternative, create a list of authorized and secure strings that you want the application to
be able to use in a query. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.


*Important Note*: The application must validate on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
