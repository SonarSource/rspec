==== Sanitization and Validation

Metacharacters escape using native functions is a solution against regex
injection. + 
The escape function sanitizes the input so that the regular expression
engine interprets these characters literally.

An allowlist approach can also be used by creating a list containing
authorized and secure strings you want the application to use in a query. + 
If a user
input does not match an entry in this list, it should be considered unsafe and
rejected.

*Important Note*: The application must sanitize and validate on the server side. Not on
client-side front end.

Where possible, use _non-backtracking_ regex engines, for example, Google's
