==== Sanitization and validation

As a rule of thumb, the best approach to protecting against injections is to
systematically ensure that untrusted data cannot break out of its initially
intended logic.

For regex pattern injections, the easiest way to protect against this
vulnerability is to escape metacharacters and escapes sequences, preferably
with native functions.

Another clean method is to validate the input before using it to scan a string.

Create a list of authorized and secure strings that you want the application to
be able to use in a query. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.

The list can be either a regex string, an array, or validators on specific
ranges of characters. If you use regexes, choose simple regexes to avoid ReDOS
attacks.

*Important Note*: The application must validate on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
