==== Sanitization and Validation

Metacharacters escape using native functions is a solution against regex injection. +
The escape function sanitizes the input so that the regular expression engine interprets these
characters literally.

An allowlist approach can also be used by creating a list containing authorized and secure strings you want the application to use in a query. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be considered unsafe and rejected.

*Important Note*: The application must sanitize and validate on the server side. Not on
client-side front end.

Where possible, the usage of regex engines with a deterministic finite
automata (DFA) design that do not backtrack should be preferred, for example, Google's
