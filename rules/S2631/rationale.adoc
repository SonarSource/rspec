Regular expression pattern injections occur when the application retrieves
untrusted data and uses it as a regex pattern to scan a string with it.

Most regular expression search engines use `backtracking` to try all possible
regex execution paths when evaluating an input. Sometimes this can lead to
performance problems called `catastrophic backtracking situations`.
