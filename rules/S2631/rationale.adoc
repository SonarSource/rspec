Regular expression injections occur when the application retrieves
untrusted data and uses it as a regex to pattern match a string with it.

Most regular expression search engines use `backtracking` to try all possible
regex execution paths when evaluating an input. Sometimes this can lead to
performance problems also referred to as `catastrophic backtracking situations`.
