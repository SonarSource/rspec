Regular expression injections occur when the application retrieves
untrusted data and uses it as a regex to pattern match a string with it.

Most regular expression search engines use backtracking to try all possible
regex execution paths when evaluating an input. Sometimes this can lead to
performance problems also referred to as catastrophic backtracking situations.
