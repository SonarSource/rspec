== Why is this an issue?

``++emplace++`` and ``++insert++`` in ``++std::map++`` and ``++std::unordered_map++`` might construct the (key, value) pair, including the value object, even when it is not necessary.

``++emplace++`` destroys the constructed pair if the key is already present, wasting the effort on construction and destruction of the value.

If ``++insert++`` was called with a temporary, it leads to an extra copy or move construction and destruction of the temporary.


{cpp}17 introduced ``++try_emplace++`` that does not construct the value if the key is already present in the map and constructs the value in place if necessary.


In most cases, you should use ``++try_emplace++``. In particular, if two conditions hold:

* You are inserting a single object at a time.
* You are creating a new mapped-to value and/or (key, value) pair just to insert it into the map.

You should keep the ``++insert++`` if one of the conditions holds:

* The (key, value) pair is already constructed (for another purpose).
* You want to insert multiple (key, value) pairs with a single call.

You should keep ``++emplace++`` and ``++emplace_hint++`` if

* You use piecewise construction with ``++std::piecewise_construct++``.

This rule detects calls to ``++insert++`` that lead to the construction of a large temporary object, as well as calls to ``++emplace++`` and ``++emplace_hint++`` with no piecewise construction.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  std::map<int, std::string> bodies({{3, "Lorem ipsum..."}});
  bodies.emplace(3, "Lorem ipsum..."); // Noncompliant
  bodies.insert({3, "Lorem ipsum..."}); // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  std::map<int, std::string> bodies({{3, "Lorem ipsum..."}});
  bodies.try_emplace(3, "Lorem ipsum..."); // Compliant
  auto p = std::make_pair(3, "Lorem ipsum..."); // The (key, value) pair is already constructed for another purpose
  bodies.insert(p); // Compliant
  use_the_pair(p);
}
----


=== Exceptions

You should keep ``++insert++`` for exception safety if your mapped-to type is a smart pointer and the argument is a ``++new++`` expression.
