The ``++IntPtr++`` and ``++UIntPtr++`` types are used to access unmanaged memory, usually in order to use C or {cpp} libraries.  If such a pointer is not secured by making it ``++private++``, ``++internal++`` or ``++readonly++``, it can lead to a vulnerability allowing access to arbitrary locations.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  public class MyClass
  {
    public IntPtr myPointer;  // Noncompliant
    protected UIntPtr myOtherPointer; // Noncompliant
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  public class MyClass
  {
    private IntPtr myPointer;
    protected readonly UIntPtr myOtherPointer;
  }
}
----
