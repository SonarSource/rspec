== Why is this an issue?

``++echo++`` can be called with or without parentheses, but it is best practice to leave parentheses off the call because using parentheses with multiple arguments will result in a parse error.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
echo("Hello");  // Noncompliant, but it works
echo("Hello", "World"); // Noncompliant. Parse error
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
echo "Hello";
echo "Hello","World!";
----

@Ann, for me the "Compliant Solution" is misleading. I would replace it by :


----
echo "Hello";
echo "Hello", "World!"

Yes, [~freddy.mallet], thanks. I'm not assigning this one to you since you've apparently already reviewed it. :-)
