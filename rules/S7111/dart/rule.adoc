`part of` directives should be used with strings, rather than with `library` names.

== Why is this an issue?

Often Dart libraries are small enough to be entirely contained in a single file. 

However, when the file becomes too large and it's not possible to split the library into smaller libraries (as adviced by the Dart team in the note https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-packages#organizing-a-package[here]), Dart defines a
`part of` directive, which allows developers to split the library into multiple smaller chunks.

When a library is split into multiple files, each part has to refer the library it belongs to, and it can do so with two similar but alternative syntaxes:

* by name identifier: `part of my_library;`
* by a URI string: `part of 'my_library.dart';`

The second syntax is more precise and flexible, because it explicitely identifies the file that contains the main body of the library, whereas a reference by identifier needs to be resolved to a URI by the Dart compiler. 

=== What is the potential impact?

If the `part of` directive is used with a library name, the Dart compiler may resolve the library incorrectly, if multiple libraries with the same name but different paths exist in the package.

== How to fix it

Convert the name identifier into a string, append the `.dart` extension, and prepend the relative path.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
part of my_library;
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
part of '../my_library.dart';
----

== Implementation Specification
(visible only on this page)

=== Message

The part-of directive uses a library name.

=== Highlighting

The entire `part of` directive statement, including the semicolon: e.g. `part of my_library;`.
