Having all branches in a ``++match++`` or ``++if++`` chain with the same implementation is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be a ``++match++``/``++if++`` chain at all.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (b == 0) { // Noncompliant
  doSomething
} else {
  doSomething
}

i match { // Noncompliant
  case 1 => doSomething
  case 2 => doSomething
  case 3 => doSomething
  case _ => doSomething
}
----

== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to ``++if++`` chains without ``++else++``-s, or to ``++match++``-es without ``++case _++`` alternatives.


----
if (b == 0) {
  doSomething
} else if (b == 1) {
  doSomething
}
