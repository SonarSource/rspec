== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches in a `case` or `if` chain with the same implementation is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be a `case`/`if` chain at all.

[source,ruby]
----
if b == 0  # Noncompliant
  doOneMoreThing()
else
  doOneMoreThing()
end

b = a > 12 ? 4 : 4;  # Noncompliant

case i  # Noncompliant
  when 1
    doSomething()
  when 2
    doSomething()
  when 3
    doSomething()
  else 
    doSomething()
end
----

=== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to `if` chains nor `case` without `else`.


[source,ruby]
----
if b == 0 # no issue, this could have been done on purpose to make the code more readable
  doSomething()
elsif b == 1
  doSomething()
end
