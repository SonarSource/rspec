Having all branches in an ``++EVALUATE++`` or ``++IF++`` chain with the same implementation is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be an ``++EVALUATE++``/``++IF++`` chain at all.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
EVALUATE X *> Noncompliant
  WHEN 1
    PERFORM SECTION1
  WHEN OTHER
    PERFORM SECTION1
END-EVALUATE.

IF X = 1 THEN *> Noncompliant
  PERFORM SECTION1
ELSE
  PERFORM SECTION1
END-IF.
----

== Exceptions

Note that this rule does not apply to ``++IF++`` chains without ``++ELSE++``-s, or to ``++EVALUATE++``-s without ``++WHEN OTHER++`` clauses.


----
IF X = 1 THEN *> //no issue, this could have been done on purpose to make the code more readable
  PERFORM SECTION1
ELSE-IF X = 2 THEN
  PERFORM SECTION1
END-IF.
