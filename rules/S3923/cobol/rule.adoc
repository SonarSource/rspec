== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches of an `EVALUATE` or `IF` chain with the same implementation indicates a problem.

In the following code:

[source,cobol]
----
EVALUATE X *> Noncompliant
  WHEN 1
    PERFORM SECTION1
  WHEN OTHER
    PERFORM SECTION1
END-EVALUATE.

IF X = 1 THEN *> Noncompliant
  PERFORM SECTION1
ELSE
  PERFORM SECTION1
END-IF.
----

Either there is a copy-paste error that needs fixing or an unnecessary `EVALUATE` or `IF` chain that needs removing.

=== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to `IF` chains without `ELSE`, nor to `EVALUATE` without a `WHEN OTHER` clause.


[source,cobol]
----
IF X = 1 THEN *> //no issue, this could have been done on purpose to make the code more readable
  PERFORM SECTION1
ELSE-IF X = 2 THEN
  PERFORM SECTION1
END-IF.
