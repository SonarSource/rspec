== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches of a `CASE` or `IF`/`ELSIF` chain with the same implementation indicates a problem.

In the following code:

[source,sql]
----
IF param = 1 THEN
  result := 'A';
ELSIF param = 2 THEN
  result := 'A';
ELSE
  result := 'A';
END IF;

result := CASE param
   WHEN 1 THEN 'A'
   WHEN 2 THEN 'A'
   ELSE 'A'
END;
----

Either there is a copy-paste error that needs fixing or an unnecessary `CASE` or `IF`/`ELSIF` chain that needs removing.

=== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to `IF` or `CASE` chains without `ELSE` clauses.


[source,sql]
----
IF param = 1 THEN   -- no issue, this could have been done on purpose to make the code more readable
  result := 'A';
ELSIF param = 2 THEN
  result := 'A';
END IF;
