== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches in a ``++Select Case++`` or ``++If++`` chain with the same implementation is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be a ``++Select Case++`` / ``++If++`` chain at all.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Dim b As Integer = If(a > 12, 4, 4)

If b = 0 Then
    DoTheThing()
Else
    DoTheThing()
End If

Select Case i
    Case 1
        DoSomething()
    Case 2
        DoSomething()
    Case 3
        DoSomething()
    Case Else
        DoSomething()
End Select
----

=== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to ``++If++`` chains without ``++Else++``-s, or to ``++Select Case++``-es without ``++Case Else++`` clauses.


----
If b = 0 Then ' No issue, this could have been done on purpose to make the code more readable
    DoTheThing()
ElseIf
    DoTheThing()
End If
