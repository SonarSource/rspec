Having all branches in a ``++when++`` or ``++if++`` chain with the same implementation is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be a ``++when++``/``++if++`` chain at all.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (b == 0) {  // Noncompliant
     doOneMoreThing()
} else {
     doOneMoreThing()
}

when (i) {  // Noncompliant
    1 -> doSomething()
    2 -> doSomething()
    3 -> doSomething()
    else -> doSomething()
}
----

== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to ``++if++`` chains without ``++else++``-s, or to ``++when++``-es without ``++else++`` clauses.


----
if (b == 0) {
    doOneMoreThing()
} else if (b == 1) {
    doOneMoreThing()
}
