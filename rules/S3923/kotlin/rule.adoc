== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches in a `when` or `if` chain with the same implementation is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be a `when`/`if` chain at all.

[source,kotlin]
----
if (b == 0) {  // Noncompliant
     doOneMoreThing()
} else {
     doOneMoreThing()
}

when (i) {  // Noncompliant
    1 -> doSomething()
    2 -> doSomething()
    3 -> doSomething()
    else -> doSomething()
}
----

=== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to `if` chains without `else`, nor to `when` without an `else` clause.


[source,kotlin]
----
if (b == 0) {
    doOneMoreThing()
} else if (b == 1) {
    doOneMoreThing()
}
