== Why is this an issue?

Having the same implementation in every branch of an ``++if++`` chain is an error. Either a copy-paste error was made and something different should be executed, or there shouldn't be an ``++if++`` chain at all.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
if b == 0:  # Noncompliant
    doOneMoreThing()
elif b == 1:
    doOneMoreThing()
else:
    doOneMoreThing()

b = 4 if a > 12 else 4  # Noncompliant
----

=== Exceptions

This rule does not apply to ``++if++`` chains without ``++else++``-s.


----
if b == 0:  # no issue, this could have been done on purpose to make the code more readable
    doOneMoreThing()
elif b == 1:
    doOneMoreThing()
