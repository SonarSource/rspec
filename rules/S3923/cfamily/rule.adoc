== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches of an `if` chain, `switch` statement or ternary operator with the same implementation indicates a problem. The conditional structure is pointless, because the same code will be executed regardless of the conditions.

In the following code:

include::../common/code-example.adoc[]

Either there is a copy-paste error that should be fixed; or the `if` chain, `switch` statement or ternary operator is unecessary and should be removed.

=== Considerations

_All branches_ includes the default branch, which is the branch that is executed when none of the conditions of the structure are satisfied. This branch may present itself explicitly, implicitly or by construction.

[source,cpp]
----
if (a == 0) b == 1;
else b == 2; // explicit default branch

int func() {
  if (a == 0) return 1;
  return 2; // implicit default branch
}

switch (a) {
  case 0:
    return 1;
  default: // explicit default branch
    return 2;
}

int b = a == 0 ? 1 : 2;
                  // ^ default branch by construction
