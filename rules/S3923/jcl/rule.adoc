== Why is this an issue?

Having all branches of a `IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF` statement with the same implementation indicates a problem.

In the following code:

[source,jcl]
----
//IFSTMT1 IF STEP01.RC = 0 THEN
//STEP1   EXEC PROC=DOTHING
//        ELSE
//STEP1   EXEC PROC=DOTHING
//        ENDIF
----

Either there is a copy-paste error that needs fixing or an unnecessary IF chain that needs removing.
