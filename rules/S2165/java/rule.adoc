== Why is this an issue?

There is no point in setting class fields to ``++null++`` in a finalizer. If this this is a hint to the garbage collector, it is unnecessary - the object will be garbage collected anyway - and doing so may actually cause extra work for the garbage collector.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class Foo {
  private String name;

  @Override
  void finalize() {
    name = null;  // Noncompliant; completely unnecessary
  }
}
