== Why is this an issue?

Accessing a {null-keyword-link}[{null-keyword}] value will always throw a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullreferenceexception[NullReferenceException] most likely causing the application to terminate abruptly.

Such termination might expose sensitive information that a malicious third party could exploit to, for instance, bypass security measures.

=== Exceptions

There is some scenario to which this rule won't raise:

* calls to extension methods are not reported because they can still operate on `{null-keyword}` values.
+
include::{exceptionCode1}[]
* value has been previously validated by creating a `ValidatedNotNull` or `NotNull` attribute and used on method parameter
+
include::{exceptionCode2}[]
* code is unreachable
+
include::{exceptionCode3}[]
