Ensuring the variable `MyObject` has a value resolves the issue:

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Sub Method()
    Dim MyObject As New Object
    Console.WriteLine(MyObject.ToString()) ' Compliant: 'MyObject' is not null
End Sub
----

Preventing the non-compliant code to be executed by returning early:

[source,vbnet,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Sub Method(Input As Object)
    If Input Is Nothing Then
        ' ...
        Return
    End If
    Console.WriteLine(Input.ToString()) ' Compliant: if 'Input' is null, this part is unreachable
End Sub
