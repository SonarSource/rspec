The variable `MyObject` is equal to `Nothing`, meaning it has no value:

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Sub Method()
    Dim MyObject As Object = Nothing
    Console.WriteLine(MyObject.ToString)   ' Noncompliant: 'MyObject' is always Nothing
End Sub
----

The parameter `Input` might be `Nothing` as suggested by the `if` condition:

[source,vbnet,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Sub Method(Input As Object)
    If Input Is Nothing Then
        ' ...
    End If
    Console.WriteLine(Input.ToString) ' Noncompliant: 'Input' might be Nothing
End Sub
