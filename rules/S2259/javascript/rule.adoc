== Why is this an issue?

In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are primitive values that do not have properties or methods. When accessing a property on a `null` or `undefined` value, JavaScript tries to access the property of an object that does not exist, which results in a `TypeError`.

This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly, which can be difficult to debug.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let foo = null;
console.log(foo.bar); // Noncompliant: TypeError will be thrown
----

Use the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if a variable is truthy before attempting to access its properties. The expression will short-circuit and return the falsy value instead of attempting to access its properties.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let foo = null;
console.log(foo && foo.bar);
----

Alternatively, use the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to check if the variable is `null` or `undefined` before attempting to access its property. This operator is more readable and concise, especially when dealing with nested properties.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let foo = null;
console.log(foo?.bar);
----

We could make this rule also cover invalid function calls, e.g.:

----
var x = 42;
x(); // Noncompliant: TypeError will be thrown

However, there may be some overlap with RSPEC-2999.
