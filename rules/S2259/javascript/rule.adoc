== Why is this an issue?

When a variable is assigned an ``++undefined++`` or ``++null++`` value, it has no properties. Trying to access properties of such a variable anyway results in a ``++TypeError++``, causing abrupt termination of the script if the error is not caught in a ``++catch++`` block. But instead of ``++catch++``-ing this condition, it is best to avoid it altogether.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
if (x === undefined) {
  console.log(x.bar); // Noncompliant; TypeError will be thrown
}
----

We could make this rule also cover invalid function calls, e.g.:

----
var x = 42;
x(); // Noncompliant: TypeError will be thrown

However, there may be some overlap with RSPEC-2999.
