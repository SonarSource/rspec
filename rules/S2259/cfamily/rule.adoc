Dereferencing a null pointer results in the undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

A pointer to null, known also as a null pointer, is created by initializing a pointer object to `0`, `NULL`, or in the case of C++ `nullptr`.
Such a pointer does not point to an object or valid memory, and as a consequence dereferencing or accessing the memory pointed by such a pointer has undefined behavior.

[source,c]
----
int deref() {
  int* ptr = 0;
  return *ptr; // Noncompliant, deference of null pointer
}
----

In addition to using an `*` operator, accessing a member of the structure (using `->`) or element of an array (using `[]`) leads to dereference of the pointer,
and cause undefined behavior if performed on a pointer to null.

[source,c]
----
int subscript() {
  int* ptr = 0;
  return ptr[2]; // Noncompliant, subscript of null pointer
}
----

[source,c]
----
struct Aggregate {
  int x;
  int y;
};

int memberAccess() {
  struct Aggregate* ptr = 0;
  return ptr->x; // Noncompliant, member access on a null pointer
}
----

Finally, invoking a function pointer that points to null, dereferences the pointer and results in undefined behavior.
[source,c]
----
void call() {
  void (*func)(int) = NULL; // func is pointer to function
  func(10); // Noncompliant, invocation of null function pointer 
}
----

== What is the potential impact?

The behavior of a program that deferences a null pointer results in undefined behavior, 
In such case the compiler no longer needs to adhere to the language standard, 
and the program has no meaning assigned to it.

In practice dereference of null pointer may lead to program crashes, or the application may appear to execute correctly while losing data or producing incorrect results.

Besides affecting the application's availability, null pointer dereferences may lead to code execution, in rare circumstances.
If null is equivalent to the ``++0x0++`` memory address that can be accessed by privileged code, writing, and reading memory is possible, which compromises the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

== Hot to fix it

Ensure that any pointer that is dereferenced by the program _is not_ null.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
char *p1 = ... ;
if (p1 == NULL && *p1 == '\t') { // Noncompliant, p1 will be dereferenced IFF it is null
  // ...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
char *p1 = ... ;
if (p1 != NULL && *p1 == '\t') { // Compliant, *p1 cannot be evaluated when p1 is NULL
  // ...
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
char *p2 = ... ;
if (p2 != NULL) {
    // ...
}
p2[2] = '\t'; // Noncompliant; potential null-dereference
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,c,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
char *p2 = ... ;
if (p2 != NULL) {
    // ...
  p2[2] = '\t'; // Compliant
}
----

=== Going the extra mile

In {cpp}, it is preferred to use reference parameter (`Type const&` or `Type&`), or passing object by value (`Type`),
instead of a pointer (`Type const*` or `Type*`), when the argument is expected to never be null.

[source,cpp]
----
// Precondition: graph != null
bool isDAG(Graph const* graph);
---- 

The preferred signature would be:

[source,cpp]
----
bool isDAG(Graph const& graph);
----
