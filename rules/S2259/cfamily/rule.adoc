Dereferencing a null pointer results in undefined behavior.

== Why is this an issue?

A pointer to null, also known as a null pointer, is created by initializing a pointer object to `0`, `NULL`, or in the case of C++ `nullptr`.
A null pointer does neither point to an object nor to valid memory, and as a consequence dereferencing or accessing the memory pointed by such a pointer is undefined behavior.

[source,c]
----
int deref() {
  int* ptr = 0;
  return *ptr; // Noncompliant: deference of a null pointer
}
----

In addition to using the `*` operator, accessing a member of a structure (using `->`) or an element of an array (using `[]`) also leads to dereference of the pointer,
and causes undefined behavior if performed on a pointer to null.

[source,c]
----
int subscript() {
  int* ptr = 0;
  return ptr[2]; // Noncompliant: subscript operator used on null pointer
}
----

[source,c]
----
struct Aggregate {
  int x;
  int y;
};

int memberAccess() {
  struct Aggregate* ptr = 0;
  return ptr->x; // Noncompliant: member access on a null pointer
}
----

Finally, invoking a function pointer that holds a null value, dereferences the pointer, and too results in undefined behavior.
[source,c]
----
void call() {
  void (*func)(int) = NULL; // func is a pointer to a function
  func(10); // Noncompliant: the invocation of a null function pointer 
}
----

== What is the potential impact?

The behavior of a program that dereferences a null pointer is undefined.
In that case, the compiler no longer needs to adhere to the language standard
and the program has no meaning assigned to it.

In practice, dereferencing a null pointer may lead to program crashes, or the application may appear to execute correctly while losing data or producing incorrect results.

Besides affecting the application's availability, null pointer dereferences may lead to code execution, in rare circumstances.
If null is equivalent to the ``++0x0++`` memory address that can be accessed by privileged code, writing, and reading memory is possible, which compromises the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

== How to fix it

Ensure that any pointer that is dereferenced by the program _is not_ null.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
char *p1 = ... ;
if (p1 == NULL && *p1 == '\t') { // Noncompliant: p1 will be dereferenced IFF it is null
  // ...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,c,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
char *p1 = ... ;
if (p1 != NULL && *p1 == '\t') { // Compliant: *p1 cannot be evaluated if p1 is NULL
  // ...
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,c,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
char *p2 = ... ;
if (p2 != NULL) {
    // ...
}
p2[2] = '\t'; // Noncompliant: potential null-dereference
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,c,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
char *p2 = ... ;
if (p2 != NULL) {
    // ...
  p2[2] = '\t'; // Compliant: p2 is known to be non-null
}
----
