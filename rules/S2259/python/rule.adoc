== Why is this an issue?

Attributes of ``++None++`` values should never be accessed. Doing so will cause an ``++AttributeError++`` to be thrown. At best, such an exception will cause abrupt program termination. At worse, it could expose debugging information that would be useful to an attacker, or it could allow an attacker to bypass security measures.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
def myfunc(param):
    if param is None:
        print(param.test())  # Noncompliant

    if param == None:
        print(param.test())  # Noncompliant

    if param is not None:
        pass
    else:
        print(param.test())  # Noncompliant

    if param != None:
        pass
    else:
        print(param.test())  # Noncompliant
