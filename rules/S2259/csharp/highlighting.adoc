Primary : the variable on which a function call can lead to a null pointer dereference (if this value is the output of another function call, this other function call must be highlighted instead)

Secondary : the last locations in the code where the nullability condition has been set on the variable. The associated location message should be either :

* So "xxxx" is null
* So "xxxx" is nullable
