Nullable value types can hold either a value or `null`. The value held in the nullable type can be accessed with the `Value` property or by casting it to the underlying type, but both operations throw an `InvalidOperationException` when the value is `null`. To avoid the exception, a nullable type should always be tested before the value is accessed.
