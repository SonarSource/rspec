Nullable value types can hold either a value or `+null+`. The value held in the nullable type can be accessed with the `+Value+` property, but `+.Value+` throws an `+InvalidOperationException+` when the value is `+null+`. To avoid the exception, a nullable type should always be tested before `+.Value+` is accessed.
