Nullable value types can hold either a value or `null`. The value held in the nullable type can be accessed with the `Value` property or by casting it to the underlying type. Still, both operations throw an `InvalidOperationException` when the value is `null`. A nullable type should always be tested before the value is accessed to avoid the exception.
