Functions from the ``++std::cmp_*++`` family should be used to compare signed and unsigned values.

== Why is this an issue?

Comparisons between ``++signed++`` and ``++unsigned++`` integers are dangerous because they produce counterintuitive results outside of their shared value range.

When a signed integer is compared to an unsigned one, the former might be converted to unsigned.
The conversion preserves the two's-complement bit pattern of the signed value that often corresponds to a large unsigned result.
The expression ``++2U < -1++`` evaluates to ``++true++``, for instance.

{cpp}20 introduced remedy to this common pitfall: a family of ``++std::cmp_*++`` functions defined in the ``++<utility>++`` header:

* ``++std::cmp_equal++``
* ``++std::cmp_not_equal++``
* ``++std::cmp_less++``
* ``++std::cmp_greater++``
* ``++std::cmp_less_equal++``
* ``++std::cmp_greater_equal++``

These functions correctly handle negative numbers and are safe against lossy integer conversion.
For example, the comparison of ``++2U++`` and ``++-1++`` using ``++std::cmp_less(2U, -1)++`` evaluates to ``++false++`` and matches common intuition.


== What is the potential impact?

Comparisons between ``++signed++`` and ``++unsigned++`` integer types produce counterintuitive results.

Failing to understand integer conversion rules can lead to tricky bugs and security vulnerabilities.
The major integer conversion risks include narrowing types, converting from unsigned to signed and from negative to unsigned.

The following program shall demonstrate the subtlety of the kind of vulnerabilities that integer conversions may introduce.
The program is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to signed/unsigned integer conversion.

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc != 3) {
    printf("usage: <prog> <string length - int> <string - const char *>\n");
    return 1;
  }
  const int buf_size = 16;
  char buf[buf_size];
  int user_input = atoi(argv[1]);
  if (user_input >= buf_size) {
    return 1;
  }
  // Because `sizeof(*)` returns an unsigned integer, both operands are first
  // converted to unsigned integers, the multiplication is performed and the
  // result is of type unsigned integer.
  memcpy(buf, argv[2], user_input * sizeof(char));
  if (user_input == 0xBEEF) {
    printf("Whoopsie daisy, ...\n");
    // A malicious user can craft input arguments such that the flow of control
    // passes through this call to `execl` which opens a new shell with this
    // program's (possibly elevated) permissions.
    execl("/bin/bash", "bash", (char *)NULL);
  } else {
    printf("Not so fast!\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
----

The program takes as arguments a string and its size, and uses these arguments to copy the string argument into an internal buffer.
Before copying the string into its internal buffer it checks whether the user-provided string fits into the buffer.
The program also comprises a call to `execl` that opens a shell with the program's possibly elevated permissions -- a potentially dangerous endeavour.
Even though the call to `execl` seems unreachable at a first glance, it can actually be reached due to signed/unsigned integer conversion.

The check for the buffer size only validates that the provided string length (`user_input`) is smaller or equal to the buffer's size.
Since the `atoi` function returns a signed integer, a user may provide a negative number to withstand that check.
The result of `sizeof(*)` on the other hand returns an unsigned integer which causes the expression `user_input * sizeof(char)` to be evaluated by

  . converting both operands to unsigned integers,
  . performing the multiplication, and
  . returning the result as an unsigned integer type.

A malicious user is hence able to provide carefully crafted negative integer and string to bypass the size check while still arriving at the appropriate size argument to not crash `memcpy`.
This, in turn, enables the malicious user to overflow the buffer variable `buf` to override the `user_input` variable which allows the second `if` statement to be evaluated to true, eventually opening a new shell with the target program's possibly elevated permissions.


== How to fix it

Use the appropriate function from the ``++std::cmp_*++`` family to conduct comparisons between signed and unsigned integer types.


=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
bool foo(unsigned x, int y) {
  return x < y; // Noncompliant: y might be negative
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
bool foo(unsigned x, int y) {
  return std::cmp_less(x, y); // Compliant
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return x < v.size(); // Noncompliant: x might be negative
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return std::cmp_less(x, v.size()); // Compliant
}
----


== Interactions with associated rule S6214

Note that this rule (S6183) deliberately avoids intersection with S6214.

While S6214 raises an issue if the signed value can be proven to be negative (in which case it is definitely a bug), S6281 will flag all *other* comparisons between signed and unsigned integers.
Therefore, if this rule is enabled, S6214 should be enabled too.

The following code snippet is hence compliant with S6183, but noncompliant with S6214 which will raise an issue on this definite bug.

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
#include <iostream>

void foo() {
  if (2U < -1) { // Compliant: the comparison is incorrect but S6214 raises an issue instead of S6183
    std::cout << "2 is less than -1\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "2 is not less than -1\n";
  }
}
----

The fixed version of the code shown in the following is compliant with both rules, S6183 and S6214.

[source,cpp,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
#include <iostream>

void foo() {
  if (std::cmp_less(2U, -1)) { // Compliant: for this rule (S6183) and associated rule S6214
    std::cout << "2 is less than -1\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "2 is not less than -1\n";
  }
}
----
