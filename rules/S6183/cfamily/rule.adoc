== Why is this an issue?

Comparison between `signed` and `unsigned` integers is dangerous because it produces counterintuitive results outside of their common range of values.


When a signed integer is compared to an unsigned one, the former might be converted to unsigned. The conversion preserves the two's-complement bit pattern of the signed value that often corresponds to a large unsigned result. For example, `2U < -1` is `true`.


{cpp}20 introduced remedy to this common pitfall: a family of `std::cmp_*` functions defined in the `<utility>` header. These functions correctly handle negative numbers and lossy integer conversion. For example, `std::cmp_less(2U, -1)` is `false`.

This rule starts by detecting comparisons between signed and unsigned integers. Then, if the signed value can be proven to be negative, the rule S6214 will raise an issue (it is a bug). Otherwise, this rule will raise an issue. Therefore, if this rule is enabled, S6214 should be enabled too.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
bool less = 2U < -1; // Compliant, raises S6214

bool foo(unsigned x, signed y) {
  return x < y; // Noncompliant: y might be negative
}

bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return x < v.size(); // Noncompliant: x might be negative
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
bool less = std::cmp_less(2U, -1); // Compliant for this rule and S6214

bool foo(unsigned x, signed y) {
  return std::cmp_less(x, y); // Compliant
}

bool fun(int x, std::vector<int> const& v) {
  return std::cmp_less(x, v.size()); // Compliant
}

void compute(std::vector<int> const &v) {
  if (0 < v.size() && v.size() < 100) { // Compliant, even though v.size() returns an unsigned integer
  }
}
----
