This rule template allows to define rules that ban the call of some functions, for instance functions provided for legacy reasons. It will not prevent calling member functions or macros with the same name.

=== Noncompliant code example

Given parameters:

* names: f1, ::f2
* message: Don't call $

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  f1(); // Noncompliant: Don't call f1
  my::f1(); // Noncompliant: Don't call f1
  f2(); // Noncompliant: Don't call f2
  my::f2() // Compliant
}
----
