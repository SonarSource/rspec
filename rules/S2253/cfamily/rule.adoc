== Why is this an issue?

This rule template allows to define rules that ban the call of some functions, for instance functions provided for legacy reasons. It will not prevent calling member functions or macros with the same name.

It comes with two parameters:

* `names` defines a comma-separated list of function names to ban. You can specify a standalone name, in which case the rule will match functions with that name in any namespaces, or a qualified name (for instance, `print` will match `std::print`, but `::print` will not)
* `message` is the message to display when the rule is violated. If you use a `$` in that message, it will be replaced by the name of the function that was called.


=== Noncompliant code example

Given parameters:

* names: f1, ::f2
* message: Don't call $

[source,cpp]
----
void f() {
  f1(); // Noncompliant: Don't call f1
  my::f1(); // Noncompliant: Don't call f1
  f2(); // Noncompliant: Don't call f2
  my::f2() // Compliant
}
----
