== Why is this an issue?

The `ThreadGroup` class contains many deprecated methods like `allowThreadSuspension`, `resume`, `stop`, and `suspend`.
Also, some of the non-deprecated methods are obsolete or not thread-safe, and still others are insecure (`activeCount`, `enumerate`).
For these reasons, any use of `ThreadGroup` is suspicious and should be avoided.

== How to fix it

Use instead implementations of `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` to safely manage groups of threads.

=== Code examples

==== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
ThreadFactory threadFactory = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();
ThreadPoolExecutor executorPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(3, 10, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(2), threadFactory);

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  executorPool.execute(new JobThread("Job: " + i));
}

System.out.println(executorPool.getActiveCount()); // Compliant
executorPool.shutdown();
----
