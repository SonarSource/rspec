== Why is this an issue?

There is little valid reason to use the methods of the ``++ThreadGroup++`` class. Some are deprecated (``++allowThreadSuspension()++``, ``++resume()++``, ``++stop()++``, and ``++suspend()++``), some are obsolete, others aren't thread-safe, and still others are insecure (``++activeCount()++``, ``++enumerate()++``) . For these reasons, any use of ``++ThreadGroup++`` is suspicious and should be avoided.


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
ThreadFactory threadFactory = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();
ThreadPoolExecutor executorPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(3, 10, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(2), threadFactory);

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  executorPool.execute(new JobThread("Job: " + i));
}

System.out.println(executorPool.getActiveCount()); // Compliant
executorPool.shutdown();
