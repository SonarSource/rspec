If a lock is held or acquired and then released within a method, it should be released along all execution paths.

Failing to do so could make an application deadlock-prone because there is a risk of the lock not being released.

The types tracked by the rule are: `Monitor`, `Mutex`, `ReaderWriterLock`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, and `SpinLock` from the `System.Threading` namespace.

This rule raises an issue when a lock is acquired in a method but only released on some paths. No issue is raised when the lock is never released in the method. The assumption is that callers will release it.
