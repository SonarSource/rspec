If a lock is held or acquired and then released within a method, it should be released along all execution paths.

Failing to do so could make an application deadlock-prone because there is a risk of the lock not being released.

The types tracked by the rule are: `Monitor`, `Mutex`, `ReaderWriterLock`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim` and `SpinLock` from the `System.Threading` namespace.
