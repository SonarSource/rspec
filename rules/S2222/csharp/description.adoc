If a lock is known to be held or acquired, and then released within a method, then it must be released along all execution paths of that method.

Failing to do so will expose the conditional locking logic to the method's callers and hence be deadlock-prone.

The types tracked by the rule are: Monitor, Mutex, ReaderWriterLock, ReaderWriterLockSlim and SpinLock from the `System.Threading` namespace.
