If a lock is acquired and released within a method, then it must be released along all execution paths of that method.

Failing to do so could make an application deadlock-prone because there is a risk of the lock not being released.

The types tracked by the rule are: `Monitor`, `Mutex`, `ReaderWriterLock`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim` and `SpinLock` from the `System.Threading` namespace.
