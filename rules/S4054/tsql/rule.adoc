== Why is this an issue?

Using ``++TOP++`` in a ``++SELECT++`` without ordering the results from which the "top" results are chosen will return a seemingly random set of rows, and is surely a mistake.

The same random behavior also occurs when using ``++TOP++`` in a ``++DELETE++``, ``++INSERT++``, ``++UPDATE++`` and ``++MERGE++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,text]
----
SELECT TOP 10 -- Noncompliant selects 10 random rows
  fname, lname, city
  FROM people
  WHERE city IS NOT NULL;

DELETE TOP (10) -- Noncompliant deletes 10 random rows
  FROM PurchaseOrder
  WHERE DueDate < '20020701';
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,text]
----
SELECT TOP 10
  fname, lname, city
  FROM people
  WHERE city IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY birthdate;

DELETE
  FROM PurchaseOrder
  WHERE OrderID IN (
    SELECT TOP 10
      OrderID
      FROM PurchaseOrder
      WHERE DueDate < '20020701'
      ORDER BY DueDate ASC
  );

=== Message

Add an "ORDER BY" clause; without it, "TOP" will return rows selected at random.
