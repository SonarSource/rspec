\[~ann.campbell.2] I kinda lack the definition of what is a constant and limitation of cases to be 100% sure of the scope of this rule.

What about the following for instance :

int foo(boolean a) {
   if(a) {
     return 12;
   }
   return 12;
}

this is actually detected by intellij idea but the following is not : 

----
  int foo(boolean a) {
    int b = 12;
    if(a) {
      return b;
    }
    return b;
  }

IMO first implementation should be limited to method with only one return statement and a constant with the following definition:

A constant is a literal or a static final primitive variable. 


Then we might want to improve this using  SE engine to detect cases like I described.


WDYT ?
