There's no point in forcing the overhead of a function or method call for a function that always returns the same constant value. Even worse, the fact that a function call must be made will likely mislead developers who call the method thinking that something more is done. Declare a constant instead. 


This rule raises an issue on functions that contain only one  statement: the ``++return++`` of a constant value.

func getBestNumber() -> Int {
