WebViews can be used to display web content as part of a mobile application. A browser engine is used to render and display the content.
Like a web application a mobile application that uses WebViews can be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting if untrusted code is rendered.
In the context of a WebView JavaScript code can exfiltrate local files that might be sensitive or even worse, access exposed functions of the application that can result in more severe vulnerabilities such as code injection.
Thus JavaScript support should not be enabled for WebViews unless it is absolutely necessary and the authenticity of the web resources can be guaranteed.
