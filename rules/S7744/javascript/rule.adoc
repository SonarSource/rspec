An issue is raised when using a fallback empty object with the logical OR (`||`) or nullish coalescing (`??`) operators when spreading values in object literals.

== Why is this an issue?

When spreading values in JavaScript object literals, falsy values like `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, or empty strings are safely ignored and don't add any properties to the resulting object. This means that fallback patterns like `{...(foo || {})}` or `{...(foo ?? {})}` are unnecessary.

The JavaScript spread operator in object literals has built-in safety for falsy values. When you write `{...null}` or `{...undefined}`, no properties are added to the object, and no error is thrown. This makes defensive fallback objects redundant.

Using unnecessary fallbacks creates several problems:

* **Code bloat**: The extra fallback object adds unnecessary characters and complexity
* **Reduced readability**: The defensive pattern suggests there might be a real risk when there isn't one
* **Maintenance overhead**: More code to read, understand, and potentially modify
* **Performance impact**: Creating an empty object as a fallback has a small but unnecessary runtime cost

The pattern likely comes from developers being overly cautious or from experience with array spreading, where `[...null]` would indeed throw an error. However, object spreading behaves differently and is more forgiving.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue primarily affects code maintainability and readability. While not a security or reliability concern, unnecessary fallback objects make the codebase more verbose and can mislead other developers about the actual behavior of the spread operator in object literals.

=== How to fix?


Remove the unnecessary fallback empty object when spreading in object literals. The spread operator safely handles falsy values without throwing errors.

----
const object = {...(foo || {})}; // Noncompliant
