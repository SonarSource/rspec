== Why is this an issue?

{cpp}20 introduced a restricted form of designated initializers for aggregates (i.e., arrays or classes that respect specific criteria). Designated initializers enable the initialization of aggregates by naming their fields explicitly:

[source,cpp]
----
struct Point {
  float x = 0.0;
  float y = 0.0;
  float z = 0.0;
};

Point p = {
  .x = 1.0,
  .y = 2.0,
  // z will be 0.0
};
----

This initialization style is similar to designated initializers in C and many {cpp} compiler extensions predating {cpp}20.

However, it is more restricted because some forms are not supported by the {cpp}20 standard, namely:

* listing the fields out of order
* array initialization (including sparse array initialization)
* initialization of nested fields
* mixed initialization

This rule reports non-{cpp}-compliant forms of designated initializers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
struct A { int x, y; };
struct B { struct A a; };

struct A a = {.y = 1, .x = 2}; // Noncompliant: valid C, invalid C++ (out of order)
int arr[3] = {[1] = 5};        // Noncompliant: valid C, invalid C++ (array)
struct B b = {.a.x = 0};       // Noncompliant: valid C, invalid C++ (nested)
struct A c = {.x = 1, 2};      // Noncompliant: valid C, invalid C++ (mixed)
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
struct A { int x, y; };
struct B { struct A a; };

struct A a = {.x = 2, .y = 1};
int arr[3] = {0, 5};
struct B b = {.a = {.x = 0}};
struct A c = {.x = 1, .y = 2};
