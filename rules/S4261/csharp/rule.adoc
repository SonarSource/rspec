According to the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP), methods returning  either a ``++System.Threading.Tasks.Task++`` or a ``++System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult>++`` are considered "asynchronous". Such methods should use the ``++Async++`` suffix. Conversely methods which do not return such Tasks should not have an "Async" suffix in their names.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
using System;
using  System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace myLibrary
{

  public class Foo
  {
    public Task Read(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count, // Noncompliant
                                CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
using System;
using  System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace myLibrary
{

  public class Foo
  {
    public Task ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  }
}
----


== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an issue when the method is an override or part of the implementation of an interface since it can not be renamed.
