== Why is this an issue?

There are two possible syntaxes for a lambda having only one input parameter with an inferred type: with and without parentheses around that single parameter. The simpler syntax, without parentheses, is more compact and readable than the one with parentheses, and is therefore preferred.


*Note* that this rule is automatically disabled when the project's ``++sonar.java.source++`` is lower than ``++8++``.
