== Why is this an issue?

Lambda expressions with only one argument with an inferred type (i.e. no explicit type declaration) can be written without parentheses around that single parameter.
This syntax is simpler, more compact and readable than using parentheses and is therefore preferred.


*Note*: Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8, so this rule is automatically disabled when the project's `sonar.java.source` is lower than `8`.
