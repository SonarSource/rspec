== Why is this an issue?

``++RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR++`` may only be called with an error code from ``++-20,000++`` to ``++-20,999++``, which is the range reserved for application errors. When called with another value, Oracle raises the exception: ``++ORA-21000: error number argument to raise_application_error of 0 is out of range.++``


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN
  RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(0, 'This is an application error'); -- Non-Compliant - raises ORA-21000
END;
/
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN
  RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20000, 'This is an application error'); -- Compliant
END;
/
