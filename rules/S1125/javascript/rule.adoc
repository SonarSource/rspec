== Why is this an issue?

Comparing a boolean literal to a variable or expression that evaluates to a boolean value is unnecessary and can make the code harder to read and understand. Therefore, boolean literals should be avoided in equality comparison expressions (``++==++``, ``++===++``, ``++!=++``, and ``++!==++``) to improve code readability and reduce unnecessary clutter.

This rule also reports on redundant boolean operations.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
if (someValue === true) { /* ... */ } // Noncompliant: Redundant comparison
if (someBooleanValue !== true) { /* ... */ } // Noncompliant: Redundant comparison
if (booleanMethod() || false) { /* ... */ }  // Noncompliant: Redundant OR
doSomething(!false); // Noncompliant: Redundant negation
----

Remove redundant boolean literals to improve readability.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
if (someValue) { /* ... */ }
if (!someBooleanValue) { /* ... */ }
if (booleanMethod()) { /* ... */ }
doSomething(true);
----

Rule is deprecated as it's a wrong in JS:

----
"0" == false   // true
Boolean("0")   // true

\[~elena.vilchik] if it's wrong, why not just remove it? I'm not generally in favor of jerking the rug out from under users in that manner, but what you're saying is essentially that this rule _is_ a bug. As such, it should be fixed / removed.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I see your point, we deprecated it as the matter of habit. We will remove the rule in the next version (\https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarJS/issues/825), there is no point in fixing it.

Eventually we decided to keep the rule but for ``++==++`` and ``++!=++`` use different message. Even though there are some cases then simple drop of literal will break the code, code is still smelly and should be refactored.
