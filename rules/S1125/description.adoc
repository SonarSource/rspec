A boolean literal can be represented in two different ways: `{true}` or `{false}`.
They can be combined with logical operators (`{ops}`) to produce logical expressions that represent truth values.
However, comparing a boolean literal to a variable or expression that evaluates to a boolean value is unnecessary and can make the code harder to read and understand.
The more complex a boolean expression is, the harder it will be for developers to understand its meaning and expected behavior, and it will favour the introduction of new bugs.
