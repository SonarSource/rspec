=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
void doSomething() {
  ;                                                       // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");;                     // Noncompliant - double ;
  ...
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
void doSomething() {}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) ; // compliant if unique statement of a loop 
  ...
}
