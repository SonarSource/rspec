Extra semicolons (``++;++``) are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:

* It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.
* There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. ``++;;++``.
* There was a misunderstanding about where semicolons are required or useful.

----
var x = 1;; // Noncompliant

function foo() {
};  // Noncompliant
