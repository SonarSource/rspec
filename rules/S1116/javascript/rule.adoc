Extra semicolons (``++;++``) are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:

* It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.
* There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. ``++;;++``.
* There was a misunderstanding about where semicolons are required or useful.

== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,javascript]
----
var x = 1;; // Noncompliant

function foo() {
};  // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,javascript]
----
var x = 1;

function foo() {
}
----

== Exceptions

This rule does not apply when the semicolon is after a line break and before ``++(++`` or ``++[++`` as it is often used in semicolon-less style.

----
const hello = 'Hello'
const world = 'World!'
const helloWorld = hello + ' ' + world
;[...helloWorld].forEach(c => console.log(c))
----

----
const a = 1
const b = 2 * a
;(a + b).toString()
