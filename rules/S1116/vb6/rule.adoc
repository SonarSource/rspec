== Why is this an issue?

Empty statements, i.e. ``++:++``, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:

* It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.
* There was a typo which resulted in the colon being doubled, i.e. ``++::++``.

=== Noncompliant code example

Dim i, j As Integer
i = 1 :: j=2   ' Noncompliant - double :

=== Compliant solution

[source,vb6]
----
Dim i, j As Integer
i = 1 : j=2
