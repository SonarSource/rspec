Marked as irrelevant for VB.NET because the ROI for its implementation is really low. Also, there is a ``++EmptyStatement++`` syntax kind it doesn't call back on the expected cases so we would need a trivia analysis which is quite costly. As the only 2 cases, we could catch are 2 colons or a colon with nothing else on the line (which are low value cases) we decided to ignore this rule.
