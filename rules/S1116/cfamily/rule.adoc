== Why is this an issue?

include::../description.adoc[]

=== Exceptions

In the case of an empty expanded macro, the issue is not raised.

[source,cpp]
----
#define LOG(x)

void fun() {
  LOG(X);
}
----

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void doSomething() {
  ;                // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

#define A(x) x;    // Noncompliant - macro definitions should not end with a semi-colon when they are used as functions

void fun() {
  A(5);            // Noncompliant - after expansion, there are 2 consecutive semi-colons
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void doSomething() {
}

#define A(x) x

void fun() {
  A(5);
}
----
