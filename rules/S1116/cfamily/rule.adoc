== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void doSomething() {
  ;                                                       // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
void doSomething() {
}
----

== Exceptions

In the case of empty expanded macro and in the case of 2 consecutive semi-colons when one of the two is part of a macro-definition then the issue is not raised.

Example:

----
#define A(x) x;
#define LOG(x)

void fun() {
  A(5);
  LOG(X);
}
----
