==== Allow list 
When the untrusted parameters are expected to contain operators, function names
or other reflection-related values, best practices would encourage using an
allow list. This one would contain a list of accepted safe values that can be
used as part of the dynamic code.

When receiving an untrusted parameter, the application would verify its value is
contained in the configured allow list. If it is present, the parameter is
accepted. Otherwise, it is rejected and an error is raised.

Another similar approach is using a binding between identifiers and accepted
values. That way, users are only allowed to provide identifiers, where only valid
ones can be converted to a safe value.
