==== Pre-Approved values

If the application aims to execute only a known set of code instructions, a
clean way to avoid code injection is to validate the input using a list of
allowed values before executing it. If a user input does not fully match an
entry in this list, it should be rejected because it is considered unsafe.

Depending on the number of instructions you want the application to support and
their complexity, the list can be either a regular expression or an array. If
you use regular expressions, choose simple ones to avoid ReDOS attacks. For
example, you can accept only a specific set of instructions by using
`^(send|receive)\(\);$`.

*Important note*: The application must do server-side validation. Not on
client-side front-ends.
