Allowing users to execute code dynamically generally creates more problems than
it solves.

Anything that can be done via dynamic code execution can usually be done via
a language's native SDK and static code. +
Therefore, our suggestion is to avoid executing code dynamically. +
If the application requires the execution of dynamic code, you should make sure
that the code does not contain any concatenated user-controlled data. Data can be passed
safely to the dynamic code as a method parameter by the application.
