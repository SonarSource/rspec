==== Dynamic parameters 
When the untrusted values are only expected to be values used in standard
processing, it is generally possible to provide them as parameters of the dynamic
code.
In that case, care should be taken to ensure that only the *name* of the
untrusted parameter is passed to the dynamic code and not that its value is
expanded into it. After that, the dynamic code will be able to safely access the
untrusted parameter content and perform the processing.
