When building a Docker image from a Dockerfile, a context directory is used and
sent to the Docker daemon before the actual build starts. This context
directory usually contains the Dockerfile itself, along with all the files that
will be necessary for the build to succeed. This generally includes:

* the source code of applications to set up in the container.
* configuration files for other software components.
* other necessary packages or components.

The `COPY` and `ADD` directives in the Dockerfiles are then used to actually
copy content from the context directory to the image file system.

When `COPY` or `ADD` are used to recursively copy entire top-level directories
or multiple items whose names are determined at build-time, unexpected files
might get copied to the image filesystem. It could affect their 
confidentiality.
