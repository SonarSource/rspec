Oracle's ``++ROWNUM++`` is a pseudo column that numbers the rows in a result set. Unfortunately, it numbers the rows in the set _before_ ordering is applied. So combining the two in the same query won't get you the results you expect. Instead, you should move your selection and ordering into a subquery, and use ``++ROWNUM++`` only on the outer query.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
SELECT fname, lname, deptId
FROM employee
WHERE rownum <= 10
ORDER BY salary  -- Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
SELECT * 
FROM ( SELECT fname, lname, deptId
    FROM employee
    ORDER BY salary
  )
WHERE rownum <= 10
