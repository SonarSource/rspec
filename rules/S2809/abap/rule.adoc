Using "CALL TRANSACTION" statements without an authority check is security sensitive. Its access should be restricted to specific users.


This rule raises when a ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` has no explicit authorization check, i.e. when:

* the ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statement is not followed by ``++WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK++``.
* the ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statement is not following an ``++AUTHORITY-CHECK++`` statement.
* the ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statement is not following a call to the ``++AUTHORITY_CHECK_TCODE++`` function.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* the ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statement is restricted to the right users.

There is a risk if you answered no to this question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Check current user's authorization before every ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statement. Since ABAP 7.4 this should be done by appending ``++WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK++`` to ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statements. In earlier versions the ``++AUTHORITY-CHECK++`` statement or a call to the ``++AUTHORITY_CHECK_TCODE++`` function can be used.


Note that since ABAP 7.4 any ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` statement not followed by ``++WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK++`` or ``++WITHOUT AUTHORITY-CHECK++`` https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/abapcall_transaction_authority.htm[is obsolete].


== Sensitive Code Example

----
CALL TRANSACTION 'MY_DIALOG'.  " Sensitive as there is no apparent authorization check. It is also obsolete since ABAP 7.4.
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,abap]
----
AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'S_DIAGID'
                  ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '03'.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  " show an error message...
ENDIF.

CALL TRANSACTION 'MY_DIALOG'. " Ok but obsolete since ABAP 7.4.
----
or

[source,abap]
----
CALL FUNCTION 'AUTHORITY_CHECK_TCODE'
  exporting
    tcode  = up_fdta
  exceptions
    ok     = 0
    others = 4.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  " show an error message...
ENDIF.

CALL TRANSACTION up_fdta USING up_bdc mode 'E'. " Ok but obsolete since ABAP 7.4.
----
or

[source,abap]
----
CALL TRANSACTION 'MY_DIALOG' WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK. " Recommended way since ABAP 7.4.
----


== Exceptions

No issue will be raised when ``++CALL TRANSACTION++`` is followed by ``++WITHOUT AUTHORITY-CHECK++`` as it explicitly says that the TRANSACTION does not require an authorization check.
