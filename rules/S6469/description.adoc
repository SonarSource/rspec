Docker offers a feature to mount files and directories for specific `RUN`
instructions when building Docker images. This feature can be used to provide
secrets to the commands that are executed during the build without baking them
into the image. Additionally, it can be used to access SSH agents during the
build.

By using the `mode` option the permissions of the secrets or agents can be
modified. By default, access is limited to the root user.

If you are executing a command as a low-privileged user and need to access
secrets or agents, you can use the options `uid` and `gid` to provide access
without having to resort to world-readable or writable permissions that might
expose them to unintended parties.
