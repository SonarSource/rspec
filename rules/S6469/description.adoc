Docker provides a feature to mount files and directories for specific `RUN`
instructions when building Docker images. This feature can be used, among other
things, to provide secrets to the commands that are executed during the build
without baking them into the image. Additionally, it can be used to expose
SSH agents.

By using the `mode` option the permissions of the files or agents can be
modified. By default, access is limited to the root user.

If you are executing a command as a low-privileged user and need to access
secrets, you can use the options `uid` and `gid` to provide access without
having to resort to world readable or writable permissions that might expose
them to unintended parties.
