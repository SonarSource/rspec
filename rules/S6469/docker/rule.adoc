For mounts types `secret` and `ssh`, Dockerfile's `RUN` instruction supports a
`mode` option for setting permissions. If you set this mode so that any user of
the operating system can access the mount, it is vulnerable to leaks.

== Why is this an issue?

Docker offers a feature to mount files and directories for specific `RUN`
instructions when building Docker images. This feature can be used to provide
secrets to commands that are executed during the build without baking them
into the image. Additionally, it can be used to access SSH agents during the
build.

The `mode` option is an octal value that allows you to specify the permissions
for a particular file or directory. By default, on Docker, when mounting a
`secret`, it is set to `0400`.

For `ssh`, it is set by default to `0600`:

* The first digit `0` stands for special permissions (like setuid, setgid and
sticky bit) and in this case means that no special permissions are set.

* The following `6` (4+2 in octal format) means that the `owner` has read (4)
and write (2) permissions

* `00` means that the `group` and `others` have no permissions.

If the `others` bit is set to a value other than 0 at build-time, any other
process can access it when the `RUN` command is executed: the secrets are
vulnerable to supply chain attacks that aim to siphon secrets from containers.

=== What is the potential impact?

==== Unauthorized access

The unintended audience can exploit the leaked private key or equivalent to
authenticate themselves as the legitimate owner, gaining unauthorized entry to
systems, servers, or accounts that accept the key for authentication.

This unauthorized access opens the door for various malicious activities,
including data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and misuse of sensitive
information.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
# Noncompliant
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=build_secret,mode=0777 ./installer.sh
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=build_secret,mode=0700 ./installer.sh
----

=== How does this work?

In general, always follow the least privilege principle, and set the `others`
bit to `0`. By default, if `mode` is not set, permissions are safe.

In case you made this change because you need to access secrets or agents as a
low-privileged user, you can use the options `uid` and `gid` to provide access
without having to resort to world-readable or writable permissions that might
expose them to unintended parties.
