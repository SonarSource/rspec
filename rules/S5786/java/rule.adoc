JUnit5 test classes and methods should generally have package visibility.
To fix this issue, change their visibility to the default package visibility.

== Why is this an issue?

JUnit5 is more tolerant regarding the visibility of test classes and methods than JUnit4, which required everything to be `public`.
Test classes and methods can have any visibility except `private`.
It is however recommended to use the default package visibility to improve readability.

[quote, JUnit5 User Guide]
____
Test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods are not required to be `public`, but they must not be `private`.

It is generally recommended to omit the public modifier for test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods unless there is a technical reason for doing so â€“ for example, when a test class is extended by a test class in another package.
Another technical reason for making classes and methods public is to simplify testing on the module path when using the Java Module System.

=== What is the potential impact?

The code will be non-conventional and readability can be slightly affected.

=== Exceptions

This rule does not raise an issue when the visibility is set to `private`, because `private` test methods and classes are systematically ignored by JUnit5, without a proper warning.
In this case, there is also an impact on reliability and so it is handled by the rule S5810.

== How to fix it

You can simply change the visibility by removing the `public` or `protected` keywords.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyClassTest { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
  @Test
  protected void test() { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
    // ...
  }
}
----


==== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class MyClassTest {
  @Test
  void test() {
    // ...
  }
}
