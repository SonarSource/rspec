== Why is this an issue?

JUnit5 is more tolerant regarding the visibilities of Test classes than JUnit4, which required everything to be ``++public++``.


In this context, JUnit5 test classes can have any visibility but ``++private++``, however, it is recommended to use the default package visibility, which improves readability of code.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyClassTest { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
  @Test
  protected void test() { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
    // ...
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class MyClassTest {
  @Test
  void test() {
    // ...
  }
}
----


=== Exceptions

This rule does not raise an issue about ``++private++`` visibility, because ``++private++`` test methods and classes are systematically ignored by JUnit5, without a proper warning. It's not a ``++Code Smell++`` but a ``++Bug++`` handled by the rule S5810 .
