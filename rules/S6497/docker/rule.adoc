Pulling an image based on its `digest` can lead to avoidable risks that could
have been remedied with image updates.

A container image digest uniquely and immutably identifies a container image. 
A tag, on the other hand, is a mutable reference to a container image.
This tag can be updated to point to another version of the container at any point in time. +
In general, the use of image digests instead of tags is intended to keep
determinism stable within a system or infrastructure for reliability reasons.

The problem is that pulling such an image prevents the resulting container from 
being updated or patched in order to remove vulnerabilities or significant bugs. 



== Ask Yourself Whether

* You expect to receive security updates of the base image.

There is a risk if you answer yes to this question.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Containers should get the latest security updates. If there is a need for determinism, 
the solution is to find tags that are not as prone to change as `latest` or 
https://github.com/docker-library/faq#whats-the-difference-between-shared-and-simple-tags[shared tags].

To do so, favor a more precise tag that uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] and target a major version, for example.


== Sensitive Code Example

[source,docker]
----
FROM mongo@sha256:8eb8f46e22f5ccf1feb7f0831d02032b187781b178cb971cd1222556a6cee9d1

RUN echo ls
----

== Compliant Solution


Here, using mongo:6.0.4 would be better than using a digest, but would prevent security updates
made to mongo:6.0.5, for example:

[source,docker]
----
FROM mongo:6.0

RUN echo ls
----
