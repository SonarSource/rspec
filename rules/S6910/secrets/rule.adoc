=== What is the potential impact?

Postmark server tokens are used to authenticate requests to the Postmark API. When a request is made to the Postmark API, the server token is included in the header of the request. This process enables Postmark to confirm that the request originates from a trusted source and should be processed accordingly.

These tokens are sensitive because they provide full access to all features and data on a specific server in Postmark.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
