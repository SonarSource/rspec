When converting a string representation of a date and time to a `DateTime` object with the method `DateTime.Parse` you should always provide an `IFormatProvider` parameter.
If you don't provide it then the method will use the machines Culture Info and in case the given string is not following the machine's Culture then you'll have an object that does not
match the the string representation or an unexpected runtime error.
