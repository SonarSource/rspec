This rule raises an issue when a `require()` call references a file or module that doesn't exist.

== Why is this an issue?

When you use `require()` to import a module or file that doesn't exist, your application will crash at runtime with a module resolution error. This commonly happens due to:

* Typos in file paths or module names
* Missing dependencies that haven't been installed
* Incorrect relative paths
* Files that have been moved or deleted

Catching these issues during linting prevents runtime crashes and makes development more efficient. The rule validates that all static `require()` calls can be resolved to actual files or installed modules.

=== What is the potential impact?

If missing modules are not detected early, the application will fail at runtime when the problematic `require()` statement is executed. This can cause:

* Application crashes in production
* Difficult-to-debug runtime errors
* Poor user experience
* Wasted development time tracking down import issues

=== How to fix?


Fix typos in the module path and ensure the file or module exists.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// File './utlis.js' doesn't exist (typo)
const utils = require('./utlis'); // Noncompliant

// Module 'expres' doesn't exist (typo)
const express = require('expres'); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Correct the typo in the file path
const utils = require('./utils');

// Correct the typo in the module name
const express = require('express');
----
