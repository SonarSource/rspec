This is an issue when a `require()` statement references a module or file that doesn't exist, which would cause a runtime error.

== Why is this an issue?

When you use `require()` to import a module that doesn't exist, Node.js will throw a runtime error when it tries to load that module. This can happen due to typos in module names, missing dependencies, or incorrect file paths.

These errors are particularly problematic because they only surface when the code path containing the `require()` statement is executed. This means the error might not be discovered during development or testing, potentially causing issues in production.

Static analysis can catch these problems early by verifying that all required modules actually exist, either as files in your project or as installed npm packages.

=== What is the potential impact?

Runtime errors will occur when Node.js attempts to load the non-existent module. This can cause application crashes or unexpected behavior, especially if the `require()` statement is in a code path that isn't frequently executed during development.

=== How to fix?


Fix typos in module names and ensure all required files exist. For npm packages, make sure they are properly installed.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// These modules don't exist
const typoFile = require('./typo-file'); // Noncompliant
const typoModule = require('typo-module'); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
// These modules exist
const existingFile = require('./existing-file');
const existingModule = require('existing-module');
----
