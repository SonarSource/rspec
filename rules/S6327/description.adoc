Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a managed messaging service for application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. SNS topics allows publisher systems to fanout messages to a large number of subscriber systems. Amazon SNS allows to encrypt messages when they are received. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium or otherwise leak a message they are not able to access the data.
