== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to encrypt SNS topics that contain sensitive information.

To do so, create a master key and affect the SNS topic to it. Without a master
key, the SNS topic is not encrypted by default.

Then, make sure that any publishers have the ``++kms:GenerateDataKey*++`` and
``++kms:Decrypt++`` permissions for the AWS KMS key.

for more information.
