== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

It is recommended to encrypt SNS topics that contain sensitive information.

To do so, create a master key and assign the SNS topic to it. Note that this
system does not encrypt the following:

* Topic metadata (topic name and attributes)
* Message metadata (subject, message ID, timestamp, and attributes)
* Data protection policy
* Per-topic metrics

Then, make sure that any publishers have the ``++kms:GenerateDataKey*++`` and
``++kms:Decrypt++`` permissions for the AWS KMS key.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-key-management.html#sns-what-permissions-for-sse[AWS SNS Key Management Documentation]
for more information.
