Overriding the ``++Object.finalize()++`` method must be done with caution to dispose some system resources.

Calling the ``++super.finalize()++`` at the end of this method implementation is highly recommended in case parent implementations must also dispose some system resources.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
protected void finalize() {   // Noncompliant; no call to super.finalize();
  releaseSomeResources();
}

protected void finalize() {
  super.finalize();  // Noncompliant; this call should come last
  releaseSomeResources();
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
protected void finalize() {
  releaseSomeResources();
  super.finalize();    
}
----
