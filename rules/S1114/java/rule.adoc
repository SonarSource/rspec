== Why is this an issue?

Before it reclaims storage from an object that is no longer referenced, the garbage collector (GC) calls `finalize()` on the object.
It is the ideal time for the object to release resources it held during its lifetime.
However, while the GC calls `finalize` on the object it itends to reclaim, it does not call the parent implementations of finalize().

Therefore, calling `super.finalize()` at the end of the overriden method is highly recommended in order for resources acquired by parent code to be released.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
protected void finalize() {   // Noncompliant; no call to super.finalize();
  releaseSomeResources();
}
----

[source,java]
----
protected void finalize() {
  super.finalize();  // Noncompliant; this call should come last
  releaseSomeResources();
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
protected void finalize() {
  releaseSomeResources();
  super.finalize();    
}
----
