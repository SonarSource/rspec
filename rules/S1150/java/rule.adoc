== Why is this an issue?

As documented in `Enumeration` 's Javadoc, you should favor the `Iterator` interface over `Enumeration`.
`Iterator` offers a similar contract to `Enumeration` with the addition of a method for removal and shorter method names.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass implements Enumeration {  // Noncompliant
  /* ... */
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass implements Iterator {     // Compliant
  /* ... */
}
----
