\[~nicolas.harraudeau] - we need to decide the scope of "SQL keywords". For .NET, we could take the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/reserved-keywords-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017[SQL Server and Azure SQL Data Warehouse reserved keywords] - is it too much?


As we've discussed, there is a need to take into consideration SQL keywords to identify a SQL statement string. I guess we need to be case sensitive when doing the keyword matching, right?


Also, we can have:


----
string select = "SELECT p.fname," + // No space, but ok
        "p.lname," +  // No space, but ok
        "p.street1," +  // No space, but ok
        "p.street2" +
        " FROM person p" +
        " WHERE p.id = 1";
----

Alternatively, we can just make an exception for `,` and consider the comma like a space ?

Out of scope: concatenation of hardcoded strings and variables


So we will raise on:

----
"SELECT x" + // Noncompliant
"FROM y" + // Noncompliant
"WHERE z =" + var;
----
But we won't raise on

----
"SELECT x" + // compliant
variable +
"WHERE z =" + var;

During a .NET LaYC sprint, I removed CFamily, Java, PHP, Python, Swift and VB.NET, since they had dummy specifications with no implementations and no implementation tickets.
