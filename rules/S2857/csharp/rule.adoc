== Why is this an issue?

When concatenating strings, it is very easy to forget a whitespace. 

In some scenarios this might cause runtime errors, one of which is creating an SQL query via concatenation.

This rule raises an issue when the spacing around SQL keywords appears to be missing, making the concatenated string invalid SQL syntax. 

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
string select = "SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, p.PhoneNumber" +
        "FROM Person as p" +  // Noncompliant; concatenation results to: p.zipFROM
        "WHERE p.Id = @Id";  // Noncompliant; concatenation results to: pWHERE
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
string select = "SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, p.PhoneNumber" +
        " FROM Person as p" +
        " WHERE p.Id = @Id";
