=== What is the potential impact?

A SonarQube token is a unique key that serves as an authentication mechanism for
accessing the SonarQube platform's APIs. It is used to securely authenticate
and authorize external tools or services to interact with SonarQube.

Tokens are typically generated for specific users or applications and can be
configured with different levels of access permissions. By using a token,
external tools or services can perform actions such as analyzing code,
retrieving analysis results, creating projects, or managing quality profiles
within SonarQube.

If a SonarQube token leaks to an unintended audience, it can pose a security
risk to the SonarQube instance and the associated projects. Attackers may use
the leaked token to gain unauthorized access to the SonarQube instance. They can
potentially view sensitive information, modify project settings, or perform
other dangerous actions.

Additionally, attackers with access to a token can modify code analysis results.
This can lead to false positives or negatives in the analysis, compromising the
accuracy and reliability of the platform.

== How to fix it

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/fix/recent_use.adoc[]

The SonarQube audit log can be downloaded from the product web interface and can
be used to audit the malicious use of the compromised key. This feature is
available starting with SonarQube Enterprise Edition.
