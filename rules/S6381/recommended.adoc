== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Limit the assignment of Owner roles to less than 3 people or service principals.
* Apply the least privilege principle by choosing a role with a limited set of permissions.
* If no built-in role meets your needs, create a custom role with as few permissions as possible.
