Azure Resource Manager offers built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups or service principals.
Some of these roles should be assigned carefully as they grant sensitive permissions like the ability to control all the resources of a subscription.

An Azure account that fails to limit the use of such roles has a higher risk of being breached by a compromised owner.

This rule raise an issue when one of the following roles is assigned:

- Contributor
- Owner
- User Access Administrator
