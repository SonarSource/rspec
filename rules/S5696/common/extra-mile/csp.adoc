==== Content Security Policy

With a defense-in-depth security approach, a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP[Content Security Policy] (CSP) can be added through the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header, or using a `<meta>` element. The CSP aims to mitigate XSS attacks by instructing client browsers not to load data that does not meet the application's security requirements.

Server administrators can define an allowlist of domains that contain valid scripts, which will prevent malicious scripts (not stored on one of these domains) from being executed. If script execution is not needed on a certain webpage, it can also be blocked altogether.
