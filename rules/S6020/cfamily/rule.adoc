== Why is this an issue?

When they were first introduced in the language, type traits, defined in header ``++<type_traits>,++`` required to use nested types (with ``++::type++``) or nested values (with ``++::value++``) to access the result of the trait. Since then, the language introduced templated alias declaration and variable templates that allow to define traits in a more direct and readable way.


Even if the old variant still exists, the new one, which uses ``++_t++`` ({cpp}14) and ``++_v++`` ({cpp}17) suffixes as discriminant, should be preferred.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
void f(T t) {
  static_assert (std::is_arithmetic<T>::value); // Noncompliant
  using rawType = std::remove_cv<T>::type; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
void f(T t) {
  static_assert (std::is_arithmetic_v<T>); // Compliant, C++17
  using rawType = std::remove_cv_t<T>; // Compliant, C++14
}
----
