== Why is this an issue?

Repeating an exception class in a single ``++catch++`` clause will not fail but it is not what the developer intended. Either the class is not the one which should be caught, or this is dead code.


Having a subclass and a parent class in the same ``++catch++`` clause is also useless. It is enough to keep only the parent class.


This rule raises an issue when an exception class is duplicated in a ``++catch++`` clause, or when an exception class has a parent class in the same ``++catch++`` clause.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
try {
    throw new CustomException();
} catch(CustomException | Exception $e) { // Noncompliant. CustomException inherits from Exception
    echo $e->message();
}

try {
    throw new CustomException();
} catch(Exception | Exception $e) { // Noncompliant.
    echo $e->message();
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
try {
    throw new CustomException();
} catch(Exception $e) {
    echo $e->message();
}

try {
    throw new CustomException();
} catch(CustomException $e) {
    echo $e->getCustomMessage();
} catch(Exception $e) {
    echo $e->message();
}
