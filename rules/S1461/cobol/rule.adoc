An unused section is never called explicitly with help of the GO TO or PERFORM statements.

There can be only two reasons for having such a section:

* It is really unused and should be removed
* It is only used as a kind of comment to clearly delimit a block of code, which is a bad practice

The remediation action should be:

* Replace the section by a comment line
* Refactor the code to make an explicit call to this section instead of letting the execution flow going through it implicitly
