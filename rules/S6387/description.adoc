Azure RBAC roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. A role assignment grants permissions on a predefined set of resources called "scope".
A role assigned with a Subscription scope grant access to all resources of this Subscription. 
A role assigned with a Management Group scope grant access to all resources of all the Subscriptions in this Management Group.

Subscriptions and Managements Group are the widest scopes a role can be assigned to. Narrowing the assigned scope to a management group or a resource, limits the resources that are at risk if the identity being assigned (user, group, or service principal) is ever compromised.
