The DML events clause of a trigger is not meant to be used with multiple ``++OF++`` conditions. When it is, only the last one will actually be taken into account, without any error message being produced. This can lead to counter-intuitive code.


Only the ``++UPDATE++`` event should have an ``++OF++`` condition, and there should be at most one occurence of it.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER myTrigger
  BEFORE UPDATE OF firstName OR UPDATE OF lastName -- Noncompliant - will *only* be triggered on updates of lastName!
  ON myTable
  FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
----

== Compliant Solution

----
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER myTrigger
  BEFORE UPDATE OF firstName, lastName             -- Compliant - triggered on updates of firstName or/and lastName
  ON myTable
  FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
