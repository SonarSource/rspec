== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Avoid opening `file://` URLs from external sources in WebView components. If your application accepts arbitrary URLs
from external sources, do not enable this functionality. Instead, utilize `androidx.webkit.WebViewAssetLoader` to access
files, including assets and resources, via `http(s)://` schemes.

For enhanced security, ensure that the options to load `file://` URLs are explicitly set to false.
