MSVC-specific extensions should not be used

== Why is this an issue?

Proprietary compiler extensions can be handy, but they commit you to always using that compiler. This rule raises an issue when MSVC-specific extensions are used. Other compilers will reject such code, making it non-portable. Keeping code standard-conforming ensures consistency across different compilers and platforms.

== How to fix it

Replace MSVC-specific extensions with standard-conforming alternatives.
