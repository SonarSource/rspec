MSVC-specific extensions should not be used

== Why is this an issue?

Proprietary compiler extensions can be handy, but they commit you to always using that compiler. This rule raises an issue when MSVC-specific extensions are used. Other compilers will reject such code, making it non-portable. Keeping code standard-conforming ensures consistency across different compilers and platforms.

== How to fix it

Replace MSVC-specific extensions with standard-conforming alternatives.

=== The 'abstract' keyword

The ``++abstract++`` keyword is a Microsoft extension for declaring abstract classes. This keyword is not part of the {cpp} standard and will be rejected by other compilers.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class AbstractClass abstract {}; // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class AbstractClass {
public:
  virtual ~AbstractClass() = default;
  virtual void method() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
----

=== Using members from dependent bases

MSVC allows unqualified lookup of members from dependent base classes in class templates, which is not permitted by the {cpp} standard. The standard requires two-phase lookup: dependent names must be explicitly qualified (using ``++this->++`` or the base class name) because they cannot be resolved until template instantiation.

==== Noncompliant code example
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
template <typename T> struct Base { void baseMethod(); };

template <typename T> struct Derived : Base<T> {
  void method() {
    baseMethod(); // Noncompliant
  }
};
----

==== Compliant solution
[source,cpp,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
template <typename T> struct Base { void baseMethod(); };

template <typename T> struct Derived : Base<T> {
  void method() {
    this->baseMethod(); // Or Base<T>::baseMethod();
  }
};
----
