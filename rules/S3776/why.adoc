https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf[Cognitive Complexity] is a measure of how hard the control flow of a code is to understand. Code with high cognitive complexity is hard to read, understand, test, and modify. 

As a rule of thumb, high cognitive complexity is a sign that the code should be refactored into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces.

The linked pdf provides information on how this cognitive complexity is computed.
