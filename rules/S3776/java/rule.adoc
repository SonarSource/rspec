== Why is this an issue?

Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a method is to understand. Methods with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain.

=== Exceptions

``++equals++`` and ``++hashCode++`` methods are ignored because they might be automatically generated and might end up being difficult to understand, especially in presence of many fields.
