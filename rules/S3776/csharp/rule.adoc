== Why is this an issue?

https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf[Cognitive Complexity] Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a method is to understand.

That is different from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory[Computational Complexity], which focuses on the resources (time and space) required for a method to run.

Two methods can have the same computational complexity but different cognitive complexity, as in the example below:

Methods with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain and should be refactored to have lower complexity.
