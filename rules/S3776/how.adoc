Reducing cognitive complexity can be challenging. +
Here are a few suggestions:

* **Extract complex conditions in a new function.** +
Mixed operators in condition will increase complexity.
Extracting the condition in a new function with an appropriate name will reduce cognitive load.
* **Break down large functions.** +
Large functions can be hard to understand and maintain.
If a function is doing too many things, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.
Each function should have a single responsibility.
* **Avoid deep nesting by returning early.** +
To avoid the nesting of conditions, process exceptional cases first and return early.
