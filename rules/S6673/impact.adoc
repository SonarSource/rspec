=== What is the potential impact?

Logging providers use placeholder names to create key/value pairs in the log entry. The key corresponds to the placeholder and the value is the argument passed in the log call.

If the positions of the placeholder and the argument do not match, the value is associated with the wrong key. This corrupts the logs entry and makes log analytics unreliable.
