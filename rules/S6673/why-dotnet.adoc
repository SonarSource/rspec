== Why is this an issue?

The placeholders of a https://messagetemplates.org[message template] are defined by their name and their position. Log methods specify the values for the placeholder at runtime by passing them in a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/params[params array]:

include::{language}/example_1_compliant.adoc[]

This rule raises an issue if the position of an argument does not match the position of the corresponding placeholder:

include::{language}/example_1_noncompliant.adoc[]

include::impact.adoc[]
