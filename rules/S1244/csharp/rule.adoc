== Why is this an issue?

Floating point math is imprecise because of the challenges of storing such values in a binary representation. Even worse, floating point math is not associative; push a ``++float++`` or a ``++double++`` through a series of simple mathematical operations and the answer will be different based on the order of those operation because of the rounding that takes place at each step.


Even simple floating point assignments are not simple:

----
float f = 0.100000001f; // 0.1
double d = 0.10000000000000001; // 0.1
----

(Results will vary based on compiler and compiler settings)


Therefore, the use of the equality (``++==++``) and inequality (``++!=++``) operators on ``++float++`` or ``++double++`` values is almost always an error.


This rule checks for the use of direct and indirect equality/inequality tests on floats and doubles.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
float myNumber = 3.146f;
if ( myNumber == 3.146f ) //Noncompliant. Because of floating point imprecision, this will be false
{
  // ...
}

if (myNumber <= 3.146f && mNumber >= 3.146f) // Noncompliant indirect equality test
{
  // ...
}

if (myNumber < 4 || myNumber > 4) // Noncompliant indirect inequality test
{
  // ...
}

Do not check floating point [in]equality with exact values, use [a range | `FloatingPointTypeName.IsXXX()` | `IsXXX()`] instead.
