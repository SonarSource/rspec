ORACLE 11g introduced the ``++SIMPLE_INTEGER++`` data type, which is a sub-type of ``++PLS_INTEGER++``, and covers the same range. There are three main differences between the two types:

* ``++SIMPLE_INTEGER++`` is always ``++NOT NULL++``. So when the value of the declared variable is never going to be null, you can declare it as ``++SIMPLE_INTEGER++``.
* You will never face a numeric overflow using ``++SIMPLE_INTEGER++`` because this data type wraps around without giving any error.
* The ``++SIMPLE_INTEGER++`` data type gives a major performance boost over ``++PLS_INTEGER++`` when the code is compiled in "NATIVE" mode, because arithmetic operations on ``++SIMPLE_INTEGER++`` type are performed directly at the hardware level.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
DECLARE
  v1 PLS_INTEGER; -- Noncompliant
  v2 VARCHAR2(10);
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/

== Compliant Solution

----
DECLARE
  v1 SIMPLE_INTEGER := 42;
  v2 VARCHAR2(10);
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
