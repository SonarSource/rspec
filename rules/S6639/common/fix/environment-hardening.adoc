==== Harden the execution environment configuration

As a defense in depth measure, it is advised to harden the execution environment
configuration regarding memory usage. This can effectively reduce the scope of a
successful Denial of Service attack and prevent a complete outage, potentially
ranging over multiple applications.

When running the application in a contained environment, like a Docker
container, it is usually possible to limit the amount of memory provided to the
contained environment. In that case, memory exhaustion will only impact the
application hosting container and not the host system.

When running the application directly on a physical or heavy virtualized server,
memory limits can sometimes be set on the application's associated service
account. For example, the `ulimit` mechanism of Unix based operating systems can
be used for that purpose. With such a limit set up, memory exhaustion only
impacts the applications and processes owned by the related service
account.
