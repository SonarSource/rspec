== Why is this an issue?

The role of `assert` is to check at runtime that a condition is true and if it doesn't, emit a diagnostic.

This rule raises an issue if an `assert`` cannot be false because its value is hard-coded as true.

The following asserts will never emit a diagnostic:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
assert(true); // Noncompliant
assert(1);    // Noncompliant
assert("Message"); // Noncompliant: the address of this string literal is never nullptr
----

They are usually either typos or dead code and should be fixed or removed:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
assert(a); // checks that a is true
assert(false); // interrupts execution
assert(!"Message") // interrupts execution with a message
----
