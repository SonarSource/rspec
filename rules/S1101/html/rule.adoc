When links with different targets are given identical link text, this can produce confusion for users of assistive technologies, some of which provide users the ability to view a list of all links on the page.

When this list of links is presented to the user they may be left not knowing the links go to different destinations.

Even if they do realize the links go to different destinations, they may be left not knowing which link to follow to go to the destination they desire.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
<a href="a.html">qux</a>
<a href="b.html">qux</a>          <!-- Noncompliant; same text, different targets -->

<a href="c.html">foo</a>
<a href="d.html">foo</a>          <!-- Noncompliant; same text, different targets -->
----


== Compliant Solution

----
<a href="a.html">qux</a>
<a href="b.html">qaz</a>          <!-- Compliant; different text, different targets -->

<a href="c.html">foo</a>
<a href="c.html">foo</a>          <!-- Compliant; same text, same targets -->
