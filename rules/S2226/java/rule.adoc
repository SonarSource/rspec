== Why is this an issue?

The `processHttpRequest` method and methods called from it are executed by multiple threads within the same servlet instance, and state changes to the instance caused by these methods are, therefore, not threadsafe.

This is due to the servlet container creating only one instance of each servlet (`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`) and attaching a dedicated thread to each incoming HTTP request.
The same problem exists for `org.apache.struts.action.Action` but with different methods.

To prevent unexpected behavior, avoiding mutable states in servlets is recommended.
Mutable instance fields should either be refactored into local variables or made immutable by declaring them `final`.

=== Exceptions

* Fields annotated with ``++@javax.inject.Inject++``, ``++@javax.ejb.EJB++``, ``++@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired++``, ``++@javax.annotation.Resource++``
* Fields initialized in ``++init()++`` or ``++init(ServletConfig config)++`` methods

== How to fix it

=== Noncompliant code example

If the field is not changed, declare it `final`.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
  String apiVersion = "0.9.1"; // Noncompliant, field changes are not thread-safe
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
  final String apiVersion = "0.9.1"; // Compliant, field cannot be changed
}
----

=== Noncompliant code example

If a field is changed within instance methods, refactor it into a local variable.
That variable can be passed as an argument to other functions if needed.

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

  String userName; // Noncompliant, field changes are not thread-safe

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    userName = req.getParameter("userName"); // Different threads may write concurrently to userName
    resp.getOutputStream().print(getGreeting());
  }

  public String getGreeting() { // Unpredictable value in field userName
    return "Hello "+userName+"!";
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    String userName = req.getParameter("userName"); // Compliant, local variable instead instance field
    resp.getOutputStream().print(getGreeting(userName));
  }

  public String getGreeting(String userName) { // Compliant, method argument instead instance field
    return "Hello "+userName+"!";
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

If you still prefer instance state over local variables, consider using `ThreadLocal` fields.
These fields provide a separate instance of their value for each thread.

[source,java,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

  final ThreadLocal<String> userName = new ThreadLocal<>(); // Compliant, field itself does not change

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    userName.set(req.getParameter("userName")); // Compliant, own value provided for every thread
    resp.getOutputStream().print(getGreeting());
  }

  public String getGreeting() {
    return "Hello "+userName.get()+"!"; // Compliant, own value provided for every thread
  }
}
----

=== Noncompliant code example

If you have a use case that requires a shared instance state between threads, declare the corresponding fields as `static` to indicate your intention and awareness that there is only one instance.
However, the `static` modifier alone does not ensure thread safety.
Make sure also to take countermeasures against possible race conditions.

[source,java,diff-id=3,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

  public long timestampLastRequest; // Noncompliant, field changes are not thread-safe

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    timestampLastRequest = System.currentTimeMillis();
    resp.getOutputStream().print(timestampLastRequest); // Race condition
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,java,diff-id=3,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

  public static long timestampLastRequest; // Compliant, sharing state is our intention

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    long timestamp;
    synchronized (this) {
      timestamp = timestampLastRequest; // No race condition, synchronized get & set
      timestampLastRequest = System.currentTimeMillis();
    }
    resp.getOutputStream().print(timestamp);
  }
}

\[~freddy.mallet] the original requester was specific that the rule shouldn't be limited to just ``++Servlet++`` classes, but I'm happy to go along if you feel that would make a better rule. 


BTW, he's also asking for an ignoreClasses parameter.

The issue is not aligned with servlet semantics. Specifically: 


A servlet can be legitimately initialized from ServletContext using ``++init(ServletContext)++`` method. This makes it impossible to qualify servlet fields as final. 


Another suggestion to make servlet fields static introduces rather misleading semantics and contradicts the referenced document: \https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MSC11-J.+Do+not+let+session+information+leak+within+a+servlet
