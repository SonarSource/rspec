== Why is this an issue?

Contrary to what you might believe, using the addition operator does not append an integral constant to a string. Adding a ``++char++`` or an integral to a string pointer does not append it to the string. What it does instead is incrementing the string pointer by a value defined by this ``++char++`` or integral.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
int a;
std::string str1 = "foo" + a; // Noncompliant

char[] b = "foo";
char* str2 = b + 'b'; // Noncompliant{code}

----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
int a;
std::string str1 = "foo" + std::to_string(a); // Compliant

std::string s = "foo";
std::string str2 = s + 'b'; // Compliant{code}
