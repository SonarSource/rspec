== Why is this an issue?

It is possible in an ``++IDisposable++`` to call ``++Dispose++`` on class members from any method, but the contract of ``++Dispose++`` is that it will clean up all unmanaged resources. Move disposing of members to some other method, and you risk resource leaks.


This rule also applies for disposable ref structs.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
  private FileStream fs;  
  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }
  public void CloseResource()
  {
    this.fs.Close();
  }

  public void CleanUp() 
  {
    this.fs.Dispose(); // Noncompliant; Dispose not called in class' Dispose method
  }

  public void Dispose() 
  {
    // method added to satisfy demands of interface
  }
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
  private FileStream fs;
  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }
  public void CloseResource()
  {
    this.fs.Close();
  }

  public void Dispose() 
  {
    this.fs.Dispose();
  }
}
