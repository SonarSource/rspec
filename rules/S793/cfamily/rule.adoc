The ``++#pragma++`` directive is implementation-defined, hence it is important both to demonstrate that all uses are correct, and to minimize, localize and encapsulate any use of pragmas within dedicated functions whenever possible.


The meaning of each pragma shall be documented.

There shall be sufficient supporting description to demonstrate that the behavior of the pragma and its implications for the application, have been fully understood.


This rule flags all instances of ``++#pragma++`` directives, and leaves it to the user to determine whether they have been properly documented.
