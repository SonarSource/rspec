== Why is this an issue?

In a ``++PERFORM prodecure1 THRU procedure2++`` statement, the two procedures should share a naming convention because they are strongly related and there should be a way to quickly see this relationship while reading the source code. Otherwise, the source code might quickly become very complex to maintain. To this end, procedure2 should contain the name of procedure1 and either a prefix or a suffix. For instance: ``++PERFORM my-paragraph THRU end-my-paragraph++``.
