== Why is this an issue?

An unused data item block is dead code. Such data item blocks should be removed to increase the maintainability of the program.

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. foo.

DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
  01 PERSON.        *> Compliant as sub data item FIRST_NAME is used
    02 FIRST_NAME PIC X(21).
    02 LAST_NAME PIC X(21).

  01 ADDR.   *> Noncompliant as no data item in this block is used
    02 STREET PIC X(50).  
    02 TOWN PIC X(50).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.

MOVE "John" TO FIRST_NAME.
