The purpose of changing the current working directory is to modify the base path when the process performs relative path resolutions. When the working directory cannot be changed, the process keeps the directory previously defined as the active working directory. Thus, verifying the success of chdir() type of functions is important to prevent unintended relative paths and unauthorized access.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* The success of changing the working directory is relevant for the application.
* Changing the working directory is required by chroot to make the new root effective.
* Subsequent disk operations are using relative paths.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

After changing the current working directory verify the success of the operation and handle errors.


== Sensitive Code Example

The ``++chdir++`` operation could fail and the process still has access to unauthorized resources. The return code should be verified:

----
const char* any_dir = "/any/";
chdir(any_dir); // Sensitive: missing check of the return value

int fd = open(any_dir, O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY);
fchdir(fd); // Sensitive: missing check of the return value
----


== Compliant Solution

Verify the return code of ``++chdir++`` and handle errors:

[source,cpp]
----
const char* root_dir = "/jail/";
if (chdir(root_dir) == -1) {
  exit(-1);
} // Compliant

int fd = open(any_dir, O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY);
if(fchdir(fd) == -1) {
  exit(-1);
} // Compliant
----

Make sure that changing the current working directory without verifying the success if safe here.
