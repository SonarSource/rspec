=== What is the potential impact?

In the case of Slack, an Incoming Webhook URL allows access to a channel. The
consequences of leaking this secret depend on the channel that can be
accessed with the leaked Incoming Webhook URL.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Identity spoofing

Using the webhook URL, attackers can impersonate you or your bot, send messages
on your behalf or perform other actions that could disrupt the integrity of
your channel.

==== Phishing

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to offer users links to a malicious
domain controlled by the attacker. From here, an attacker can intercept the
user's credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), and take over the
user's account on the trusted site.

==== Malware distribution

In addition, malware can be distributed to Slack users.
It is important to note that this leak can lead to full system
compromises in the worst-case scenario.
