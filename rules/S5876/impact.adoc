=== What is the potential impact?

Session fixation attacks pose a significant security risk to web applications and their users. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user sessions, potentially leading to various malicious activities. Some of the most relevant scenarios are the following:

==== Impersonation

Once an attacker successfully fixes a session identifier, they can impersonate the victim and gain access to their account without providing valid credentials. This can result in unauthorized actions, such as modifying personal information, making unauthorized transactions, or even performing malicious activities on behalf of the victim. An attacker can also manipulate the victim into performing actions they wouldn't normally do, such as revealing sensitive information or conducting financial transactions on the attacker's behalf.

==== Data Breach

If an attacker gains access to a user's session, they may also gain access to sensitive data associated with that session. This can include personal information, financial details, or any other confidential data that the user has access to within the application. The compromised data can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious purposes.

==== Privilege Escalation

In some cases, session fixation attacks can be used to escalate privileges within a web application. By fixing a session identifier with higher privileges, an attacker can bypass access controls and gain administrative or privileged access to the application. This can lead to unauthorized modifications, data manipulation, or even complete compromise of the application and its underlying systems.
