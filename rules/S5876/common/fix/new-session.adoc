The protection works by ensuring that the session identifier, which is used to identify and track a user's session, is changed or regenerated during the authentication process.

Here's how session fixation protection typically works:

1. When a user visits a website or logs in, a session is created for them. This session is assigned a unique session identifier, which is stored in a cookie or passed through URL parameters.

2. In a session fixation attack, an attacker tricks a user into using a predetermined session identifier controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's session.

3. To protect against session fixation attacks, session fixation protection mechanisms come into play during the authentication process. When a user successfully authenticates, this mechanism generates a new session identifier for the user's session.

4. The old session identifier, which may have been manipulated by the attacker, is invalidated and no longer associated with the user's session. This ensures that any attempts by the attacker to use the fixed session identifier are rendered ineffective.

5. The user is then assigned the new session identifier, which is used for subsequent requests and session tracking. This new session identifier is typically stored in a new session cookie or passed through URL parameters.

By regenerating the session identifier upon authentication, session fixation protection helps ensure that the user's session is tied to a new, secure identifier that the attacker cannot predict or control. This mitigates the risk of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the user's session and helps maintain the integrity and security of the application's session management process.
