Session fixation attacks are a type of vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to a user's session. This attack takes advantage of the way web applications manage session identifiers.

To carry out a session fixation attack, the attacker typically tricks the victim into using a predetermined session identifier. This can be achieved through various means, such as sending a specially crafted link or manipulating the victim's browser settings. Once the victim logs in using the provided session identifier, the attacker can then use the same identifier to gain access to the victim's session.
