== Why is this an issue?

=== What is the potential impact?

Leaking this secret can allow an attacker to exploit the Chief Tools API, and
therefore any of the Chief apps.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.

==== Domain hijacking
If the leaked secret gives an attacker a Cert Chief entitlement, the attacker
can use it to stay informed about the certificates of your domain to
automatically renew and take ownership of the next certificate. This can lead to
a domain hijacking attack.

==== Supply chain attacks
If the leaked secret gives an attacker a Deploy Chief entitlement, then there
may exist grave consequences beyond the compromise of source code. The attacker
may inject malware, backdoors, or other harmful code into these private
repositories.

This can cause further security breaches inside the organization, but will also
affect clients if the malicious code gets added to any products. Distributing
code that (unintentionally) contains backdoors or malware can lead to widespread
security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.

==== Phishing and spam
I the leaked secret gives an attacker a Tny entitlement, an attacker can use
this API token to hide a malicious domain and use it in spam/phishing campaigns.

Spam can cause users to be exposed to the following:

* Unsolicited, inappropriate content
* Fraudulent attempts to trick users into sending information or money
* Abusive or hateful statements
* False advertising or fraudulent claims
