== Why is this an issue?

When a promise only needs to "resolve" or "reject", it's more efficient and readable to use the methods specially created for such use cases: ``++Promise.resolve()++`` and ``++Promise.reject()++``.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
let fulfilledPromise = new Promise(resolve => resolve(42));   // Noncompliant: Creating a promise just for resolving
let rejectedPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { // Noncompliant: Creating a promise just for rejecting
  reject('fail');
});
----

Instead of explicitly creating new promises, use ``++Promise.resolve()++`` and ``++Promise.reject()++`` to create promises in a more concise and readable way.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
let fulfilledPromise = Promise.resolve(42);
let rejectedPromise = Promise.reject('fail');
