== Why is this an issue?

An iframe, or inline frame, is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a website. The iframe HTML element is often used to insert content from another source, such as an advertisement, into a web page.

In the context of web accessibility, ``++<iframe>++``'s should have a ``++title++`` attribute. This is because screen readers for the visually impaired use this title to help users understand the content of the iframe.

Without a title, it can be difficult for these users to understand the context or purpose of the iframe's content.
