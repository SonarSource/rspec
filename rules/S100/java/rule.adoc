== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a method name does not match a provided regular expression.

For example, with the default provided regular expression ``++^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$++``, the method:

[source,java]
----
public int DoSomething(){...} // Noncompliant
----

should be renamed to

[source,java]
----
public int doSomething(){...}
----

=== Exceptions

Overriding methods are excluded.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public int Do_Something(){...} // Compliant by exception
----
