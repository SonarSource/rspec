== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a method or a property name is not PascalCased.

For example, the method

[source,csharp]
----
public int doSomething() {...} // Noncompliant
----

should be renamed to

[source,csharp]
----
public int DoSomething() {...}
----

=== Exceptions

* The rule ignores members in types marked with `ComImportAttribute` or `InterfaceTypeAttribute`.
* The rule ignores `extern` methods.
* To reduce noise, two consecutive upper-case characters are allowed unless they form the full name. So, `MyXMethod` is compliant, but `XM` is not.
* The camel casing is not enforced when a name contains the ``++'_'++`` character.

[source,csharp]
----
void My_method_(){...} // Noncompliant, leading and trailing underscores are reported

void My_method(){...} // Compliant by exception
----
