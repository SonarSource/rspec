== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a subroutine name does not match a provided regular expression.

For example, with the default provided regular expression ``++^SR[a-zA-Z0-9]*$++``, the following subroutines:

[source,rpg]
----
C     XXXXX         BEGSR
...
C                   ENDSR
----

[source,rpg]
----
 /free
   begsr yyyy;
   endsr;
 /end-free{code}
----

should be renamed to

[source,rpg]
----
C     SR102         BEGSR
...
C                   ENDSR
----

[source,rpg]
----
 /free
   begsr SR103;
   endsr;
 /end-free
----
