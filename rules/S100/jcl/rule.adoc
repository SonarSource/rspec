== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a procedure name does not match a provided regular expression.

For example, with the default provided regular expression ``++^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*$++``, the procedure:

[source,jcl]
----
//* Noncompliant
//$PROC1 PROC
----

should be renamed to

[source,jcl]
----
//PROC1 PROC
----
