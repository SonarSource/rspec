== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a method name does not match a provided regular expression.

For example, with the default provided regular expression ``++^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$++``, the method:

[source,python]
----
class MyClass:
    def MyMethod(a,b): # Noncompliant
        ...
----

should be renamed to

[source,python]
----
class MyClass:
    def my_method(a,b):
        ...
----
