@Ann:

* The reference to the relating MISRAC-{cpp} rule 8-4-2 and not 8-4-1 if my understanding is correct.
* In the "Compliant Solution", "//noncompliant..." comments should be removed
* I would not mention API08-C, as this rule refer to something almost at the opposite -> parameters should not be named

Could you run through it one more time? There were minor modifications in the sample code.

\[~tamas.vajk] I'm not sure why you swapped the parameter order. I feel like reversing the names is a better illustration of the confusion that could result in param names that don't match...?

I've changed the sample code.

* java
* javascript
