== Why is this an issue?

Parameters are part of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature#Method_signature[method signature] and its identity. 

Implementing a method from an interface or a base class and changing one of its parameters' names will confuse and impact its readability.

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Interface IBankAccount
    Sub AddMoney(money As Integer)
End Interface

Class BankAccount
    Implements IBankAccount

    Private Sub AddMoney(amount As Integer) ' Noncompliant: parameter's name differs from base
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
----

To avoid any ambiguity in the code, parameters' names should match the initial declaration, whether its initial declaration is from an interface or a base class.

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Interface IBankAccount
    Sub AddMoney(money As Integer)
End Interface

Class BankAccount
    Implements IBankAccount

    Private Sub AddMoney(money As Integer) ' Compliant: parameter's name match base name
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
