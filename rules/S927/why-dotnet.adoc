== Why is this an issue?

Parameters are part of the {methodSignatureLine}[method signature] and its identity. 

Implementing a method from an interface, a base class, or a partial method and changing one of its parameters' names will confuse and impact the method's readability.

include::{noncompliantCode}[]

To avoid any ambiguity in the code, a parameter's name should match the initial declaration, whether its initial declaration is from an interface, a base class, or a partial method.

include::{compliantCode}[]

=== Exceptions
The rule is ignored if both the parameter defined in the initial decalaration is a generic type and the implementing member's declaration is a non-generic type. 

This allows the implementing member to be more specific and provide more information.
