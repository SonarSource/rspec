== Why is this an issue?

Parameters are part of the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods#method-signatures[method signature] and its identity. 

Implementing a method from an interface, a base class, or a partial method and changing one of its parameters' names will confuse and impact its readability.

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
interface IBankAccount
{
  void AddMoney(int money);
}

class BankAccount : IBankAccount
{
  void AddMoney(int amount) // Noncompliant: parameter's name differs from base
  {
    // ...
  }
}
----

To avoid any ambiguity in the code, parameters' names should match the initial declaration, whether its initial declaration is from an interface, a base class, or a partial method.

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
interface IBankAccount
{
  void AddMoney(int money);
}

class BankAccount : IBankAccount
{
  void AddMoney(int money) // Compliant: parameter's name match base name
  {
    // ...
  }
}

Could you run through it one more time? There were minor modifications in the sample code.

\[~tamas.vajk] I'm not sure why you swapped the parameter order. I feel like reversing the names is a better illustration of the confusion that could result in param names that don't match...?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I changed it because `yk` was not used in the method body, so it already just looked like a typo.


I've changed the sample code.
