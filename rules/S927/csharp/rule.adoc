== Why is this an issue?

The name of a parameter in an externally visible. This rule raises an issue when method override does not match the name of the parameter in the base declaration of the method, or the name of the parameter in the interface declaration of the method or the name of any other ``++partial++`` definition.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
partial class Point
{
  partial void MoveVertically(int z);
}

partial class Point
{
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  int z = 0;

  partial void MoveVertically(int y)  // Noncompliant
  {
    this.y = y;
  }
}

interface IFoo
{
  void Bar(int i);
}

class Foo : IFoo
{
  void Bar(int z) // Noncompliant, parameter name should be i
  {
  }
}
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
partial class Point
{
  partial void MoveVertically(int z);
}

partial class Point
{
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  int z = 0;

  partial void MoveVertically(int z)
  {
    this.z = z;
  }
}

interface IFoo
{
  void Bar(int i);
}

class Foo : IFoo
{
  void Bar(int i) 
  {
  }
}

Could you run through it one more time? There were minor modifications in the sample code.

\[~tamas.vajk] I'm not sure why you swapped the parameter order. I feel like reversing the names is a better illustration of the confusion that could result in param names that don't match...?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I changed it because ``++yk++`` was not used in the method body, so it already just looked like a typo.


I've changed the sample code.
