== Why is this an issue?

Parameters are part of the method signature and its identity.

Overriding a method and changing one of its parameters' names will confuse and impact the method's readability. In {doc}[dart doc] the consequences might be even worse. If an overriding method doesn't provide ots own documentation comment, it will inherit a comment from an overridden method. If the inherited comment contains a link to the parameter, which was renamed, linking will fail.

To avoid any ambiguity in the code, a parameter's name should match the initial declaration, whether its initial declaration is from an interface, a base class, or a partial method.
