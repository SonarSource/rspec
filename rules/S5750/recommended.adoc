== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Implement https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control[Cache-Control] HTTP header with a cacheability directive set to `+private+` in order to instruct shared caches (CDNs, proxies) to avoid caching. If the risk is too important, it is recommended to not cache anything at the web browser level too, with a cacheability directive set to `+no-store+`.
