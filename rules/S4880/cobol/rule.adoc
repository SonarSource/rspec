== Why is this an issue?

The rule S1279 ("DISPLAY" should not be used) is fully preventing the usage of the ``++DISPLAY++`` statement whereas in same cases it may be useful to output some data to SYSOUT. However, the output of a call to ``++DISPLAY UPON CONSOLE++`` is unlikely to be viewed by someone because the output is displayed on the console and nowadays no one is in front of the console to see if something is happening.
