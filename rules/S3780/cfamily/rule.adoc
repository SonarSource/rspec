It is unsafe to have ``++const++`` string reference members as they can be created from a temporary quite easily.

----
struct Foo {
  Foo(const string &Str) : Str(Str) {}
  const string &Str;
};
Foo instance("string");
----
When the constructor is called, a string temporary is created from ``++const char *++`` and destroyed immediately after. This results in a dangling reference.


This rule applies for both ``++std::string++`` and ``++::string++`` ``++const++`` reference members.
