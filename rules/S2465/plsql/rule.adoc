== Why is this an issue?

Full outer joins aren't in common use, and as a result many developers don't really understand them. Therefore, each use of this language feature should be reviewed.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN
  SELECT *
  BULK COLLECT INTO result
  FROM DUAL d1
  FULL OUTER JOIN DUAL d2 ON d1.dummy != d2.dummy; -- Noncompliant
END;
