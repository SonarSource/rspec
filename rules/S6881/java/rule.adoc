With the introduction of virtual threads in Java 21, it is now possible to optimize the usage of the operating system threads by avoiding blocking them for asynchronous operations.
Furthermore, virtual threads's instantiation has very little overhead and they can be created in large quantities.
This means that it can be more efficient to use them over the default platform threads for tasks that involve I/O or some other blocking operations.

== Why is this an issue?

Whenever a virtual thread is started, the JVM will mount it on an OS thread.
As soon as the virtual thread runs into a blocking operation like an HTTP request or a filesystem read/write operation,
the JVM will detect this and unmount the virtual thread. 
This allows another virtual thread to take over the OS thread and continue its execution.

This is why virtual threads should be preferred to platform threads for tasks that involve blocking operations. 
By default, a Java thread is a platform thread.
To use a virtual thread it must be started either with `Thread.startVirtualThread(Runnable)` or `Thread.ofVirtual().start(Runnable)`.

This rule raises an issue every time a platform thread is created with a task that includes heavy blocking operations.

=== Exceptions

If the task assigned to the thread is not a blocking operation, then it is not necessary to use a virtual thread.

[source,java]
----
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);
void enqueueRequest(float[] buff, float[] matrix){
    // bulkMatrixMultiplication is a CPU-intensive operation, that will always keep the threads busy
    executor.execute(() -> bulkMatrixMultiplication(buff, matrix));
}
----

== How to fix it

Replace platform thread instances or platform thread pools with virtual threads, if their task involves blocking operations.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

The following example utilizes a thread pool to handle the creation of new platform threads, that will be then used to perform some blocking operation.
In the event of a large number of requests being made to the `enqueueRequest` method, for example, 10000 of them, the thread pool will quickly run out of available threads,
and it will be only capable of processing 100 requests in parallel per second.
This means that in this example the total execution time for 10000 requests would be at least 100 seconds.

[source,java]
----
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);
void enqueueRequest(String data){
    // processRequest is a blocking operation that will take ~1 second to complete
    executor.execute(() -> processRequest(data)); // Noncompliant
}

static void processRequest(String data) {
    try {
        // do something with data
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
----

In this example instead, there is no limit to the number of platform threads that could be instantiated.
So the execution of 10000 requests could take just over ~1 second.
However, this could lead to problems if the number of instantiated threads exceeds the maximum number of platform threads allowed by the OS.
Moreover, the instantiation of a new platform thread has a higher overhead than the instantiation of a virtual thread.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void enqueueRequest(String data){
    new Thread(() -> processRequest(data)).start();
}
----

==== Compliant solution

Using virtual threads allows the developer to abstract from any pooling logic as they are much lighter than platform threads,
and the number of virtual threads that can be instantiated is only limited by the available memory.
In this example, the execution of 10000 requests would take just over ~1 second without any risk of exceeding the allowed number of platform threads.

[source,java,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void enqueueRequest(String data) {
  // processRequest is a blocking operation that will take ~1 second to complete
  Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> processRequest(data));
}
