A collection is a data structure that holds multiple values, such as an array or a map. If a collection is declared and populated, but its values are never read anywhere in the code, it can be considered unused code. This can be due to some refactoring, copy-pasting, or typing errors.

Unused collections can waste memory usage and slow down the application's performance. Additionally, they can make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers working on the same codebase.
