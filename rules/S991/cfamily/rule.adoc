== Why is this an issue?

Includes ``++time++``, ``++strftime++``. This library is associated with clock times. Various aspects are implementation dependent or unspecified, such as the formats of times. If any of the facilities of ``++time.h++`` are used, then the exact implementation for the compiler being used must be determined, and a deviation raised.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <time.h>  /* Noncompliant */
----


== Resources

* MISRA C:2004, 20.12 - The time handling functions of library <time.h> shall not be used.
