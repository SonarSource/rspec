== Why is this an issue?

``++std::bit_cast++`` is one of the standard functions working with binary representation. Together with other bit-level functions, it is defined in the ``++<bit>++`` header introduced by {cpp}20.


``++std::bit_cast++`` standardizes the diverse and sub-optimal approaches of reinterpreting a value as being of a different type of the same length, preserving its binary representation.


Before {cpp}20, the correct way to reinterpret a value was a call to ``++std::memcpy++``, copying the exact binary representation from a variable of one type into a variable of another. Although canonical, the use of ``++std::memcpy++`` might still be confusing; it is verbose, and it might introduce performance overhead if the compiler does not recognize the idiom and does not remove the function call.


In contrast, ``++std::bit_cast++`` clearly states the intent and is guaranteed to map to an optimal implementation.


This rule reports the uses of ``++std::memcpy++`` that can be replaced by ``++std::bit_cast++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
static_assert(sizeof(float) == sizeof(uint32_t));
float src = 1.0f;
uint32_t dst;
std::memcpy(&dst, &src, sizeof(float)); // Noncompliant: verbose and might incur performance hit
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
float src = 1.0f;
auto dst = std::bit_cast<uint32_t>(src); // Compliant
----
