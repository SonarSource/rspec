This is an issue when a class decorated with `@Directive` and having a selector does not end with the expected suffix ("Directive" by default).

== Why is this an issue?

Consistent naming conventions are essential for code maintainability and team collaboration. When directive classes follow a predictable naming pattern, developers can quickly identify the purpose and type of a class just by looking at its name.

In Angular applications, directives are a specific type of component that manipulates the DOM or adds behavior to elements. Having a clear naming convention helps distinguish directive classes from other types of classes like services, components, or plain TypeScript classes.

Without consistent naming:

* Code becomes harder to navigate and understand
* New team members struggle to identify class purposes
* Refactoring and maintenance become more difficult
* The codebase lacks professional consistency

Note that this naming convention is no longer recommended by the Angular Team as of version 20, but many teams still find it valuable for code organization.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue primarily affects code maintainability and developer experience. While it doesn't cause runtime errors, inconsistent naming can slow down development, make code reviews more difficult, and create confusion in larger codebases.

=== How to fix in Angular?

Add the "Directive" suffix to the class name. This makes it immediately clear that the class is an Angular directive.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
@Directive({
  selector: 'app-highlight'
})
class Highlight { // Noncompliant
  // directive implementation
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
@Directive({
  selector: 'app-highlight'
})
class HighlightDirective {
  // directive implementation
}
----

When using custom suffixes, ensure the class name ends with one of the configured suffixes. This example shows using a custom "Dir" suffix.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
// Configuration: { "suffixes": ["Dir"] }
@Directive({
  selector: 'app-tooltip'
})
class Tooltip { // Noncompliant
  // directive implementation
}
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
// Configuration: { "suffixes": ["Dir"] }
@Directive({
  selector: 'app-tooltip'
})
class TooltipDir {
  // directive implementation
}
----
