== Why is this an issue?

The ``++ALTER++`` statement should not be used. Trying to understand a program where the instruction as it appears may not be the actual instruction encountered by the program is very difficult, if not impossible.

If you need to change the processing sequence due to a certain condition, use ``++PERFORM++`` or ``++GO TO++`` instead.
