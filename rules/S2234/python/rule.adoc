When the names of parameters in a function/method call match the names of the method arguments, it contributes to clearer, more readable code. However, when the names match, but are passed in a different order than the function/method arguments, it indicates a mistake in the parameter order which will likely lead to unexpected results.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
def move_point(coord, speed):
    new_x = coord[0] + speed[0]
    new_y = coord[1] + speed[1]
    return (new_x, new_y)

coord = (3, 4)
speed = (1, 2)

move_point(speed, coord)  # Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
def move_point(coord, speed):
    new_x = coord[0] + speed[0]
    new_y = coord[1] + speed[1]
    return (new_x, new_y)

coord = (3, 4)
speed = (1, 2)

move_point(coord, speed)
