Just a note on that one : in order to detect those cases we have to know the names of the method parameter at declaration site. This information is not always available in bytecode, so we would have to share the semantic analysis between files to keep name of methods parameters through the analysis.

\[~nicolas.peru] if my understanding is correct, parameter names are available by default but if the javac option "-g:none" is defined, then they are no more available. Am I correct ?

\[~freddy.mallet]Your understanding is not correct : to get those information you would have to use ``++javac -g++`` to get local variables informartion, by default only line numbers and source file information is available. So you would need an extra flag on the compiler to get those from bytecode.

In fact this one might be perfectly suitable in C/{cpp} as after the pre-processing phase we do have all the required pieces of information.

And in Java, we could imagine to have a first implementation limited to the scope of the source file.
