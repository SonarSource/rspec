== Why is this an issue?

Calling a {operationName} with argument variables whose names match the {operationName} parameter names but in a different order can cause confusion. It could indicate a mistake in the arguments' order, leading to unexpected results.

include::{noncompliantCode}[]

However, matching the {operationName} parameters' order contributes to clearer and more readable code:

include::{compliantCode}[]
