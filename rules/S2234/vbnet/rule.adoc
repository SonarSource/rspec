When the names of parameters in a procedure call match the names of the procedure arguments, it contributes to a clearer, more readable code. However, when the names match but are passed in a different order than the method arguments, it indicates a mistake in the parameter order which will likely lead to unexpected results.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Public Function Divide(ByVal divisor As Integer, ByVal dividend As Integer) As Double
    Return divisor / dividend
End Function

Public Sub DoTheThing()
    Dim divisor = 15
    Dim dividend = 5

    Dim result = Divide(dividend, divisor)  ' Noncompliant; operation succeeds, but result is unexpected
    '...
End Sub
----

== Compliant Solution

----
Public Function Divide(ByVal divisor As Integer, ByVal dividend As Integer) As Double
    Return divisor / dividend
End Function

Public Sub DoTheThing()
    Dim divisor = 15
    Dim dividend = 5

    Dim result = Divide(divisor, dividend) 
    '...
End Sub
