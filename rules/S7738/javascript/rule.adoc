This rule raises an issue when `Promise.all()`, `Promise.any()`, or `Promise.race()` is called with an array containing exactly one element.

== Why is this an issue?

Passing single-element arrays to Promise methods like `Promise.all()`, `Promise.any()`, or `Promise.race()` is usually a mistake that adds unnecessary complexity.

These methods are designed to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently. When you pass a single-element array, you're not taking advantage of their core functionality - coordinating multiple promises.

For example, `Promise.all([singlePromise])` does the same thing as just awaiting `singlePromise` directly, but with extra overhead and less readable code. The array wrapper serves no purpose and can confuse other developers about your intentions.

This pattern often appears when:

* Code originally handled multiple promises but was later simplified
* Developers misunderstand how Promise methods work
* Copy-paste errors introduce unnecessary array wrapping

Using the promise directly makes your code cleaner, more performant, and clearer about your actual intent.

=== What is the potential impact?

This issue reduces code readability and adds unnecessary complexity. While it doesn't cause runtime errors, it can confuse other developers and indicates a misunderstanding of Promise APIs. The extra array allocation and method call also create minor performance overhead.

=== How to fix?


Remove the array wrapper and await the promise directly. This is cleaner and more efficient than using Promise methods with single elements.
