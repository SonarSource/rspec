The GNU compiler extension that allows ``++case++``s to be specified with ranges should only be used when a range is actually needed. Use it with the same number on both ends of the range, and you've either made a mistake because an actual range was intended, or you've used the syntax inappropriately in a way that is highly likely to confuse maintainers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
switch (i) {
  case 0: 
    //...
    break;
  case 1 ... 2:
    //...
    break;
  case 3 ... 3: // Noncompliant
    //...
    break;
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
switch (i) {
  case 0: 
    //...
    break;
  case 1 ... 2:
    //...
    break;
  case 3:
    //...
    break;
}
----
or

----
switch (i) {
  case 0: 
    //...
    break;
  case 1 ... 2:
    //...
    break;
  case 3 ... 5:
    //...
    break;
}
