== Why is this an issue?

Hardcoding the date and time format strings can lead to formats that consumers misunderstand. Also, if the same format is meant to be used in multiple places, it is easier to make a mistake when it's hardcoded instead of using a format provided by an `IFormatProvider` or using one of the standard format strings.
