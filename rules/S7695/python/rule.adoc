This rule raises an issue when `super()` calls are used in methods that are decorated with TorchScript decorators like `@torch.jit.script_method` or within classes likely to be compiled with TorchScript.

== Why is this an issue?

TorchScript has limited support for Python's `super()` mechanism, which can lead to compilation errors when converting PyTorch models for deployment.

TorchScript is PyTorch's way to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code. It allows you to run models independently from Python, which is essential for production deployment, mobile applications, and performance optimization.

However, TorchScript operates with a subset of Python's features. The `super()` function relies on Python's method resolution order (MRO) and dynamic attribute lookup, which are not fully supported in TorchScript's static compilation environment.

When TorchScript encounters `super()` calls, it may fail to properly resolve the method calls during compilation, resulting in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This is particularly problematic in `forward()` methods of neural network modules, where inheritance is commonly used.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `super()` calls in TorchScript methods can cause:

* Compilation failures when converting models to TorchScript format
* Runtime errors in deployed models
* Inconsistent behavior between eager mode and TorchScript execution
* Deployment issues in production environments and mobile applications

=== How to fix in PyTorch?

Replace super() calls with direct method calls or refactor the inheritance structure to avoid super() usage in TorchScript methods.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    @torch.jit.script_method
    def forward(self, x):
        return super().forward(x)  # Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,python,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # Avoid super() in TorchScript methods
        return self.process(x)
    
    def process(self, x):
        return x

For complex inheritance scenarios, explicitly call parent class methods by name instead of using super().

class BaseModel(nn.Module):

        return x * 2

class DerivedModel(BaseModel):
    @torch.jit.script_method
    def forward(self, x):
        result = super().forward(x)  # Noncompliant
        return result + 1
