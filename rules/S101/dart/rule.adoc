== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. In Dart the convention is that all type names should be in camel-case starting with a capital letter (aka Pascal case).

This rule raises an issue when a class name does not comply with this convention.

== How to fix it

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart]
----
class My_Class // Noncompliant,contains dash
class myClass // Noncompliant, starts with lovercase
class myclass // Noncompliant, all in lowercase
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart]
----
class MyClass
----
