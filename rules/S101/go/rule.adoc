== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a struct name does not match a provided regular expression.

The convention in Go is to use mixedCaps rather than underscores. See https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names[Go documentation] for the complete naming conventions.

Note that the casing of the first character determines if the type is exported or not.

For example, with the default provided regular expression ``++^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$++``, the struct:

[source,go]
----
type my_struct struct {...}
----

should be renamed

[source,go]
----
type myStruct struct {...}
----
