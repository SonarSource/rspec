== Why is this an issue?

Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate.

This rule allows to check that all class names (along with Objective-C interface, protocol and implementation names) match a provided regular expression.

=== Noncompliant code example

With default provided regular expression ``++^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$++``:

[source,cpp]
----
// C++
class foo // Noncompliant
{
};

// Objective-C
@interface nonCompliant : NSObject
@end
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
// C++
class Foo // Compliant
{
};

// Objective-C
@interface Compliant : NSObject
@end
----
