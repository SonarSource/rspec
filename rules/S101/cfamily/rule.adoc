== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a class name (or an Objective-C interface, protocol, or implementation name) does not match a provided regular expression.

For example, with the default provided regular expression ``++^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$++``, the following class and interface:

[source,cpp]
----
// C++
class foo // Noncompliant
{
};

// Objective-C
@interface nonCompliant: NSObject
@end
----

should be renamed to

[source,cpp]
----
// C++
class Foo
{
};

// Objective-C
@interface Compliant: NSObject
@end
----
