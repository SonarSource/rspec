== Why is this an issue?

Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all class names match a provided regular expression.


The default configuration is the one recommended by Microsoft:


* Pascal casing, starting with an upper case character, e.g. BackColor
* Short abbreviations of 2 letters can be capitalized, e.g. GetID
* Longer abbreviations need to be lower cased, e.g. GetHtml

=== Noncompliant code example

With the default regular expression ``++^([A-Z]{1,3}[a-z0-9]+)*([A-Z]{2})?$++``:

[source,vbnet]
----
Class foo ' Noncompliant
End Class
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet]
----
Class Foo ' Compliant
End Class
----
