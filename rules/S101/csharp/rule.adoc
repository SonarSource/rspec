== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.

This rule raises an issue when a type name is not PascalCased.

For example, the classes

[source,csharp]
----
class my_class {...}
class SOMEName42 {...}
----

should be renamed to

[source,csharp]
----
class MyClass {...}
class SomeName42 {...}
----

=== Exceptions

* The rule ignores types marked with `ComImportAttribute` or `InterfaceTypeAttribute`.
* To reduce noise, two consecutive upper case characters are allowed unless they form the full type name. So, `MyXClass` is compliant, but `XC` is not.
* The rule allows having ``++'_'++`` characters in class names inside test projects: in that case, each word separated by ``++'_'++`` should be PascalCased.

[source,csharp]
----
class Some_Name___42 {...} // Compliant in tests
class Some_name___42 {...} // Noncompliant
class Some_Name_XC {...} // Noncompliant because of XC, should be Some_Name_Xc
