Proper synchronization and thread management can be tricky under the best of circumstances, but it's particularly difficult in JEE application, and is even forbidden under some circumstances by the JEE standard.

This rule raises an issue for each ``Runnable``, and use of the ``synchronized`` keyword.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
  // ...

  Runnable r = new Runnable() {  // Noncompliant 
    public void run() {
      // ...
    }
  };
  new Thread(r).start();
