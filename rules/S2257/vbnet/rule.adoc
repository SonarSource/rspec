The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Standard algorithms like ``++AES++``, ``++RSA++``, ``++SHA++``, ... should be used instead.


This rule tracks custom implementation of these types from ``++System.Security.Cryptography++`` namespace:

* ``++AsymmetricAlgorithm++``
* ``++AsymmetricKeyExchangeDeformatter++``
* ``++AsymmetricKeyExchangeFormatter++``
* ``++AsymmetricSignatureDeformatter++``
* ``++AsymmetricSignatureFormatter++``
* ``++DeriveBytes++``
* ``++HashAlgorithm++``
* ``++ICryptoTransform++``
* ``++SymmetricAlgorithm++``
