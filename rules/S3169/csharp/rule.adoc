== Why is this an issue?

There's no point in chaining multiple ``++OrderBy++`` calls in a LINQ; only the last one will be reflected in the result because each subsequent call  completely reorders the list. Thus, calling ``++OrderBy++`` multiple times is a performance issue as well, because all of the sorting will be executed, but only the result of the last sort will be kept.


Instead, use ``++ThenBy++`` for each call after the first. 


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
var x = personList
  .OrderBy(person => person.Age)
  .OrderBy(person => person.Name)  // Noncompliant
  .ToList();  // x is sorted by Name, not sub-sorted
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
var x = personList
  .OrderBy(person => person.Age)
  .ThenBy(person => person.Name)
  .ToList();
----
