This rule raises an issue when a custom exception class does not end with the suffix "Exception".

== Why is this an issue?

Custom exception classes serve as a way to handle specific error conditions in your Apex code. When these classes don't follow proper naming conventions, it creates several problems.

First, unclear naming makes code harder to understand and maintain. A class named `MyError` or `CustomHandler` doesn't immediately signal to other developers that it's an exception class. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion when reading or debugging code.

Second, Apex follows Java conventions where exception classes should end with "Exception". This convention is widely recognized and expected by developers. Breaking this convention makes your code inconsistent with established patterns.

Third, proper exception naming helps with code organization and searchability. When all exception classes follow the same naming pattern, developers can quickly identify and locate them in the codebase.

Finally, some development tools and static analysis systems rely on naming conventions to provide better support, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection.

=== What is the potential impact?

Poor naming conventions for exception classes can lead to:

* Reduced code readability and maintainability
* Confusion for team members and future developers
* Inconsistency with Apex and Java conventions
* Difficulty in identifying exception classes during code reviews
* Potential issues with development tools that rely on naming patterns

== How to fix it

Rename your custom exception class to end with 'Exception' and ensure it properly extends the Exception class. Choose a descriptive name that clearly indicates the type of error condition it represents.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
public class MyError extends Exception {} // Noncompliant

public class CustomHandler extends Exception {} // Noncompliant

public class ValidationIssue extends Exception {} // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,apex,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
public class MyCustomException extends Exception {}

public class CustomProcessException extends Exception {}

public class ValidationException extends Exception {}
----
