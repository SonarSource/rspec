This rule suggests avoiding the use of "null=True" on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField in Django models. Instead, it recommends using blank=True, which allows an empty string as a valid value while still maintaining the ability to query and filter on the field.

== Why is this an issue?

Using "null=True" on string-based fields can lead to inconsistent and unexpected behavior. In Django, "null=True" allows the field to have a NULL value in the database. However, the Django convention to represent the absence of data for a string is an empty string. Having two ways to represent the absence of data can cause problems when querying and filtering on the field. For example, if a CharField with "null=True" has a value of NULL in the database, querying for an empty string will not return that object.

== How to fix it

Instead of using "null=True", use "blank=True" on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. This allows an empty string as a valid value while still maintaining the ability to query and filter on the field. If a field should not be left empty, specify a default value using the default argument.

=== Code examples
==== Noncompliant code example

[source,python]
----
class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=True)
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,python]
----
class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
----

== Exceptions

If `unique=True` and `blank=True` are both set, `null=True` is required to avoid unique constraint violations when saving multiple objects with blank values. No issue will be raised in this scenario.
