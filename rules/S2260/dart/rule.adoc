== Why is this an issue?

When the analysis succeeds, it doesn't mean that the analyzer was able to understand all the analyzed code. If the analyzer fails to parse some parts of your code, it will ignore them during the analysis. This rule will help you track these parsing failures.

There are many reasons why parsing failures can happen, here are the common ones:

* The code contains compile-time error(s)
* The types weren't resolved correctly (some dependencies are missing or files weren't generated)
* Use of new language features that are not yet supported by our analyzer.

How do they impact analysis? We cannot judge without looking at specific examples, as they contain a broad range of types of errors. On our side, we will make sure that you get notified through the analysis logs when they have an impact on the quality of the analysis.

There are three recommended ways to deal with parsing failures:

* Fix compiler errors
* Make sure all referenced generated files were generated before the analysis
* If you cannot fix them and the analysis logs donâ€™t state anything explicit about their impact, ignore them by resolving them as "won't fix".

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void fun(int x) {
  print(x) // Noncompliant, missing ';'
}

----

=== Compliant solution


[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void fun(int x) {
  print(x);
}

----

=== Noncompliant code example

Another example could be with missing generated classes

[source,dart]
----
import 'package:generated/my_classes.dart'; // Noncompliant, Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:generated/my_classes.dart'.
void main() {
     print(MyClass().name); // MyClass type is missing
}
----

To fix this, make sure code generation task was executed before the analysis.
