<p>When the analysis succeeds, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the analyzer was able to understand all the analyzed code. If the analyzer fails on some parts of your code, it will ignore them during the analysis. This rule will help you track these analysis failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many reasons why analysis failures can happen, here are the common ones:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The code contains compile-time error(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>flutter pub get</code>, <code>dart pub get</code>, or similar commands were not executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The types weren&#8217;t resolved correctly (some dependencies are missing or files weren&#8217;t generated).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of new language features that are not yet supported by our analyzer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do they impact analysis? We cannot judge without looking at specific examples, as they contain a broad range of types of errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three recommended ways to deal with analysis failures:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix compiler errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you got all project dependencies, via <code>flutter pub get</code>, <code>dart pub get</code>, &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure all referenced generated files were generated before the analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you cannot fix them, let us know through the <a href="https://community.sonarsource.com/">Sonar Community forum</a>.</p>

<p>To fix this, make sure code generation task was executed before the analysis.</p>

<p>Today, files that are not parsable by SonarQube are completely passed in the analysis phase (eg: Java.) This means that potentially bad content can seep in where SQ is being used as a Pull Request filter. It would be nice if the SonarQube system as a whole had a good answer to this. Today, work-arounds have been made for individual languages (eg: xml) which end up attempting to parse a file up to three times before an issue is raised and reported. All of these work-arounds are somewhat hackish in nature.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parse phase really needs to be able to directly report lex/parse issues.</p>
