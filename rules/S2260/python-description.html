<p>When the Python parser fails, it is possible to record the failure as a violation on the file. This way, not only it is possible to track the number of files that do not parse but also to easily find out why they do not parse.</p>

<p>Today, files that are not parsable by SonarQube are completely passed in the analysis phase (eg: Java.) This means that potentially bad content can seep in where SQ is being used as a Pull Request filter. It would be nice if the SonarQube system as a whole had a good answer to this. Today, work-arounds have been made for individual languages (eg: xml) which end up attempting to parse a file up to three times before an issue is raised and reported. All of these work-arounds are somewhat hackish in nature.</p>

<p>The parse phase really needs to be able to directly report lex/parse issues.</p>
