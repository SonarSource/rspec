When the C# parser fails, it is possible to record the failure as a violation on the file. This way, not only it is possible to track the number of files that do not parse but also to easily find out why they do not parse.

\[~tamas.vajk] many of the plugins have the ability to raise "parser failure" issues on files. That makes it easy for users to see which files didn't get analyzed for issues.


Not terribly relevant to SonarLint, but perhaps helpful on the plugin side.
