This rule raises an issue when binary files specified in the `bin` field of `package.json` would be ignored during npm publishing.

== Why is this an issue?

When you publish a Node.js package with CLI commands, you specify executable files in the `bin` field of `package.json`. However, if these binary files are excluded from publishing (either by not being listed in the `files` field or by being ignored in `.npmignore`), the package installation will fail.

Npm uses the `files` field and `.npmignore` to determine which files to include in the published package. If a binary file referenced in the `bin` field is not included, users who install your package won't be able to use the CLI commands, leading to broken functionality.

This creates a mismatch between what the package declares it provides (executable commands) and what it actually delivers (missing binary files).

=== What is the potential impact?

When binary files are missing from the published package, users will encounter errors when trying to use the CLI commands. This can lead to failed installations, broken CI/CD pipelines, and frustrated users who cannot access the advertised functionality of your package.

=== How to fix?


Include the binary file in the `files` field of package.json to ensure it gets published.
