== Sensitive Code Example

The current directory is not changed with the ``++chdir++`` function before or after the creation of a jail with the ``++chroot++`` function:

----
const char* root_dir = "/jail/";
chroot(root_dir); // Sensitive: no chdir before or after chroot, and missing check of return value
----
The ``++chroot++`` or ``++chdir++`` operations could fail and the process still have access to unauthorized resources. The return code should be checked:

----
const char* root_dir = "/jail/";
chroot(root_dir); // Sensitive: missing check of the return value
const char* any_dir = "/any/";
chdir(any_dir); // Sensitive: missing check of the return value
----

== Compliant Solution

To correctly isolate the application into a jail, change the current directory with ``++chdir++`` before the ``++chroot++`` and check the return code of both functions:

----
const char* root_dir = "/jail/";

if (chdir(root_dir) == -1) {
  exit(-1);
}

if (chroot(root_dir) == -1) {  // compliant: the current dir is changed to the jail and the results of both functions are checked
  exit(-1);
}
