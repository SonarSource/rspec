This rule raises an issue when ``++strcmp++`` or ``++strncmp++`` is called with two identical literal strings or twice the same variable.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if (strcmp("F00", "F00")) { // Noncompliant
  doSomething();
}
if (strncmp(s1, s1, 10)) { // Noncompliant
  doSomethingElse();
}
