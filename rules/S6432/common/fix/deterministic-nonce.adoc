==== Deterministically generating nonces

One method to prevent the same IV from being used multiple times for the same key is to update the IV in a deterministic way after each encryption. The most straightforward deterministic method for this is a counter.

The way this works is simple: for any key, the first IV is the number zero. After this IV is used to encrypt something with a key, it is incremented for that key (and is now equal to 1). Although this requires additional bookkeeping, it should guarantee that for each encryption key, an IV is never repeated.

For a secure implementation, NIST suggests generating these nonces in two parts: a fixed field and an invocation field. The fixed field should be used to identify the device executing the encryption (for example, it could contain a device ID), such that for one key, no two devices can generate the same nonce. The invocation field contains the counter as described above. For a 96-bit nonce, NIST recommends (but does not require) using a 32-bit fixed field and a 64-bit invocation field.
