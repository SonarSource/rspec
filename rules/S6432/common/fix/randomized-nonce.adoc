==== Generating nonces using random number generation

When using a randomized approach, NIST recommends a nonce of at least 96 bits using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG.) Such a generator can create output with a sufficiently low probability of the same number being output twice (also called a __collision__) for a long time. However, after 2^32^ generated numbers for the same key, NIST recommends rotating this key for a new one. After that amount of generated numbers, the probability of a collision is high enough to be considered insecure.

The code example above demonstrates how CSPRNGs can be used to generate nonces. 

Be careful to use a random number generator that is sufficiently secure. Default (non-cryptographically secure) RNGs might be more prone to collisions in their output, which is catastrophic for counter-based encryption modes.
