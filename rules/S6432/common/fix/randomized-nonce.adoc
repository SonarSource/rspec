When using GCM, NIST recommends a 96-bit length nonce using a 'Deterministic' approach or at least 96 bits using a 'Random Bit Generator (RBG)'. The 'Deterministic' construction involves a counter, which increments per encryption process. The 'RBG' construction, as the name suggests, generates the nonce using a random bit generator. Collision probabilities (nonce-key pair reuse) using the 'RBG-based' approach require a shorter key rotation period, 2^32 maximum invocations per key.
