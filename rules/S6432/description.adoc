When encrypting data using block ciphers with Counter (CTR) derived mode of operations such as Galois/Counter mode (GCM) or Counter with CBC-MAC mode (CCM), it is essential to not reuse the same initialization vector (IV), more specifically nonce (number used only once), and key pair.

To generate the nonce, NIST recommends a 96 bit length using a 'Deterministic' approach with a counter or a 'RBG-based' approach using an approved random bit generator. The 'RBG-based' approach requires a shorter key rotation period.
