When encrypting data with Counter (CTR) block cipher mode of operations, it is essential to not reuse the same initialization vector (IV) and key pair. Galois/Counter (GCM) and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) are both CTR-based modes of operation. 

To generate the nonce, NIST recommends a 96 bit length using a 'Deterministic' approach with a counter or a 'RBG-based' approach using an approved random bit generator. The 'RBG-based' approach requires a shorter key rotation period.
