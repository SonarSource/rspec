When encrypting data with Counter (CTR) derived block cipher modes of operation, it is essential not to reuse the same initialization vector (IV) with a given key, such IV is called a "nonce" (number used only once). Galois/Counter (GCM) and Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM) are both CTR-based modes of operation. 

Miscompliance eases the retrieval of the encryption key and allows the recovery of the plaintext for any arbitrary ciphertext, as long as another ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext, generated with the same IV-key pair, is known.

When using GCM, NIST recommends a 96 bit length nonce using a 'Deterministic' approach or at least 96 bits using a 'Random Bit Generator (RBG)'. The 'Deterministic' construction involves a counter, which increments per encryption process. The 'RBG' construction, as the name suggests, generates the nonce using a random bit generator. Collision probabilities (nonce-key pair reuse) using the 'RBG-based' approach require a shorter key rotation period, 2^32 maximum invocations per key.
