When encrypting data with Counter (CTR) block cipher mode of operations, it is essential to not reuse the same initialization vector (IV) with a given key, such IV is called a "nonce" (number used only once). Galois/Counter (GCM) and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) are both CTR-based modes of operation. 

To generate the nonce, NIST recommends a 96 bit length value using a 'Deterministic' or a 'Random Bit Generator (RBG)' approach. The 'Deterministic' construction involves a counter, which increments per encryption process. The 'RBG' construction, as the name suggests, generates the nonce using a random bit generator. Collision probabilities (nonce-key pair reuse) using the 'RBG-based' approach require a shorter key rotation period.
