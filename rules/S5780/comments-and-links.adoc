Similar to RSPEC-4143. The difference is that RSPEC-4143 focuses on key replacement in already existing maps, whereas RSPEC-5780 focuses duplicate keys in Map creation.

I changed from Bug to Code Smell because from what I can see on Peach, majority of the issues are related to duplication of the key AND the value. It means there is no impact/bug, it's a left over copy/paste. The only case where the behavior can not be the expected one is when the duplicated key is initialized with 2 different values.
