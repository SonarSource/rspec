Frequent commits are widely understood to negatively impact performance. Thus, committing inside a loop (even when only executed conditionally once every n iterations) is highly likely to cause unwanted performance impacts. 


Further, in general use ``++COMMIT++`` should only be used at the end of a transaction. Code that is not structured to have one transaction per loop iteration could yield unexpected results if ``++COMMIT++`` is nonetheless used inside the loop. Code that _is_ structured to have one transaction per loop iteration should probably be reconsidered.


Note that when dealing with very large data sets, a ``++COMMIT++`` may be required every n iterations, but the goal should be to avoid ``++COMMIT++``s inside loops.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,text]
----
FOR item IN itemlist
LOOP
  -- ...   
  COMMIT;  -- Noncompliant
END LOOP;
----


== Compliant Solution

[source,text]
----
FOR item IN itemlist
LOOP
  -- ...   
END LOOP;
COMMIT;
