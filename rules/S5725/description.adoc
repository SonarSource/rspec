Using remote artifacts without integrity checks can lead to
the unexpected execution of malicious scripts in the front-end pages.

On the client side, where front-end code is executed, malicious code could:

* gain access to sensitive data or disrupt how the website works.
* add a quiet malware that saves keystrokes (a keylogger). 
* mine cryptocurrencies in the background.

By ensuring that a remote artifact is exactly what it is supposed to be before
it is used, the client is protected from unexpected changes before it is
downloaded. +
That is to say if it has been replaced by malware on the website where it is
published, or if it was legitimately changed by its author, in a more begnin
scenario.

Important note: HTTPS protects data in transit from one host to another. It
provides authenticity and integrity checks *for the network stream*, not for
the downloaded artifact itself.
