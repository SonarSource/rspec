== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

To check the integrity of a remote artifact, hash verification is the most
reliable solution. It does ensure that the file has not been modified since the
fingerprint was computed.

In this case, the artifact's hash must:

* Be computed with a secure hash algorithm such as `SHA512`, `SHA384` or `SHA256`.
* Be compared with a secure hash that was *not* downloaded from the same source.

*Note: Use this fix together with version binding on the remote file. Avoid
downloading files named "latest" or similar, so that the front-end pages do not
break when the code of the latest remote artifact changes.*

To do so, the best option is to add the hash in the code explicitly. Follow these steps:

* download the remote artifact that is currently adding capabilities to your website
* follow https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity#tools_for_generating_sri_hashes[Mozilla's tutorial on how to generate a hash string]
* prefix the value with the algorithm name, such as
** `sha512-`
** `sha384-`
** `sha256-`
* add it in the `integrity` attribute of the `<script>` tag

For example, the following bash command gives the correct integrity string for
an example script that could be stored in `\https://cdn.example.com/3.5.6/framework.js`:

----
$ wget https://cdn.example.com/3.5.6/framework.js -q -O - \
    | shasum -b -a 384 - \
    | awk '{ print $1 }' \
    | xxd -r -p \
    | base64 \
    | awk '{ print "sha384-" $1 }'
