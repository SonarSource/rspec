This rule raises an issue when a module path in a `go.mod` file violates Go's module path naming requirements.

== Why is this an issue?

Go module paths must follow strict naming conventions to ensure compatibility across different operating systems and file systems. These requirements exist because:

* **Cross-platform compatibility**: Module paths are used as directory names in the module cache and must work on case-insensitive file systems like Windows and macOS.
* **Reserved name conflicts**: Windows reserves certain file names (like `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`) that cannot be used as directory names.
* **URL compatibility**: Module paths are often used in URLs when fetching modules from version control systems or proxies.
* **Tooling reliability**: Go tools expect module paths to follow these conventions for proper resolution and caching.

Violating these naming rules can cause:

* Build failures on different operating systems
* Module resolution errors
* Issues with module proxies and version control systems
* Problems with the module cache

The Go specification requires that module paths consist of one or more path elements separated by slashes, where each element contains only ASCII letters, digits, and limited punctuation (`-`, `.`, `_`, `~`). Path elements must not begin or end with dots, and prefixes up to the first dot must not match Windows reserved file names.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using invalid module path names can cause build failures, module resolution errors, and compatibility issues across different operating systems and development environments.

== How to fix it

Use only ASCII letters, digits, and allowed punctuation characters (-._~) in module path elements. Ensure path elements don't begin or end with dots and avoid Windows reserved names.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
module example.com/.invalid // Noncompliant
module example.com/CON     // Noncompliant
module example.com/invalid- // Noncompliant
module example.com/.hidden  // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,go,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
module example.com/valid-module
module example.com/my_module
module example.com/module123
module example.com/api.v2
----
