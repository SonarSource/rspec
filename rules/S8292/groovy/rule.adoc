This rule raises an issue when a method parameter is declared but never referenced within the method body.

== Why is this an issue?

Unused method parameters create confusion and suggest incomplete or incorrect code. They can indicate several problems:

* *Dead code*: The parameter was once used but is no longer needed after refactoring
* *Incomplete implementation*: The developer intended to use the parameter but forgot to implement the logic
* *API misunderstanding*: The parameter was added based on incorrect assumptions about how the method should work

Unused parameters make code harder to understand and maintain. They mislead other developers about the method's intended behavior and create unnecessary complexity. In Groovy's dynamic environment, unused parameters can be particularly confusing since the language's flexibility might make it unclear whether a parameter serves a purpose.

Removing unused parameters improves code clarity, reduces cognitive load, and helps prevent bugs that might arise from misunderstanding the method's interface.

=== What is the potential impact?

Unused parameters reduce code readability and maintainability. They can mislead developers about the method's purpose and may indicate incomplete or incorrect implementations that could lead to bugs.

== How to fix it

Remove the unused parameter from the method signature. If the parameter was intended to be used, implement the missing logic instead.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Long count(Map args) { // Noncompliant
    return resource.count()
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Long count() {
    return resource.count()
}
----
