When two or more components or classes are heavily dependent on each other, it can indicate that the class has too many responsibilities or that the class is tightly coupled.
This can lead to a lack of modularity, making modifying or maintaining one class difficult without affecting the others.

== Why is this an issue?
This results in a rigid and inflexible design that can lead to issues such as code duplication, poor scalability, and reduced code reusability.

Having a class that depends on too many other classes makes it harder to test in isolation.
When a class has many dependencies, it becomes more difficult to write unit tests that isolate the behavior of that class from its dependencies, leading to tests that are more complex and brittle.

Overall, having a class that depends on an excessive number of other classes can make the codebase more complex, harder to understand, harder to maintain, harder to test, and more prone to errors and bugs.
By reducing the number of dependencies between classes and adhering to good software design principles, developers can create more modular, maintainable, and testable code.

== How to fix it
//== How to fix it in FRAMEWORK NAME
To avoid tight coupling in Java, it is important to follow good design principles such as SOLID, dependency injection, and loose coupling. This can help make the code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain and modify over time.
One approach is to apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and break down the class into smaller, more focused classes. This will help to reduce the number of dependencies that the class has.
Using interfaces and abstractions can contribute to reducing the dependencies between classes.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example with a threshold of 5:

[source,java]
----
class Foo { // class Foo depends on too many classes: T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7
  T1 t1;
  T2 t2;
  T3 t3;

  public T4 compute(T5 a, T6 b) {
    T7 result = a.getResult(b);
    return (T4) result;
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,java]
----
public class Bar {
    T8 a8;
    T9 a9;
}
----
