== Why is this an issue?

The unary operators ``+`` and ``++-++`` can be used to convert some value types to numeric values. But not every value can be converted to a ``++Number++`` type; use it with an object, and result will be ``++NaN++`` (Not A Number). This can be confusing to maintainers.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
var obj = {x : 1};
doSomethingWithNumber(+obj);    // Noncompliant

function foo(){
  return 1;
}
doSomethingWithNumber(-foo);    // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
var obj = {x : 1};
doSomethingWithNumber(+obj.x);

function foo(){
  return 1;
}
doSomethingWithNumber(-foo());

var str = '42';
doSomethingWithNumber(+str);
----


=== Exceptions

Unary ``{plus}`` and ``++-++`` can be used with objects corresponding to primitive types, and ``{plus}`` can be used with ``++Date++``.

[source,javascript]
----
var b = new Boolean(true);
doSomethingWithNumber(-b);  // Compliant
var timestamp = +new Date();  // Compliant
----

\[~elena.vilchik] the exceptions look fine, but w/r/t the code samples, we can't just introduce something totally new in the Compliant Solution. The compliant solution shows the Noncompliant example in a "fixed" state. That's why I had added the string example to the Noncompliant solution, marked "compliant".
