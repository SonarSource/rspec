== Why is this an issue?

include::../../../shared_content/secrets/rationale.adoc[]

This rule flags instances of:

* Alibaba Cloud AccessKey ID
* Alibaba Cloud AccessKey secret

=== What is the potential impact?

AccessKeys are long term credentials designed to authenticate and authorize requests to Alibaba Cloud.

If your application interacts with Alibaba Cloud then it requires AccessKeys to
access all the resources it needs to function properly. Resources that can be
accessed depend on the permissions granted to the Alibaba Cloud account. +
These credentials may authenticate to the account root user who has
unrestricted access to all resources in your Alibaba Cloud account, including
billing information.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.
