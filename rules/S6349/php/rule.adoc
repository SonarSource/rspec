WordPress relies a lot on the configuration located in a file named `wp-config.php`. This file contains mostly `define` statements and each of them creates a constant for a given WordPress option. However, no warning appears if an option is misspelled: the statement simply defines a constant which is never used.

This rule raises an issue when a file named `wp-config.php` defines a constant whose name is slightly different from a known WordPress option.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_MOD', true ); // Noncompliant
define( 'Disallow_File_Mods', true ); // Noncompliant
----

== Compliant Solution

----
define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true );
