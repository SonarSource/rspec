== Why is this an issue?

WordPress relies a lot on the configuration located in a file named `wp-config.php`.
This file contains mostly `define` statements and each of them creates a constant for a given WordPress option.
However, no warning appears if an option is misspelled: the statement simply defines a constant which is never used.

This rule raises an issue when a file named `wp-config.php` defines a constant whose name is slightly different from a known WordPress option.

== How to fix it in WordPress

Fix the typing mistake or rename your custom defined constant to be more unique.
