== Why is this an issue?

Since {cpp}20, a call to `std::is_constant_evaluated()` can be used to determine whether the call occurs within a constant-evaluated context.

Typically, this function is called in the condition of an `if` statement to optimize code:
It allows different actions to be performed depending on whether an expression is evaluated at compile-time or runtime.
However, writing `if (std::is_constant_evaluated())` comes with a few caveats.

. It can be error-prone:
One may be tempted to write `if constexpr` instead of `if` but doing this always results in the condition being `true`.
S6169 explains this and other similar problems in greater depth.

. Because it looks like any regular `if` statement with a function call, it does not stand out as something semantically different and important.

. Immediate functions (see again S6169) cannot be invoked from such `if` statements, which is counterintuitive and overly restrictive.

For these reasons, {cpp}23 introduced the `if consteval` control-flow statement.
There is also a negated form: `if not consteval` (or `if ! consteval`).
These versions should be preferred since they are not error-prone, stand out with their different and concise syntax, and do not require including `<type_traits>`.

This rule raises an issue when `if (std::is_constant_evaluated())` or `if (!std::is_constant_evaluated())` are used.

//=== Exceptions
//
// The implementation ignores "complex" conditions such as
// if (std::is_constant_evaluated() && n > 0)
//
// However, this is not exposed here because such uses are really rare
// and it would not benefit most readers.

== How to fix it

Fixing the issue is fairly simple: the {cpp}23 syntax is an almost direct replacement of the older one.
The only caveat is that since `if consteval` does not have parentheses to separate the condition from the action, the braces `{ }` are not optional to delimit the body of the "then" and "else" branches.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { // Noncompliant
    // Compile-time implementation
  } else {
    // Runtime implementation
  }
}

constexpr void action(int parameter) {
  if (!std::is_constant_evaluated()) // Noncompliant
    std::cout << "Run action at runtime for " << parameter << std::endl;

  // Some code...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
  if consteval {
    // Compile-time implementation
  } else {
    // Runtime implementation
  }
}

constexpr void action(int parameter) {
  if not consteval { // The {} are required here
    std::cout << "Run action at runtime for " << parameter << std::endl;
  }

  // Some code...
}
----
