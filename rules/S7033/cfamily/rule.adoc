== Why is this an issue?

Since {cpp}20, a call to `std::is_constant_evaluated()` can be used to determine whether the call occurs within a constant-evaluated context.

Typically, this function is called in the condition of an `if` statement to optimize code:
It allows different actions to be performed depending on whether an expression is evaluated at compile-time or runtime.
However, writing `if (std::is_constant_evaluated())` comes with a few caveats.

Firstly, it can be error-prone.
One may be tempted to write `if constexpr` instead of `if` but doing this always results in the condition being `true`.
S6169 explains this and other similar problems in greater depth.

Secondly, because it looks like any regular `if` statement with a function call, it does not stand out as something semantically different and important.

For these reasons, {cpp}23 introduced the `if consteval` control-flow statement.
There is also a negated form: `if not consteval`.
These versions should be preferred since they are not error-prone, stand out with their different and concise syntax, and do not require including `<type_traits>`.
As a bonus point, the positive form also allows invoking immediate functions (see S6169).

This rule raises an issue when `if (std::is_constant_evaluated())` or `if (!std::is_constant_evaluated())` are used.

//=== Exceptions
//
// The implementation ignores "complex" conditions such as
// if (std::is_constant_evaluated() && n > 0)
//
// However, this is not exposed here because such uses are really rare
// and it would not benefit most readers.

== How to fix it

Fixing the issue is fairly simple: the {cpp}23 syntax is an almost direct replacement of the older one.
The only caveat is that braces `{ }` must be used with `if (not) consteval` to delimit the body of the "then" and "else" branches.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { // Noncompliant version
    // Compile-time implementation
  } else {
    // Runtime implementation
  }
}

constexpr void action(int parameter) {
  if (!std::is_constant_evaluated()) // Noncompliant version
    std::cout << "Run action at runtime for " << parameter << std::endl;

  // Some code...
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
  if consteval {
    // Compile-time implementation
  } else {
    // Runtime implementation
  }
}

constexpr void action(int parameter) {
  if not consteval {
    std::cout << "Run action at runtime for " << parameter << std::endl;
  }

  // Some code...
}
