== Sensitive Code Example

----
Imports System.Security.Cryptography

Sub ComputeHash()

    ' Review all instantiations of classes that inherit from HashAlgorithm, for example:
    Dim hashAlgo As HashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create() ' Sensitive
    Dim hashAlgo2 As HashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA1") ' Sensitive
    Dim sha As SHA1 = New SHA1CryptoServiceProvider() ' Sensitive
    Dim md5 As MD5 = New MD5CryptoServiceProvider() ' Sensitive

    ' ...
End Sub

Class MyHashAlgorithm
    Inherits HashAlgorithm ' Sensitive

    ' ...
End Class

== Compliant Solution

----
Imports System.Security.Cryptography

Sub ComputeHash()
    Dim sha256 = New SHA256CryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant
    Dim sha384 = New SHA384CryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant
    Dim sha512 = New SHA512CryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant

    ' ...
End Sub
