==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
var hashProvider1 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider();  // Noncompliant
var hashProvider1b = new SHA1Managed();  // Noncompliant
var hashProvider2 = (HashAlgorithm)CryptoConfig.CreateFromName("MD5");  // Noncompliant
var hashProvider3 = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA1");  // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,csharp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
var hashProvider1 = new SHA512Managed();
var hashProvider2 = (HashAlgorithm)CryptoConfig.CreateFromName("SHA512Managed");
var hashProvider3 = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA512Managed");

*Implementation details*:

The example just gives a partial list of all the HashAlgorithm subclasses. See the full list https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.hashalgorithm?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.7.2[here] (Follow the links in the "Derived" section, and each class has again subclasses). HashAlgorithm classes are created either via their constructor or with the ``++Create++`` static method.


Note that these classes exist for both .Net Framework and .Net Core.

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/security/ensuring-data-integrity-with-hash-codes[documentation] for more information.


*Why Highlight this*:

The class instantiation should be the start of any secure code review. We do not Highlight later references to HashAlgorithm instances as it would create too many issues.
