*Implementation details*:

The example just gives a partial list of all the HashAlgorithm subclasses. See the full list https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.hashalgorithm?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.7.2[here] (Follow the links in the "Derived" section, and each class has again subclasses). HashAlgorithm classes are created either via their constructor or with the ``++Create++`` static method.


Note that these classes exist for both .Net Framework and .Net Core.

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/security/ensuring-data-integrity-with-hash-codes[documentation] for more information.


*Why Highlight this*:

The class instantiation should be the start of any secure code review. We do not Highlight later references to HashAlgorithm instances as it would create too many issues.
