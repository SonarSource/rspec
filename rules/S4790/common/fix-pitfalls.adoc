=== Pitfalls

==== Framework and library support

Not all cryptographic frameworks and libraries support all of the available secure hashing algorithms. It's common for frameworks and libraries to support the `SHA-2` family of algorithms, but `SHA-3`, `BLAKE2` and `BLAKE3` support is less common.

==== Integrating with legacy systems and data

It may be necessary to use insecure hashing algorithms to integrate with older systems and data.

Legacy systems may use hashing algorithms that were considered secure at the time. It is not always possible to modify the legacy system to use a secure hashing algorithm, so the insecure algorithm must be used instead.

Legacy data may contain hashes created by algorithms that were considered secure at the time. There is no way to convert hashes between algorithms and a fresh hash must be calculated using the original data. If the original data is not immediately available, the insecure hash algorithm must remain in place to verify the data when it does become available.
