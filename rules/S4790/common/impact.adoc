=== What is the potential impact?

==== Bypassing data tampering checks

The properties of a cryptographic hash algorithm make it very good at detecting whether a piece of data has been modified. Any change to a piece of data will cause the hash to change, and it is extremely unlikely that two pieces of data will have the same hash.

If an insecure hashing algorithm is used, an attacker could forge a piece of data with the same hash as the original. The forged data would therefore be able to slip through any hash-based verifications.

Many common types of digital signatures are created by combining a hash with a public/private key pair. The data protected by these digital signatures is also vulnerable if the hash is produced by an insecure hashing function.

==== Data poisoning

Hashes are sometimes used to identify a piece of data. It is extremely unlikely that two pieces of data will have the same hash, and the identifier can be calculated from the data itself rather than having to be stored separately.

If a weak hash is used to generate this identifier, an attacker can forge a piece of data that produces the same identifier as a victim piece of legitimate data.

If the identifier is used as part of a data store, such as a cache, the attacker may be able to get their data stored ahead of the legitimate data. Attempts to store the legitimate data would fail as data with the same identifier is already present, and requests for the identifier would return the forged data. If there is any way for the attacker to evict data for a given identifier, they would also be able to overwrite the legitimate data.
