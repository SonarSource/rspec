Cryptographic hash algorithms are functions that can create a digital fingerprint ("hash") for any piece of data. Secure hash algorithms must meet the following criteria:

* The same input data always produces the same hash.
* Changing even a single bit of input data will result in a drastically different hash.
* It is not possible to start with a hash and work backward to find the original data.
* It is unfeasibly difficult to find two pieces of input data that create the same hash, a situation known as a hash collision.

Sometimes hash algorithms can contain hidden weaknesses that make it possible to produce collisions. The algorithms with known weaknesses include `MD5`, `HMAC-MD5`, `SHA-1`, `DSA` (which uses `SHA-1`), `MD2`, `MD4`, `MD6`, `HAVAL-128`, `RIPEMD`, `RIPEMD-128`, `RIPEMD-160`, and `HMAC-RIPEMD160`.
