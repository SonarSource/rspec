== How to fix it

Replace all uses of insecure hashing algorithms with secure algorithms, such as the `SHA-2` and `SHA-3` family of algorithms. The `SHA-2` family, `SHA-256` and `SHA-512` in particular, are commonly used and widely supported.

The hash produced by the replacement algorithm may be longer than the previous hash. If you cannot store the longer hash, it can be truncated to the length you can store.
