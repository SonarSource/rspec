== Why is this an issue?

{cpp} does not support polymorphic copy or move assignment operators. For example, the signature of a copy assignment operator on a "Base" class would be ``++Base& operator=(const Base& other)++``. 


And on a "Derived" class that extends "Base", it would be ``++Derived& operator=(const Derived& other)++``.


Because these are two entirely different method signatures, the second method does not override the first, and adding ``++virtual++`` to the "Base" signature does not change which method is called. 


It is possible to add an ``++operator=++`` override in a derived class, but doing so is an indication that you may need to reexamine your application architecture.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
class Base {
public:
  virtual Base& operator=(const Base& other); // Noncompliant
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  Derived& operator=(const Derived& other);
};
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
class Base {
protected:
  Base& operator=(const Base& other); // not virtual
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  Derived& operator=(const Derived& other);
};
----
