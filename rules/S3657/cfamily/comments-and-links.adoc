the meaning of which is not clear to me. It almost sounds like you expect the operation to have updated the "d" object, but surely I'm mis-reading that...?

\[~ann.campbell.2]  Before the sentence "After a copy...", there's a code example and before there's: if "b" is a "Derived" object

In my example, "d" is not updated, it can be called "source". Only "b" is updated, it can be called "dest".
