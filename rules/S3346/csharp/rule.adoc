== Why is this an issue?

An assertion is a piece of code that's used during development when the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-set-debug-and-release-configurations[compilation debug mode is activated]. It allows a program to check itself as it runs. When an assertion is `true`, that means everything is operating as expected. 

In non-debug mode, all https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.debug.assert[`Debug.Assert`] calls are automatically left out (via the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.conditionalattribute[`Conditional("DEBUG")`] mechanism). So, by contract, the boolean expressions that are evaluated by those assertions must not contain any https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)[side effects]. Otherwise, when leaving the debug mode, the functional behavior of the application is not the same anymore.

The rule will raise if the method name starts with any of the following `remove`, `delete`, `add`, `pop`, `update`, `retain`, `insert`, `push`, `append`, `clear`, `dequeue`, `enqueue`, `dispose`, `put`, or `set`, although `SetEquals` will be ignored.

=== How to fix it

In the following example, the assertion checks the return value of the remove method in the argument. Because the whole line is skipped in non-debug builds, the call to `Remove` never happens in such builds.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
Debug.Assert(list.Remove("dog"));
----

==== Compliant solution

The `Remove` call must be extracted and the return value needs to be asserted instead.

[source,csharp]
----
bool result = list.Remove("dog");
Debug.Assert(result);
----

The JAVA implementation checks for certain verbs in the method name:


* "remove"
* "delete"
* "put"
* "set"
* "add"
* "pop"
* "update"
* "retain"

We could add a few more too:

* "insert"
* "push"
* "append"
* "clear"
* "dequeue"
