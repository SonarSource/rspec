The PHP function ``++preg_replace++`` can be used to perform a search and replace based on regular expression matches. The ``++$replacement++`` parameter can contain references to capturing groups used in the ``++$pattern++`` parameter. This can be achieved with ``++\n++`` or ``++$n++`` to reference the n'th group. 

When referencing a nonexistent group, it will be substituted with an empty string. This is in general not the intended behavior, and might stay unnoticed since no warning is raised. 

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
preg_replace("/(a)(b)(c)/", "\\1, \\9, \\3", "abc"); // Noncompliant - result is "a, , c"
----

== Compliant Solution

----
preg_replace("/(a)(b)(c)/", "\\1, \\2, \\3", "abc");
