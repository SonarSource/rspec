== Why is this an issue?

The PHP function `preg_replace` can be used to perform a search and replace based on regular expression matches. The `$replacement` parameter can contain references to capturing groups used in the `$pattern` parameter. This can be achieved with `\n` or `$n` to reference the n'th group.

When referencing a nonexistent group, it will be substituted with an empty string. This is in general not the intended behavior, and might stay unnoticed since no warning is raised. 

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
preg_replace("/(a)(b)(c)/", "\\1, \\9, \\3", "abc"); // Noncompliant - result is "a, , c"
----

=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
preg_replace("/(a)(b)(c)/", "\\1, \\2, \\3", "abc");
----
