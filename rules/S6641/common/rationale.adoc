Connection strings contain a series of parameters that are structured as key/value pairs, similar to
`key1=value1;key2=value2`.

If an attacker can control values that are inserted into the connection string, they may be able to insert values that
look like additional parameters.  These additional parameters can override values that were supplied earlier in the
connection string.
