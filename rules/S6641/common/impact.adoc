An attacker can use specially-crafted values to change how the database connection is made. These values can add new
parameters to the connection string, or can override parameters that had already been specified.

==== Escalation of privilege

Some database servers allow authentication via an OS user account instead of a username and password. The database
connection is authenticated as the user running the application. When this authentication mode is used, any username or
password in the connection string are ignored.

If an attacker can force the use of this authentication mode, the connection will be made as the user that the web
application is running under. This will often be the `LocalSystem` or `NetworkService` account on Windows. Such accounts
are often given a high level of privileges on the database server.

==== Credential theft

If an attacker can change the database server in the connection string, they can have the web application connect to a
server that they control. The web application will then authenticate with that server, allowing those credentials to be
stolen.

==== Bypassing data validation

Many web applications implicitly trust data that's stored in the database. The data is validated before it is stored,
so no additional validation is performed when that data is loaded.

If an attacker can change the database server in the connection string, they can have the web application connect to a
database server that they control. Invalid data in this database could be passed to other services or systems, or could
be used to trigger other bugs and logic flaws in the web application.

==== Network traffic sniffing

The connection string can control how the connection to the database server is secured. For example, it can control
whether connections to Microsoft SQL Server use transport layer security (TLS).

If an attacker can disable these network security measures and they have some way to monitor traffic between the web
server and the database server, they will be able to see all information that's written to and read from the database.
