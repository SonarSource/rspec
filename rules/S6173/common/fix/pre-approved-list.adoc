==== Pre-Approved commands

If the application aims to execute a function from a small set of Classes, the
cleanest way to avoid this problem is to validate the input before using it in
a reflection method.

Create a list of authorized and secure classes that you want the application to
be able to execute. +
If a user input does not match an entry in this list, it should be rejected
because it is considered unsafe.

*Important note*: The application must do validation on the server side. Not on
client-side front-ends.
