There are two classes in the standard library that deal with iterations: `Iterable<T>` and `Iterator<T>`. An `Iterable<T>` represents a data structure that can be the target of the "for-each loop" statement, and an `Iterator<T>` represents the state of an ongoing traversal. An `Iterable<T>` is generally expected to support multiple traversals.

An `Iterator<T>` that also implements `Iterable<t>` by returning itself as its `iterator()` will not support multiple traversals since its state will be carried over.


This rule raises an issue when the `iterator()` method of a class implementing both `Iterable<T>` and `Iterator<t>` returns `this`.
