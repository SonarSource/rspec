== Why is this an issue?

The use of wrapper objects for primitive types is gratuitous, confusing and dangerous. If you use a wrapper object constructor for type conversion, just remove the ``++new++`` keyword, and you'll get a primitive value automatically. If you use a wrapper object as a way to add properties to a primitive, you should re-think the design. Such uses are considered bad practice, and should be refactored.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
let x = new Number("0");
if (x) {
  alert('hi');  // Shows 'hi'.
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
let x = Number("0");
if (x) {
  alert('hi');
}
----
