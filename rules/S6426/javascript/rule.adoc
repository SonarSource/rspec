Testing frameworks like Mocha and Jest provide a way to run a single test case for a file by appending `.only()` to the test function. This is convenient when debugging a specific use case. It makes, however, no sense to have it in production or development, and it was likely left by mistake after such a debugging session.
Therefore, it is strongly recommended not to commit usages of `.only()` to version control.

== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,javascript]
----
describe("MyClass", function () {
    it.only("should run correctly", function () {
        /*...*/
    });
});
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,javascript]
----
describe("MyClass", function () {
    it("should run correctly", function () {
        /*...*/
    });
});
