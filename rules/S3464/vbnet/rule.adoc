== Why is this an issue?

Recursion is a technique used in computer science to define a problem in terms of the problem itself, usually in terms of a simpler version of the problem itself.

For example the implementation of the generator for the n-th value of the Fibonacci sequence comes naturally from its mathematical definition, when recursion is used:

[source,vbnet]
----
Shared Function NthFibonacciNumber(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer
    If n <= 1 Then
        Return 1
    Else
        Return NthFibonacciNumber(n - 1) + NthFibonacciNumber(n - 2)
    End If
End Function
----

As opposed to:

[source,vbnet]
----
Shared Function NthFibonacciNumber(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer
    Dim previous As Integer = 0
    Dim last As Integer = 1

    For i = 0 To n - 1
        Dim temp = previous
        previous = last
        last = last + temp
    Next

    Return last
End Function
----

Use of recursion is acceptable in methods, like the one above, where you can break out of it. 

[source,vbnet]
----
Shared Function NthFibonacciNumber(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer
    If n <= 1 Then
        Return 1 ' Base case => stop recurring
}
----

It is also acceptable and makes sense in some type definitions:

[source,vbnet]
----
Class Box(Of T)
    Inherits IComparable(Of Box(Of T))

    Public Function CompareTo(ByVal other As Box(Of T)?) As Integer
        ' Compare the two Box<T> instances...
    End Function
End Class
----

With types, some invalid recursive definitions are catched by the compiler:

[source,vbnet]
----
Class C2(Of T)               ' Error BC31447 C2(Of T) cannot reference itself in Inherits clause
    Inherits C2(Of T)
End Class

Class C2(Of T)
    Inherits C2(Of C2(Of T)) ' Error BC31447 C2(Of T) cannot reference itself in Inherits clause
End Class
----

In more complex scenarios, however, the code will compile but execution will result into a `TypeLoadException` if you try to instantiate the class.

[source,vbnet]
----
Class C1(Of T)
End Class

Class C2(Of T)              ' Noncompliant
    Inherits C1(Of C2(Of C2(Of T)))
End Class

Dim c2 = New C2(Of Integer) ' This would result into a TypeLoadException
