== Why is this an issue?

Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and manageable manner. To use `await`, you need to ensure that you are calling a function or an expression that returns a promise.

The reason `await` should only be used on a promise is that it expects the operand to be a promise object. When you use `await`, it waits for the promise to be resolved or rejected and then returns the resolved value or throws the rejection reason, respectively. If the operand of `await` is not a promise, it will not behave as expected.

If you try to use `await` on a non-promise value, such as a regular object or a primitive type, it will not pause the execution of the function because there is no asynchronous behavior involved. Instead, `await` will convert the value to a resolved promise, and waits for it.

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const x = 42;
await x; // Noncompliant: x is a number, not a promise
----

You should only use `await` on promises because it is designed to handle asynchronous operations and works in conjunction with the Promise API to provide a clean and intuitive way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript.

const x = Promise.resolve(42);
await x;

Yes [~carlo.bottiglieri], Jira's handling of its own markdown is broken. It will come out fine when RuleAPI generates the description tho.
