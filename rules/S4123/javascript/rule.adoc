== Why is this an issue?

It is possible to use ``++await++`` on values which are not ``++Promise++``s, but it's useless and misleading. The point of ``++await++`` is to pause execution until the ``++Promise++``'s asynchronous code has run to completion. With anything other than a ``++Promise++``, there's nothing to wait for.


This rule raises an issue when an ``++await++``ed value is guaranteed not to be a ``++Promise++``.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
let x = 42;
await x; // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
let x = new Promise(resolve => resolve(42));
await x;

let y = p ? 42 : new Promise(resolve => resolve(42));
await y;
