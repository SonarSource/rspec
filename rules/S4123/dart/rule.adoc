== Why is this an issue?

Futures are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and manageable manner. To use `await`, you need to ensure that you are calling a function or an expression that returns a future.

The reason `await` should only be used on a future is that it expects the operand to be a future object. When you use `await`, it waits for the future to be resolved or rejected and then returns the resolved value or throws the rejection reason, respectively. If the operand of `await` is not a future, awaiting it is redundant and might not have been the developer's intent.

If you try to use `await` on a non-future value, such as a regular object or a primitive type, it will not pause the execution of the function because there is no asynchronous behavior involved. Instead, `await` will convert the value to a resolved future, and waits for it.
