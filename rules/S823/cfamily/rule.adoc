== Why is this an issue?

Because header files are likely to be included by many source files in a project, they should not contain the definitions of objects or non-inlines, i.e. they should not declare anything that actually takes up memory. Doing so could result in multiple definitions of the same symbol.


Because a ``++struct++`` declaration takes up no memory, it can (some would say should) be placed in a header. Similarly, class declarations should also reside in header files, but not class implementations.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
// my_file.h
         void func(int, float); 
         void add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } // Noncompliant
inline void subt(int a, int b) {return a-b; }

struct {
  int i;
  char c;
};

class Point {
  int x;
  int y;

public: 
  getX() { return x };  // Noncompliant; implementation
  getY();                   // Compliant
}

typedef unsigned int unint;
unint magic = 42; // Noncompliant;

// my_file.c
#include "my_file.h"
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
// my_file.h
         void func(int, float); 
         void add(int a, int b);
inline void subt(int a, int b) {return a-b; }

struct {
  int i;
  char c;
};

class point {
  int x;
  int y;

public: 
  getX();
  getY();
}

typedef unsigned int unint;

// my_file.c
#include "my_file.h"

void add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } 
----


=== Exceptions

Because template functions and classes are not instantiable if defined outside a header file, this rule ignores template definitions in headers.

* MISRA C:2004, 8.5 - There shall be no definitions of objects or functions in a header file.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 3-1-1 - It shall be possible to include any header Ô¨Åle in multiple translation units without violating the One Definition Rule.
* MISRA C:2012, 8.5 - An external object or function shall be declared once in one and only one file

\[~ann.campbell.2] what about templates in {cpp}?


Also while this is a serious issue, I wouldn't say that definition in header file is always "bug".

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] Do you mean class templates? Like structs, they can be declared in a header. From what I'm reading, they should be (and it's easy to argue that structs should be too). Are you asking for an explicit statement in the rule to that effect?


I tagged this bug because it can lead to bugs but I was also ambivalent. What, if anything, would you suggest?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I was talking about function templates like

{noformat}

template<typename T> void f(T s) {

    std::cout << s << '\n';

}

{noformat}

IMO from the description / example not clear whether this compliant or not. And after you mentioned classes and structs - same story, requires re-reading of description several times for understanding. Probably update of examples can heavily improve situation.


Regarding tags I would say "pitfall".
