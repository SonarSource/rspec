``++enable_dl++`` is on by default and allows ``++open_basedir++`` restrictions, which limit the files a script can access, to be ignored. For that reason, it's a dangerous option and should be explicitly turned off.


This rule raises an issue when ``++enable_dl++`` is not explicitly set to 0 in _php.ini_.


== Noncompliant Code Example

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
enable_dl=1  ; Noncompliant

== Compliant Solution

[source,php]
----
; php.ini
enable_dl=0
----
