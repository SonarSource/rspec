XML standard allows the use of entities, declared in the DOCTYPE of the document, which can be https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-internal-ent[internal] or https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-external-ent[external].

The content of external entities is retrieved, during parsing of the XML file, from external storage such as file system or network, which may lead, if no restrictions are put in place, to arbitrary file disclosures or https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery[server-side request forgery (SSRF)] vulnerabilities.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE person [
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
  <!ENTITY ssrf SYSTEM "https://internal.network/sensitive_information">
]>

<person>
  <name>&file;</name>  
  <city>&ssrf;</city>
  <age>18</age>
</person>

It's recommended to limit resolution of external entities by using one of these solutions: 

* If DOCTYPE is not necessary, disable completely its use.
* If external entities are not necessary, disable completely their use.
* If external entities are necessary then:
  ** Use XML processor features, if available, to authorize only required protocols (eg: https).
  ** And use an entity resolver (and optionally an XML Catalog) to resolve only trusted entities.
