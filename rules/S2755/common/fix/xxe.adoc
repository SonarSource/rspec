==== Disable external entities

The most effective approach to prevent XXE vulnerabilities is to disable
external entity processing entirely, unless it is explicitly required for
specific use cases.
By default, XML parsers should be configured to reject the processing of
external entities. This can be achieved by setting the appropriate properties or
options in your XML parser library or framework.

If external entity processing is necessary for certain scenarios, adopt a
whitelisting approach to restrict the entities that can be resolved during XML
parsing. Create a list of trusted external entities and disallow all others.
This approach ensures that only known and safe entities are processed. +
You should rely on features provided by your XML parser to restrict the external
entities.
