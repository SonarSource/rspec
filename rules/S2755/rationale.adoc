External Entity Processing allows for XML parsing with the involvement of
external entities. However, when this functionality is enabled without proper
precautions, it can lead to a vulnerability known as XML External Entity (XXE)
attack. +
XXE attacks exploit the insecure handling of external entities in XML parsing,
enabling attackers to manipulate or disclose sensitive data, execute arbitrary
code, or cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.
