=== What is the potential impact?

==== Exposing sensitive data

One significant danger of XXE vulnerabilities is the potential for sensitive
data exposure. By crafting malicious XML payloads, attackers can reference
external entities that contain sensitive information, such as system files,
database credentials, or configuration files. When these entities are processed
during XML parsing, the attacker can extract the contents and gain unauthorized
access to sensitive data. This poses a severe threat to the confidentiality of
critical information.

==== Exhausting system resources

Another consequence of XXE vulnerabilities is the potential for
denial-of-service attacks. By exploiting the ability to include external
entities, attackers can construct XML payloads that cause resource exhaustion.
This can overwhelm the system's memory, CPU, or other critical resources,
leading to system unresponsiveness or crashes. A successful DoS attack can
disrupt the availability of services and negatively impact the user experience.
