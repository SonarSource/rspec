== Why is this an issue?

"dangerouslySetInnerHTML" is Reactâ€™s replacement for using "innerHTML" in the browser DOM.

Even if its goal is to not expose your users to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, there is a great chance you wrongly use it and finally create an XSS vulnerability. Consider refactoring your code to not use "dangerouslySetInnerHTML".
