== Why is this an issue?

When using the Backbone.js framework, the array of models inside a collection, ``++collection.models++``, should not be accessed directly. Doing so bypasses the listeners set on the collection and could put your application in a bad state.


Instead, use ``++get++``, ``++at++`` or the underscore methods.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,javascript]
----
myCollection.models.forEach(function (model) { });
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,javascript]
----
myCollection.forEach(function (model) {  });
----
