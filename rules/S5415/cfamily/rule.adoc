== Why is this an issue?

When calling `std::move` on an object, we usually expect the resulting operation to be fast, using move semantic to rip data off the source object. If, despite the call to `std::move`, the source object ends up being copied, the code might be unexpectedly slow.

This can happen:

* When `std::move` is called on an object which does not provide a specific move constructor and will resort to copying when requested to move.
* When calling `std::move` with a const argument.
* When passing the result of `std::move` as a const reference argument. In this case, no object will be moved since it's impossible to call the move constructor from within the function. `std::move` should only be used when the argument is passed by value or by r-value reference.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
struct MoveWillCopy{
  MoveWillCopy() = default;
  // This user-provided copy constructor prevents the automatic generation of a move constructor 
  MoveWillCopy(NonMovable&) = default;
  Data d;
};

void f(MoveWillCopy m);
void f(std::string s);
void g(const std::string &s);

void test() {
  MoveWillCopy m;
  f(std::move(m)); // Noncompliant: std::move is useless on objects like m: Any attempt to move it will copy it

  const std::string constS="***";
  f(std::move(constS)); // Noncompliant: constS will not be moved

  std::string s="****";
  g(std::move(s)); // Noncompliant: s is cast back to const l-value reference. g cannot move from it


}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
struct Movable{
  Movable() = default;
  // A move constructor is generated by default
  Data d;
};

void f(Movable m);
void f(std::string s);
void g(const std::string &s);

void test() {
  Movables m;
  f(std::move(m)); // Compliant: move constructor is available

  std::string s="****";
  f(std::move(s)); // Compliant:  move constructor is called

  g(s); // Compliant: no misleading std::move is used
}
----

\[~abbas.sabra]: What do you plan to do inside templates? I think I would totally ignore this rule for dependant arguments, because it might be instantiated with types for which it makes sense... (unless for instance if the const is not deduced, but is part of the template)

\[~loic.joly] I ignore instantiation and I analyze the main template. If an issue can be detected in the main template, it means that calling std::move is going to be useless in all instantiation and should be removed.
