== Why is this an issue?

While ``++END++`` will adequately close a statement, it is less clear than the use of the relevant, statement-specific ``++ENDxx++``. Thus, the statement-specific version is preferred to facilitate code maintenance and enhance clarity.


This rule is applied to the following operations: ``++CASxx++``, ``++DO++``, ``++DOU++``, ``++DOUxx++``, ``++DOW++``, ``++DOWxx++``, ``++FOR++``, ``++IF++``, ``++IFxx++`` and ``++SELECT++`` groups.
