The ``++PartCreationPolicyAttribute++`` attribute, which is part of the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), is used to specify how the exported object will be created. Therefore it doesn't make sense not to export this a class with this attribute using the ``++ExportAttribute++`` attribute.


This rule raises an issue when a class is marked as shared with a ``++PartCreationPolicyAttribute++`` but lacks a ``++ExportAttribute++``.
