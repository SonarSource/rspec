== Why is this an issue?

In https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/[Managed Extensibility Framework] (MEF), if you want to modify the default behavior for an export then you need to use the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.composition.partcreationpolicyattribute[`PartCreationPolicyAttribute`] attribute.
However, as we are talking about an export, you should not forget to also annotate your class with the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.composition.exportattribute[`ExportAttribute`] othewise the `PartCreationPolicyAttribute` has no meaning.

This rule raises an issue when a class is annotated with the `PartCreationPolicyAttribute` but not with the `ExportAttribute`.
