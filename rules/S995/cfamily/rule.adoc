== Why is this an issue?

Const correctness is an important tool for type safety. It allows for catching coding errors at compile time and it documents the code for maintainers.

Correctly const-qualifying pointers can be tricky because the indirection they add can also be const.

For a pointer `X * ptr`, const can be written in three different places:

* `const X * ptr` and `X const * ptr` are identical and mean that the X object `ptr` points to cannot be changed.
* `X * const ptr` means that the pointer cannot be changed to point to a different X object.

In a function signature, the first `const X * ptr` (or its equivalent `X const * ptr`) is the one that will bring type-safety. It protects against changing the value pointed at.

[source,cpp]
----
void externalFunction(int * a, const int * b);

void myfunc() {
  int a = 1;
  int b = 2;
  externalFunction(&a, &b);
  // a can now have any value
  // We know that b is still '2'
}
----

This rule detects when a pointer or reference parameter could be made const

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void myfunc (      int * param1,  // object is modified
             const int * param2,
                   int * param3, // Noncompliant
             int * const param4) // Noncompliant: const doesn't qualify what is pointed at.
{
  *param1 = *param2 + *param3 + *param4;
}

void increment (int & value,
                int & increment) // Noncompliant
{
  value += increment;
}
----

When adding all possible `const` qualifications, we get:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void myfunc (      int * param1,  // object is modified
             const int * param2,
             const int * param3,
             const int * param4)
{
  *param1 = *param2 + *param3 + *param4;
}

void increment (int & value,
                const int & increment)
{
  value += increment;
}

The current implementation of this rule has one limitation: MISRA has the exception that in a set of overridden function, on of the function modifying a parameter is enough to require all functions to modify it. But implementing this exception requires project level analysis, that we don't currently support.
