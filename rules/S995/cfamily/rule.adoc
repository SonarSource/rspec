== Why is this an issue?

This rule leads to greater precision in the definition of the function interface. The ``++const++`` qualification shall be applied to the object pointed to, not to the pointer, since it is the object itself that is being protected.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void myfunc (      int * param1,  // object is modified
             const int * param2,
                   int * param3, // Noncompliant
                   int * param4) // Noncompliant
{
  *param1 = *param2 + *param3 + *param4;
}

int main (int argc,
          const char * * argv) // Noncompliant
{
  return argc;
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void myfunc (      int * param1,  // object is modified
             const int * param2,
             const int * param3,
             const int * param4)
{
  *param1 = *param2 + *param3 + *param4;
}

int main (int argc,
          const char * const * argv)
{
  return argc;
}

* MISRA C:2004, 16.7 - A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is not used to modify the addressed object.
* MISRA {cpp}:2008, 7-1-2 - A pointer or reference parameter in a function shall be declared as pointer to const or reference to const if the corresponding object is not modified.
* MISRA C:2012, 8.13 - A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible
