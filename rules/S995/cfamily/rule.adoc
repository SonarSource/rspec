== Why is this an issue?

Const correctness is an important tool for type safety. It allows for catching coding errors at compile time and it documents the code for maintainers.

Const qualifying correctly a pointer might be tricky at first because the indirection they add can also be const:
for a pointer `X * ptr`, const can be written in three different places:

* `const X * ptr` and `X const * ptr` are identical and mean that the X object we point to cannot be changed.
* `X * const ptr` means that the pointer cannot be changed to point to a different X object.

In a function signature, the first `const X * ptr` (or its equivalent `X const * ptr`) is the one that will bring type-safety. It protects against changing the value pointed at.

[source,cpp]
----
void externalFunction(int * a, const int * b);

void myfunc() {
  int a = 1;
  int b = 2;
  externalFunction(&a, &b);
  // a can now have any value
  // We know that b is still '2'
}
----

With multiple levels of pointers, all possible levels except the highest should be const if possible:

[source,cpp]
----
void myfunc(const int * const * const * param);
----

This rule detects when a pointer or reference parameter could be made const

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void myfunc (      int * param1,  // object is modified
             const int * param2,
                   int * param3, // Noncompliant
             int * const param4) // Noncompliant: const doesn't qualify what is pointed at.
{
  *param1 = *param2 + *param3 + *param4;
}

void increment (int & value,
                int & increment) // Noncompliant
{
  value += increment;
}

int main (int argc,
          const char * * argv) // Noncompliant: we could add another level of const protection
{
  return argc;
}
----

When adding all possible `const` qualifications, we get:

[source,cpp,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void myfunc (      int * param1,  // object is modified
             const int * param2,
             const int * param3,
             const int * param4)
{
  *param1 = *param2 + *param3 + *param4;
}

void increment (int & value,
                const int & increment)
{
  value += increment;
}

int main (int argc,
          const char * const * argv)
{
  return argc;
}

The current implementation of this rule has one limitation: MISRA has the exception that in a set of overridden function, on of the function modifying a parameter is enough to require all functions to modify it. But implementing this exception requires project level analysis, that we don't currently support.
