Unnamed constructors declarations and invocations, which are declarations and invocations of constructors via the name of their enclosing type only, should be preferred to the `.new` constructor syntax.

== Why is this an issue?

Dart has both https://dart.dev/language/constructors#named-constructors[named] and unnamed constructors.

Named constructors are declared with a name, pretty much like methods, and can be invoked combinining the name of the enclosing type and the name of the constructor (e.g. `MyClass.myNamedConstructor()`).

Unnamed constructors can either be declared without a name, or with the special name `new`. They can either be invoked using the name of the enclosing type only (e.g. `MyClass()`), or using the `.new` keyword (e.g. `new MyClass()`).

The `.new` declaration and the name-less declaration are equivalent: they are two altenate syntaxes with the same meaning, and they are mutually exclusive. Declaring both in the same class will result in a compilation error:

[source,dart]
----
class AClass {
  AClass() {}
  AClass.new() {} // Error: The unnamed constructor is already defined
}
----

On the invocation end, invoking unnamed constructors with the `.new` keyword is redundant and should be avoided, to reduce unnecessary verbosity, improve code readability, and promote consistency.

== How to fix it

Remove the `.new` part of the constructor declaration and/or invocation.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
class AClass {
  AClass.new() { // Noncompliant: unnamed constructor declaration with `.new`
    // ...
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
class AClass {
  AClass() {
    // ...
  }
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
final instance = AClass.new(); // Noncompliant: unnamed constructor invocation with `.new`
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
final instance = AClass();
----

=== Message

Unnecessary '.new' constructor name.

=== Highlighting

The `new` keyword in the constructor declaration or invocation, without the `.` preceding it.
