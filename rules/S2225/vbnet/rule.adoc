== Why is this an issue?

Calling https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring[ToString()] on an object should always return a `string`. Thus, overriding the ToString method should never return `Nothing`, as it breaks the method's implicit contract, and as a result the consumer's expectations.

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Overrides Function ToString() As String
    Return Nothing ' Noncompliant
End Function
----

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Overrides Function ToString() As String
    Return ""
End Function
