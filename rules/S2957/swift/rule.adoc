== Why is this an issue?

When a closure contains only a ``++return++`` statement, the ``++return++`` itself can be omitted.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
someList.sort { a, b in
  return a > b
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,swift]
----
someList.sort { a, b in a > b }
----
