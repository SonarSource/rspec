Declaring that a method ``throws`` an exception type that it doesn't is like a wart on the code: seemingly ugly but harmless. Unfortunately, like warts, those un-thrown exceptions will spread as each calling method is forced to deal with the ``throws`` declaration. Eventually, your code is so covered in warts that you can't see the form beneath.

Which is why this rule raises an issue when a method declares an exception type it doesn't actually throw.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void output(String text) throws NumberFormatException {  // Noncompliant
  System.out.println(text);
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public void output(String text) {
  System.out.println(text);
}
----
