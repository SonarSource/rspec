The relating find-sec-bug rule is :  \http://h3xstream.github.io/find-sec-bugs/bugs.htm#LDAP_INJECTION


it checks for classes with use of methods : 

"com/unboundid/ldap/sdk/LDAPConnection.search(String, SearchScope, String, String[])" or "javax/naming/directory/InitialDirContext.search(String, String, SearchControls)"

And verify that methods ``++search++`` use constant string or string literal (between other "safe values") for parameters when they are called.

For the record (and 3 years later), using placeholders in the filter expression will correctly handle escaping, else this method would be pretty useless - cc [~freddy.mallet] [~sebastien.gioria]


So it is wrong to state that the JNDI LDAP API does not provide a functionally similar to SQL prepared statements.

String user = "admin";
String pass = "secret";

// Setting this will not bypass authentificated
// Instead it will literally look for such a user ID

NamingEnumeration<SearchResult> results = ctx.search("ou=system", "(&(uid={0})(userPassword={1}))", new String[]{user, pass}, new SearchControls());
if (results.hasMore()) {
  System.out.println("auth'ed!");
} else {
  System.out.println("no such user");
