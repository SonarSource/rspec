=== What are the possible effects?

In the context of a web application vulnerable to LDAP injection: +
After discovering the injection point, attackers inject data into the
vulnerable field to execute malicious LDAP commands.

The impact of this vulnerability depends on how vital LDAP servers are to the
organization.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate the various impacts of an
attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

==== Data leakage or corruption

In typical scenarios where systems perform innocuous LDAP operations to find
users or create inventories, an LDAP injection could result in a data leak or
data corruption.

==== Privilege escalation

A malicious LDAP query could allow an attacker to impersonate an average user
or administrator In scenarios where systems perform authorization checks or
authentication.

A long-term goal of such an attack is to find persistence points within an
organization by gathering authentication bypasses. A short-term goal could be
data leaks and rapid infrastructure penetration.
