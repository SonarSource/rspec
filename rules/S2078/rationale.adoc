LDAP injections occur in an application when the application retrieves
untrusted data and inserts it into an LDAP query without sanitizing it first.

An LDAP injection can either be basic or blind, depending on whether the
server's fetched data is directly returned in the web application's response. +
The absence of the corresponding response for the malicious request on the
application is not a barrier to exploitation. Thus, it must be treated the same
way as basic LDAP injections.
