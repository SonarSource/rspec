== How to fix it in .NET

=== Code examples

The following noncompliant code is vulnerable to LDAP injections because untrusted data is
concatenated in an LDAP query without prior validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Public Function Authenticate(user As String, pass As String) As IActionResult
        Dim directory As New DirectoryEntry("LDAP://ou=system")
        Dim search As New DirectorySearcher(directory)

        search.Filter = "(&(uid=" + user + ")(userPassword=" + pass + "))"

        Return Json(search.FindOne() IsNot Nothing)
    End Function
End Class
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Public Function Authenticate(user As String, pass As String) As IActionResult
        ' restrict the username and password to letters only
        If Not Regex.IsMatch(user, "^[a-zA-Z]+$") OrElse Not Regex.IsMatch(pass, "^[a-zA-Z]+$") Then
            Return BadRequest()
        End If

        Dim directory As New DirectoryEntry("LDAP://ou=system")
        Dim search As New DirectorySearcher(directory)

        search.Filter = "(&(uid=" + user + ")(userPassword=" + pass + "))"

        Return Json(search.FindOne() IsNot Nothing)
    End Function
End Class

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/validation.adoc[]

In the compliant solution example, a validation mechanism is applied to untrusted input to ensure
it is strictly composed of alphabetic characters.
