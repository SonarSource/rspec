== How to fix it in .NET

=== Code examples

The following noncompliant code is vulnerable to LDAP injections because untrusted data is
concatenated in an LDAP query without prior validation.

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Public Function Authenticate(User As String, Pass As String) As IActionResult
        Dim Directory As New DirectoryEntry("LDAP://ou=system")
        Dim Search As New DirectorySearcher(Directory)

        Search.Filter = "(&(uid=" & User & ")(userPassword=" & Pass & "))"

        Return Json(Search.FindOne() IsNot Nothing)
    End Function
End Class
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,vbnet,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
Public Class ExampleController
    Inherits Controller

    Public Function Authenticate(User As String, Pass As String) As IActionResult
        ' restrict the username and password to letters only
        If Not Regex.IsMatch(User, "^[a-zA-Z]+$") OrElse Not Regex.IsMatch(Pass, "^[a-zA-Z]+$") Then
            Return BadRequest()
        End If

        Dim Directory As New DirectoryEntry("LDAP://ou=system")
        Dim Search As New DirectorySearcher(Directory)

        Search.Filter = "(&(uid=" & User & ")(userPassword=" & Pass & "))"

        Return Json(Search.FindOne() IsNot Nothing)
    End Function
End Class

=== How does this work?

include::../../common/fix/validation.adoc[]

In the compliant solution example, a validation mechanism is applied to untrusted input to ensure
it is strictly composed of alphabetic characters.
