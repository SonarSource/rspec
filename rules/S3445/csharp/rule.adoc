== Why is this an issue?

When rethrowing an exception, you should do it by simply calling ``++throw;++`` and not ``++throw exc;++``, because the stack trace is reset with the second syntax, making debugging a lot harder.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,csharp]
----
try
{}
catch(ExceptionType1 exc)
{
  Console.WriteLine(exc);
  throw exc; // Noncompliant; stacktrace is reset
}
catch (ExceptionType2 exc) 
{
  throw new Exception("My custom message", exc);  // Compliant; stack trace preserved
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,csharp]
----
try
{}
catch(ExceptionType1 exc)
{
  Console.WriteLine(exc);
  throw;
}
catch (ExceptionType2 exc) 
{
  throw new Exception("My custom message", exc);
}
