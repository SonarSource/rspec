== Why is this an issue?

Dart provides the operator `as` to cast an expression to a specific type, and `is`/`is!` to check the assignment compatibility with a type.
These operators are used for downcasts, smart casts, and run-time type checking.

In case the `as` operator is used for upcasting from a subtype to a supertype, the cast is redundant as it has no effect and can never fail.
If a specific type is expected, an expression of a subtype can always be inserted without casting (Substitution Principle and Assignment Compatibility).

Likewise, the `is` operator is redundant and will always return `true` if the type of the expression on the left
side is assignment compatible with the type on the right.

=== What is the potential impact?

==== Code redundancy

Since the operation will always succeed and has no side effects, it is pointless to use it.

Conditions with `is` will lead to dead code branches because they will always or never be satisfied.

== How to fix it

Remove the operator and all dead code branches that result from it, or investigate why the expression that is cast or checked has an unexpected compile-time type.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
void types(num n) {
  if (n is int) {
    (n as int).isOdd; // Noncompliant: n is already known to be of type int
  }
}
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
void types(num n) {
  if (n is int) {
    n.isOdd;
  }
}
----

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
bool f<T>(T a) => a is Object?; // Noncompliant: the type check is always true
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,dart,diff-id=2,diff-type=compliant]
----
bool f<T>(T a) => a is Object;
----
