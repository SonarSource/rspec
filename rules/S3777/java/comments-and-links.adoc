I think compliant example should show full way to the ``++String++`` , so it is really clear how to replace the code. Also I believe that this case will be quite rare, because usually there will be some embedded variables in the append calls, and then it's not so easy to fix (probably it would be necessary to introduce some kind of template engine). Maybe we should just flag this and do not try to offer compliant solution?
