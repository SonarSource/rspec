== Why is this an issue?

Shared naming conventions improve readability and allow teams to collaborate efficiently.
In Dart the convention is that all package names should be in lowercase with parts separated with underscore. This rule checks that all package names comply with this convention.

Noncompliant package names:

* myPackage
* My_Package

Compliant package name:

* my_package
