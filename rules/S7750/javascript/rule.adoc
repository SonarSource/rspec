This is an issue when using `.filter()` followed by array access methods like `[0]`, `.at(-1)`, `.shift()`, `.pop()`, or destructuring to get a single element from an array.

== Why is this an issue?

Using `.filter()` to find a single element is inefficient and unclear in intent.

The `.filter()` method processes the entire array and creates a new array containing all matching elements. When you only need the first or last matching element, this approach has several problems:

* *Performance overhead*: `.filter()` continues processing even after finding matches, while `.find()` stops immediately upon finding the first match
* *Memory waste*: An intermediate array is created unnecessarily
* *Unclear intent*: The code suggests you want multiple elements when you actually want just one

The `.find()` method is specifically designed for finding the first matching element, and `.findLast()` for finding the last matching element. Both methods:

* Stop execution as soon as they find a match (or reach the end)
* Return the element directly, not wrapped in an array
* Make the code's intent crystal clear

This pattern is especially problematic in performance-critical code or when working with large arrays, where the unnecessary processing can become a bottleneck.

=== What is the potential impact?

Using `.filter()` instead of `.find()` or `.findLast()` can lead to unnecessary performance overhead, especially with large arrays. The code also becomes less readable and maintainable, as the intent to find a single element is obscured by the filtering operation.

=== How to fix?


Replace `.filter()` followed by `[0]` or `.shift()` with `.find()` to get the first matching element more efficiently.

==== Non-compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
const item = array.filter(x => isUnicorn(x))[0]; // Noncompliant
const item2 = array.filter(x => isUnicorn(x)).shift(); // Noncompliant
----

==== Compliant code example

[source,javascript,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
const item = array.find(x => isUnicorn(x));
const item2 = array.find(x => isUnicorn(x));
