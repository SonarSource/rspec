The performance of queries made against large database tables is considerably improved when the columns in the ``where`` clause are indexed. If all the columns in the ``where`` clause are included in an index, then the selection can be made directly against the index, but using even a single indexed column can improve performance. Therefore, indexes should be created on large tables to improve query performance.
