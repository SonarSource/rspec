<p>The performance of queries made against large database tables is considerably improved when the columns in the <code>where</code> clause are indexed. If all the columns in the <code>where</code> clause are included in an index, then the selection can be made directly against the index, but using even a single indexed column can improve performance. Therefore, indexes should be created on large tables to improve query performance.</p>

<p>\[~freddy.mallet] this is our beta rule that&#8217;s we&#8217;re waiting on client feedback for. It was initially implemented w/out a ticket, so there&#8217;s not one to tie it to. I suppose we could create a ticket to update the description&#8230;&#8203;?</p>
