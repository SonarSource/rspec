A cleanly coded web application will have a  clear separation of concerns, with business logic in the ``++@Service++`` layer, and communication with other systems in the data access layer.


To help enforce such a separation of concerns, this rule raises an issue when a ``++@Service++`` class has ``++RestTemplate++``, ``++JmsTemplate++``, ``++WebServiceTemplate++``, ``++JdbcTemplate++``, or ``++DataSource++`` member.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
@Service ("greetingmanager")
public class GreetingManagerImpl implements GreetingManager
{
    @Autowired
    DataSource ds;  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
@Service ("greetingmanager")
public class GreetingManagerImpl implements GreetingManager
{
    @Autowired
    GreetingDao gdao;  // DataSource and its use have been moved here
----
