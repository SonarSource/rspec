\[~elena.vilchik] note that I've converted this to a subtask of a rule with a more widely-applicable name. Since it's not implemented yet in Swift, I don't anticipate problems with that, but let me know if there are.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Unfortunately, it was already implemented. So it's wrong rule key in release (S2963 instead of S3255). WDYT should be done to fix this inconsistency?

After discussion with [~elena.vilchik]:

Because Swift version had already been coded and released, this task became the parent, to preserve the rule key, and its contents swapped to the more generic ``++this++``. A new Swift subtask was created, preserving the original contents of this RSpec.

This rule was untargeted for C#, because Visual Studio 2015 reports this to the user in the IDE by default. (The rule ID is IDE0003)
