== Why is this an issue?

Directives in the php.ini files can be of type ``++boolean++``, ``++integer++`` or ``++string++``.

For ``++boolean++`` acceptable values are ``++0++``, ``++1++``, ``++true++``, ``++false++``, ``++yes++``, ``++no++``, ``++on++`` and ``++off++``.

For ``++integers++`` they can be qualified with ``++k++``, ``++m++`` or ``++g++``. E.g. 16k means 16000.

The complete list of directive is at \http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,php]
----
allow_url_include = 42; Noncompliant, should be a boolean
max_execution_time = "1024"; Noncompliant, should be an integer
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,php]
----
allow_url_include = false
max_execution_time = 1024
----
