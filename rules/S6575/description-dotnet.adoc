Since .NET 6 you don't have to use the `TimeZoneConverter` library to manually do the conversion between IANA and Windows timezones.
The .NET 6.0 introduced new Time Zone enhancements, one being the `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(string timezone)` method now accepts as input both IANA and Windows time zone IDs on any operating system with installed time zone data.
`TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById` will automatically convert its input from IANA to Windows and vice versa if the requested time zone is not found on the system.
