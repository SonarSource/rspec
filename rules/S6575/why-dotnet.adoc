== Why is this an issue?

The method `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(string timezone)` can get both IANA and Windows timezones as input and automatically convert one to the other if the requested time zone is not found on the system.
Because one does not need to handle the conversion, the code will be less complex and easier to maintain.
