The method `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(string timezone)` can get both IANA and Windows timezones as input and automatically convert one to the other if the requested time zone is not found on the system.
This means that one does not have to handle the conversion and make the code more complicated and thus more difficult to maintain.
