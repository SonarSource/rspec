== How to fix it

There's no need to manually translate between time zones - calling `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(string timezone)` where the timezone can be IANA or Windows format, is enough.
Depending on the envirorment, the equivalent time zone will be returned (Windows Time Zones for Windows and IANA timezones for Linux, macOS, Java, Python etc.)
