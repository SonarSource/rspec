== How to fix it

There's no need to translate manually between time zones; it is enough `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(string timezone)`, where the timezone can be IANA or Windows format.
Depending on the environment, the equivalent time zone will be returned (Windows Time Zones for Windows and IANA timezones for Linux, macOS, Java, Python, etc.)
