Marking an array ``++volatile++`` means that the array itself will always be read fresh and never thread cached, but the items _in_ the array will not be. Similarly, marking a mutable object field ``++volatile++`` means the object _reference_ is ``++volatile++`` but the object itself is not, and other threads may not see updates to the object state.


This can be salvaged with arrays by using the relevant AtomicArray class, such as ``++AtomicIntegerArray++``, instead. For mutable objects, the ``++volatile++`` should be removed, and some other method should be used to ensure thread-safety, such as synchronization, or ThreadLocal storage.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
private volatile int [] vInts;  // Noncompliant
private volatile MyObj myObj;  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
private AtomicIntegerArray vInts;
private MyObj myObj;
----
