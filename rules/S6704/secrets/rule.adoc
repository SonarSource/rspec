=== What is the potential impact?

Riot API keys are used to access the Riot Games API, which provides developers
with programmatic access to various data and services related to Riot Games'
products, such as League of Legends. These API keys are used to authenticate and
authorize requests made to the API, allowing developers to retrieve game data,
player statistics, match history, and other related information.

If a Riot API key is leaked to an unintended audience, it can have significant
consequences. One of the main risks is unauthorized access. The unintended
audience may exploit the leaked API key to gain entry to the Riot Games API.
This can result in the unauthorized retrieval of sensitive data and misuse of
services provided by the API. It poses a serious security threat as it
allows individuals to access information that they should not have access to,
potentially compromising the privacy and integrity of the data.
