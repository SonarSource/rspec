=== Noncompliant code example

[source,vbnet]
----
Public Sub Encrypt(Key() As Byte, Data() As Byte, Target As MemoryStream)
    Dim InitializationVector As Byte() = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
    Using Aes As New AesCryptoServiceProvider()
        Dim Encryptor As ICryptoTransform = Aes.CreateEncryptor(Key, InitializationVector)  ' Noncompliant, hardcoded value Is used
        Using CS As New CryptoStream(Target, Encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write)
            CS.Write(Data)
        End Using
    End Using
