==== Use unique IVs

To ensure complete security, the initialization vectors for each encryption
operation must be unique and random.

The IV need not be kept secret, and the strength of the random algorithm
does not matter.
In the previous non-compliant example, the problem is not that the IV is hard-coded. +
It is that the same IV is used for multiple encryption attempts.
