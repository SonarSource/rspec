==== Treat IVs as secret as passwords

To make them completely secure, initialization vectors must meet three
important criteria:

* IVs must be unique for each encryption operation.
* Secure random number generators should be used to generate unpredictable IVs
* IVs should be kept as secret as passwords or secret keys

If any of these criteria are not met, the encrypted data is at risk. In this
case, the hardcoded IV from the non-compliant code sample is a risk because it
does not meet any of the criteria.
