==== Use unique IVs

To ensure strong security, the initialization vectors for each encryption operation 
must be unique and random but they do not have to be secret.

In the previous non-compliant example, the problem is not that the IV is hard-coded. +
It is that the same IV is used for multiple encryption attempts.
