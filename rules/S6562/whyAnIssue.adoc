Not knowing what kind of date the application is using can lead to misunderstanding when printing or comparing dates. When there is a `DateTime` constructor with an overload that takes the same parameters and a `DateTimeKind`, the one with `DateTimeKind` should be used. This helps the application and its maintainers understand what kind of date is being managed. Most applications handle the same `DateTimeKind`, being intentional about it will reduce the chance of a later mismatch between `DateTime` isntances.
