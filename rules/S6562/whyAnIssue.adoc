Not knowing the `Kind` of the `DateTime` object that an application is using can lead to misunderstandings when displaying or comparing such objects. Explicitly setting the `Kind` property helps the application to stay consistent, and its maintainers understand what kind of date is being managed.
To achieve this, when there is a `DateTime` constructor with an overload that takes the same parameters and, additionally, the `DateTimeKind`, you should always use it.
