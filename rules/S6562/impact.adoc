Creating the `DatTime` object without specifying the kind explicitly will set the default value of `DateTimeKind.Unspecified`. In this case calling the method `ToUniversalTime` will assume it was a local time while calling `ToLocalTime` will assume the time is UTC. This might lead to mismatched `DateTime` objects in your application.
Not being intentional about the kind can also lead to misinterpretted dates and times when shown to users.
