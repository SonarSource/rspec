== Why is this an issue?

When a variable appears in a compound expression (for instance ``a{plus}{plus}`` or `a+=2`), the variable is accessed twice. This detail only matters for `volatile` variables. And it may not be obvious to all developers that two accesses happen while the variable is only named once. The standard was not explicit on this topic up until {cpp}23.

As a consequence, it is usually clearer to rewrite the code so that the variable appears twice, matching the accesses that will happen.

In C++, it usually does not matter how many times you access a variable, as long as the variable value is the right one. This is not the case when the variable is in a memory region that is mapped to external hardware. In that case, for instance, several successive reads can yield different values (if the memory is updated by the hardware in-between) and several writes of the same value may be significant (some hardware trigger events each time a memory location is written to). 

To specify that every read and write has an impact outside of the abstract machine of the language, access to a variable may be qualified as `volatile`. In that case, the program must perform all reads and writes that are specified, without optimizing anything away.

Note: In {cpp}20, compound expressions on volatile variables were deprecated. This deprecation was removed in {cpp}23, and the number of accesses was made explicit. The reason for removing the deprecation is that such operations are commonly used in embedded code, especially to access specific bits of a variable. However, using a function with a dedicated name instead of direct bit manipulation usually leads to code that is easier to read.

=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f1(int volatile* p) {
  ++(*p); // Noncompliant
}

void f2(volatile int& in) {
  in += 2; // Noncompliant
}

void f3(volatile int& in) {
  int i = in = 2; // Noncompliant
}
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f1(int volatile* p) {
  auto val = *p;  // One access to read the register
  *p = val + 1; // One access to write to it (and potentially overwrite another change)
}

void f2(volatile int& in) {
  auto val = in;
  in = val + 2;
}

void f3(volatile int& in) {
  in = 2;
  int i = in;
}
