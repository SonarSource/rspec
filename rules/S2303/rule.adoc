Exception specifications never really provided any advantages in C++. They have been deprecated since C++11, and removed since C++17 (specification with an exception) and C++20 (empty throw specification). If your code still contains some, you should replace empty `+throw()+` specifications, with `+noexcept+` and remove any other specifications.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void f() throw(); // Noncompliant
void g() throw(std::exception); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void f() noexcept;
void g();
----


== Exceptions

If a derived class overrides a function with a dynamic exception specification, then the derived function is forced to add a compatible exception specification. Such exception specifications are ignored.
