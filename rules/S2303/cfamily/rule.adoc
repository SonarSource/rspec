== Why is this an issue?

Exception specifications never really provided any advantages in {cpp}. They have been deprecated since {cpp}11, and removed since {cpp}17 (specification with an exception) and {cpp}20 (empty throw specification). If your code still contains some, you should replace empty ``++throw()++`` specifications, with ``++noexcept++`` and remove any other specifications.


=== Noncompliant code example

[source,cpp]
----
void f() throw(); // Noncompliant
void g() throw(std::exception); // Noncompliant
----


=== Compliant solution

[source,cpp]
----
void f() noexcept;
void g();
----


=== Exceptions

If a derived class overrides a function with a dynamic exception specification, then the derived function is forced to add a compatible exception specification. Such exception specifications are ignored.
