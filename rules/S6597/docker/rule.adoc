== Why is this an issue?

In single Dockerfile instructions like `RUN`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT` multiple commands can be run, including the `cd` command for changing directories.
Using `WORKDIR` instead reduces the complexity of the above instructions and makes them easy to read, understand, troubleshoot, and maintain.

=== What is the potential impact?

The Dockerfile instructions like `RUN` allow users to execute longer scripts. See the following example:

[source,docker]
----
RUN cd /tmp && \
  git clone myrepository.com/MyOrganization/project && \
  cd project && \
  make && \
  cd /app/bin
----

In this example, the first `cd /tmp` command can be replaced by `WORKDIR cd /tmp` put above `RUN`.
The last `cd /app/bin` command can be replaced too.
The result will be following:

[source,docker]
----
WORKDIR /tmp
RUN git clone myrepository.com/MyOrganization/project && \
  cd project && \
  make
WORKDIR /app/bin
----

Those actions will reduce the length of the `RUN` instruction, which makes it easier to read and understand.
Sometimes, it is hard to avoid the usage of `cd` command, especially in the middle of a long script.
Removing them from the beginning and end of a multi-line is an easy improvement.
Additionally, a lot of commands work well with absolute paths, so changing directories can be avoided in most cases.

The `WORKDIR` instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile.
It changes the current directory for the next instructions and until there is a following change.
This approach simplifies understanding of what is a current directory.

The same principles apply to `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions.
Following this recommendation provides a clear structure for Dockerfiles, making it easier to maintain.

== How to fix it

Where possible, ensure that all usages of `cd` commands are replaced by a `WORKDIR` instruction.
The `cd` commands at the beginning or end of multiline commands are a reliable sign, that they can be replaced.
Also, using absolute paths can be considered for commands that accept them.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
RUN cd /app/bin && ./start.sh
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,docker,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
WORKDIR app/bin
RUN ./start.sh
----
