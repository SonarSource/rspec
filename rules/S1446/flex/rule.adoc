A dynamic class defines an object that can be altered at run time by adding or changing properties and methods. This extremely powerful mechanism should be used very carefully, and only in very limited use cases. 


Indeed, by definition dynamic classes make refactoring difficult and prevent the compiler from raising potential errors at compile time.
