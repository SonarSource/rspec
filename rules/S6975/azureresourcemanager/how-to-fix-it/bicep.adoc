*Recommended order of the resource elements and decorators*:

----
@description
@batchSize
resource resourceName
  parent
  scope
  name
  location/extendedLocation
  zones
  sku
  kind
  scale
  plan
  identity
  dependsOn
  tags
  properties
----

Any other decorated not listed here should be placed before the `resource` object and after the other decorators.
