Using host operating system namespaces can lead to compromise of the host systems. +
These attacks would target:

* host processes
* host inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms
* network services of the local host system

These three items likely include systems that support either the internal
operation of the Kubernetes cluster or the enterprise's internal
infrastructure.

Opening these points to containers opens new attack surfaces for attackers who
have already successfully exploited services exposed by containers. Depending
on how resilient the cluster is, attackers can extend their attack to the
cluster by compromising the nodes from which the cluster started the process.

Host network sharing could provide a significant performance advantage for
workloads that require critical network performance. However, the successful
exploitation of this attack vector could have a catastrophic impact on
confidentiality within the cluster.

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The services of this Pod are accessible to people who are not administrators of the Kubernetes cluster.
* The cluster's services performances do *not* rely on operating system namespaces.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Do not use host operating system namespaces.

== Sensitive Code Example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
  hostPID: true     # Sensitive
  hostIPC: true     # Sensitive
  hostNetwork: true # Sensitive
