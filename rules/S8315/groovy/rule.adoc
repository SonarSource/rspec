This rule raises an issue when an empty string literal is concatenated with another value using the `+` operator.

== Why is this an issue?

Concatenating an empty string with another value is an inefficient way to convert that value to a string. This pattern creates unnecessary string objects and obscures the developer's intent.

In Groovy, when you use `'' + someValue`, the runtime must:

* Create a new empty string object
* Convert `someValue` to a string representation
* Concatenate the empty string with the converted value
* Return the result

This approach is less efficient than direct string conversion methods and makes the code less readable. The intent (converting a value to a string) is not immediately clear to other developers reading the code.

Moreover, this pattern can lead to unexpected behavior with null values, as `'' + null` results in the string `"null"` rather than an empty string or a null pointer exception that might be more appropriate depending on the context.

=== What is the potential impact?

This pattern reduces code performance due to unnecessary object creation and string operations. It also decreases code readability and maintainability, making it harder for developers to understand the intended behavior. In performance-critical applications or when processing large amounts of data, these inefficiencies can accumulate and impact overall application performance.

== How to fix it

Replace empty string concatenation with explicit `toString()` calls. For potentially null values, use safe navigation with null coalescing to handle null cases appropriately.

=== Code examples

==== Noncompliant code example

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=noncompliant]
----
def a = '' + 123
def b = method('' + property)
def c = someValue + ''
def d = "" + expression.getValue()
----

==== Compliant solution

[source,groovy,diff-id=1,diff-type=compliant]
----
def a = 123.toString()
def b = method(property?.toString() ?: "")
def c = someValue.toString()
def d = expression.getValue()?.toString() ?: ""
----
