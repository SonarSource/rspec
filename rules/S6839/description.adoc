HTTP Response Splitting is a type of web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates the data input into HTTP headers. This manipulation can lead to the creation of additional, unauthorized HTTP responses. The vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is not properly validated and sanitized before being included in an HTTP response header. This can potentially allow an attacker to control the contents of the HTTP response received by other users, leading to a variety of malicious activities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, or even defacement of the website.

This rule focusses on HTTP header injection where response splitting is possible. For this, an attacker needs to be able to inject Line Feed characters in the returned header value.

== Why is this an issue?

HTTP Response Splitting is a significant security concern due to its potential to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of web applications and their users' data. Here are some scenarios that illustrate why this vulnerability is dangerous:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): When an attacker successfully exploits an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability, they can inject malicious scripts into the HTTP response. These scripts can be executed in the user's browser, leading to an XSS attack. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive user data, such as login credentials or personal information.
* Session Hijacking: In this scenario, the attacker can manipulate the HTTP response to set or modify cookies. This can lead to session hijacking, where the attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session, potentially leading to identity theft or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
* Website Defacement: By controlling the HTTP response, an attacker can alter the appearance and content of a web page. This can harm the reputation of the website and cause users to lose trust in the site's security.
* Phishing Attacks: An attacker can use this vulnerability to redirect users to a malicious website that looks identical to the original one. Unaware users might provide sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details, thinking they are on a legitimate site.

In all these scenarios, the attacker leverages the HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability to manipulate the data received by the user, leading to potential data theft, unauthorized access, and loss of user trust in the application.
