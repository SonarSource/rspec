== How to fix it

As a best practice, applications that construct response headers using user-provided data should always implement rigorous validation of this data. Ideally, this validation should be based on a whitelist of acceptable inputs. This ensures that only approved, safe data is included in the response header, significantly reducing the risk of HTTP Response Splitting and other injection vulnerabilities.
