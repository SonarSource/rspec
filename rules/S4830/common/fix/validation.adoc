Addressing the vulnerability of disabled TLS certificate validation primarily
involves re-enabling the validation. However, it is important to be aware that
there might be times when you need to work with self-signed certificates, or
certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) not included in the standard
trusted root CAs of your environment. In these cases, the solution is not to
disable certificate validation in your code, but to manage your trusted CAs
appropriately. 

==== Using trusted certificates

If possible, always use a certificate issued by a well-known, trusted CA for
your server. Most programming environments come with a predefined list of
trusted root CAs, and certificates issued by these authorities are validated
automatically. This is the best practice, and it requires no additional code or
configuration.

==== Working with self-signed certificates or non-standard CAs

In some cases, you might need to work with a server using a self-signed
certificate, or a certificate issued by a CA not included in your trusted roots.
Rather than disabling certificate validation in your code, you can add the
necessary certificates to your trust store.
