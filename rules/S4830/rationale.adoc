Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides secure communication between systems
over the internet by encrypting the data sent between them. Certificate validation 
adds an extra layer of trust and security to this process to ensure that a system 
is indeed the one it claims to be.

When certificate validation is disabled, the client skips a critical security check.
This creates an opportunity for attackers to pose as a trusted entity and
intercept, manipulate, or steal the data being transmitted.
