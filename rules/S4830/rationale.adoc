Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides secure communication between systems
over the internet by encrypting the data sent between them. The role of
certificate validation in this process is to ensure that a system is indeed the
one it claims to be, adding an extra layer of trust and security.

When certificate validation is disabled, the client skips this critical check.
This creates an opportunity for attackers to pose as a trusted entity and
intercept, manipulate, or steal the data being transmitted.
