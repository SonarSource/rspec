This is a file with `valid inlined code`.
It's using ``unconstrained tag``s.
It has ``++**protected tags**++``
It escapes `++`++` backquotes
it can use `\` or `+`

Plays well with beginning and end of lines:
`++`++`

Mix of passthrough and plusses `+{plus}##+{plus}+`

:var: ``Variables are not interpreted`

{var}

We can use passthrough macros `pass:[__like that__]`

Or we can use passthrough macros `as a pass:[__part__] of the code`.

The pass:[can also be outside `__the backquotes__`]

The pass:[``++Can have __ [escaped brackets\] __ ++``]

[source,python]
----
# We don't care about `in the code

We also don't care about writing C++ or c++

----

Inside descriptions, we only use {cpp} to refer to the language

We can have a sole ` surrounded by spaces

This file does not exist but we only check that the include is well placed:

include::everything_ok.adoc[]

For `constrained*format` we don't raise an issue unless `+*it's+ at the beginning or end of a +~word~+`.
