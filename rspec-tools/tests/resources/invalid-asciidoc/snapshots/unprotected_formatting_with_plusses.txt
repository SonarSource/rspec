$PATH/unprotected_formatting_with_plusses.adoc:1 
Using backquotes does not protect against asciidoc interpretation. Starting or
ending a word with '*', '#', '_' or having two of them consecutively will
trigger unintended behavior with the rest of the text.
Use ``++This is not + ##protected## +++`` to avoid that.
If you really want to have formatting inside your code, you can write
``pass:n[This is not + ##protected## +]``
