Using garbage values will cause the program to behave
nondeterministically at runtime.
The program may produce a different output or crash depending on the run.

In some situations, loading a variable may expose a sensitive data,
such as a password that was previously stored in the same location,
leading to a vulnerability that uses such a defect
as a gadget for extracting information from the instance
of the program.

Finally, in {cpp}, outside of a few exceptions related to the uses of `unsigned char` or `std::byte`,
loading data from an uninitialized variable causes undefined behavior.
This means that the compiler is not bound by the language standard anymore,
and the program has no meaning assigned to it.
As a consequence,
the impact of such a defect is not limited to the use of garbage values.
