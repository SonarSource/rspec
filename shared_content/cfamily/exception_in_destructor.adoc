Throwing an exception from a destructor may result in a call to `std::terminate`.

== Why is this an issue?

Destructors are, by default, implicitly declared as `noexcept` such that `std::terminate` is called when they exit with an exception.
Destructors may still propagate an exception if they are explicitly declared as `noexcept(false)`.
However, even a destructor declared as `noexcept(false)` calls `std::terminate` when it throws during stack unwinding.

In all cases, `std::terminate` results in an implementation-defined, abrupt, and unclean program termination.

The following example illustrates the severity of the underlying problem:

The destructor of a container needs to call the destructors for all managed objects.
Suppose a call to an object's destructor throws an exception.
In that case, there are only two _conceptual_ ways to proceed:

1. Abort the destruction.
   This results in a partially destroyed object and possibly many more objects whose destructors are never called.
2. Ignore the exception and proceed with destroying the remaining objects.
   However, this potentially results in more partially destroyed objects if further destructors throw an exception.

Because both options are undesired, the behavior is undefined whenever an object managed by a {cpp} standard container throws an exception.

Thus, destructors should never `throw` exceptions.
Instead, they should catch and handle those thrown by the functions they call and be `noexcept`.
