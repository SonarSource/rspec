In {cpp}, manually allocating and deallocating memory is considered a code smell.

It is recommended to follow the _RAII_ idiom and create a class that manages the memory by allocating it when the object is constructed and freeing it when it is destroyed.
Furthermore, copy and move operations on such objects are designed such that this object can be passed by value between functions (either as an argument or by being returned)
in place of raw pointers.

Depending on the type, passing an _RAII_ object operations may either:

- Allocate a new block of memory and copy the elements (`std::vector`).
- Transfer ownership of the memory to constructed object (`std::unique_ptr`).
- Use shared ownership and free memory when the last object is destroyed (`std::shared_ptr`).
