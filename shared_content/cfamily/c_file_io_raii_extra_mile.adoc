Following this idiom, one would create a class that manages the underlying file by opening it when the object is constructed and closing it when the object is destroyed, effectively using a constructor-destructor pair as a "do-undo"-mechanism.

An exemplary class that manages a pointer to a file is shown in what follows.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <cstdio>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <utility>

// Although `std::fstream` should be preferred, if available, a file stream
// managed by this `File` class cannot suffer from "double-close" issues.
class File {
  FILE *f;

public:
  // Opens file stream on construction.
  File(std::string const &path, std::string const &modes)
      : f(fopen(path.c_str(), modes.c_str())) {
    if (!f) {
      throw std::ios_base::failure("fopen() failed");
    }
  }
  // Will close the file stream upon destruction.
  ~File() {
    // Here we are fine with `std::terminate` being called here in case `close`
    // throws and exception.
    close();
  }
  // Allow only one owner of a file, disallow copy operations.
  File(const File &other) = delete;
  File &operator=(const File &other) = delete;
  // Moving a file to a different scope shall be allowed.
  File(File &&other) : f(std::exchange(other.f, nullptr)) {}
  File &operator=(File &&other) {
    if (this != &other) {
      // In case of non-self-assignment, close the currently managed file and
      // "steal" the other's file.
      close();
      f = std::exchange(other.f, nullptr);
    }
    return *this;
  }
  // Allow file to be closed explicitly.
  void close() {
    if (f != nullptr && fclose(std::exchange(f, nullptr)) == EOF) {
      throw std::ios_base::failure("fclose() failed");
    }
  }
  // Allow access to underlying file via `f`.
  FILE *handle() { return f; }
  // Release `f`, i.e., stop managing it.
  FILE *release() { return std::exchange(f, nullptr); }
};

void file_user() {
  File fh{"example.txt", "r"};
  FILE *f = fh.handle();
  // Use `f` for the desired file operation(s).
  //
  // The file stream managed by `fh` will be automatically closed when `fh` goes
  // out of scope at the end of this function.
}
