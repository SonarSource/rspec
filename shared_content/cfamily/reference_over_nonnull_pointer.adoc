In {cpp}, it is preferred to use reference parameters (Type const& or Type&), or pass objects by value (Type), instead of a pointer (Type const* or Type*), if the argument is expected to never be null.

[source,cpp]
----
// Precondition: graph != null
bool isDAG(Graph const* graph);
---- 

The preferred signature would be:

[source,cpp]
----
bool isDAG(Graph const& graph);
----
