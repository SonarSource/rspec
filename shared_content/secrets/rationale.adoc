In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don't need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.

The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people's role and
entitlement.
