==== Compromise of sensitive data

If the affected service is used to store or process personally identifiable
information or other sensitive data, attackers knowing an authentication secret
could be able to access it. Depending on the type of data that is compromised,
it could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or other
negative outcomes.

In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a
reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.
