==== Dataviz Corruption and Takeover

With control over the {service_name} application, the attacker can modify
dashboards, alter data sources, or inject malicious code. This can result in the
manipulation of displayed data, misleading visualizations, or even the
introduction of backdoors for further exploitation.

The attacker may even attempt to escalate their privileges within the
{service_name} environment. By gaining administrative access or higher-level
permissions, they can perform more significant actions, such as modifying access
controls, adding or deleting users, or changing system configurations.
