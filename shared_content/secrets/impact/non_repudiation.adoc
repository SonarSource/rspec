==== Breach of trust in non-repudiation and disruption of the audit trail

When such a secret is compromised, malicious actors might have the possibility
to send malicious event objects, causing discrepancies in the audit trail. This
can make it difficult to trace and verify the sequence of events, impacting the
ability to investigate and identify unauthorized or fraudulent activity.

All in all, this can lead to problems in proving the validity of transactions
or actions performed, potentially leading to disputes and legal complications.
