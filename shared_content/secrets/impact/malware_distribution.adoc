==== Malware distribution

Due to this vulnerability, malware can be stored and spread, both to users of
the service and to other potential targets. +
A malware depends on the attacker's intentions, as the following examples show:

* Cryptojacking malware, whose goal is to "mine" cryptocurrencies on the affected computers or servers.
* Spyware that spies out sensitive information from victims.

In the worst case, malware can cause the target systems to be completely
compromised and allow attackers to infiltrate the systems.
