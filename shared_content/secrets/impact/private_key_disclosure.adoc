==== Cryptographic private key disclosure 

A cryptographic private key is a piece of sensitive information that is used in
asymmetric cryptography. They are used in conjunction with public keys to secure
communications and authenticate digital signatures.

Private keys can be used to achieve two main cryptographic operations,
encryption or digital signature. Those operations are the basis of multiple
higher-level security mechanisms such as:

* User authentication
* Servers authentication, for example in the X509 trust model
* Email encryption

Disclosing a cryptographic private key to an unintended audience can have severe
security consequences. The exact impact will vary depending on the role of the
key and the assets it protects.

For example, if the key is used in conjunction with an X509 certificate to
authenticate a web server as part of TLS communications, attackers with network access will be able
to impersonate that server. This leads to Man-In-The-Middle-Attacks that would
affect both the confidentiality and integrity of the communications from clients
to that server.

If the key was used as part of email protocols, attackers might be able to send
emails on behalf of the key owner or decrypt previously encrypted emails. This
might lead to sensitive information disclosure and reputation loss.
