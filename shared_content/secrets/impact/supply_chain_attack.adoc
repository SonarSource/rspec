==== Supply chain attacks

If the leaked secret gives an attacker the ability to publish code to private packages or repositories under the name of the organization, then there may exist grave consequences beyond the compromise of source code. The attacker may inject malware, backdoors, or other harmful code into these private repositories.

This can cause further security breaches inside the organization, but will also affect clients if the malicious code gets added to any products. Distributing code that (unintentionally) contains backdoors or malware can lead to widespread security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.
