Unauthorized access to mailing service API keys can also result in resource
abuse. Attackers can exploit the API keys to send a large volume of spam emails
or perform other resource-intensive operations, causing a significant strain on
the mailing service provider's infrastructure. 

The service provider, being vigilant about such activities, may flag your
account and take action against it. This could lead to the suspension or
termination of the compromised account, thus causing significant inconvenience
and potential loss of communication with your customers or partners.
