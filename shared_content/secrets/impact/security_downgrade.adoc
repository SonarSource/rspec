==== Application's security downgrade

A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect
security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the
affected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive
information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting server
or another linked component.

For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user
authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation. An
attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary
users and take over their privileges and entitlements.
