==== Financial loss

Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.

This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.

Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application's
users.
