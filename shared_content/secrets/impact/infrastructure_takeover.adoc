==== Infrastructure takeover

By obtaining a leaked secret, an attacker can gain control over your organization's {service_name} infrastructure. They can modify DNS settings, redirect traffic, or launch malicious instances that can be used for various nefarious activities, including launching DDoS attacks, hosting phishing websites, or distributing malware. Malicious instances may also be used for resource-intensive tasks such as cryptocurrency mining. 

This can result in legal liability, but also increased costs, degraded performance, and potential service disruptions.

Furthermore, corporate {service_name} infrastructures are often connected to other services and to the internal networks of the organization. Because of this, cloud infrastructure is often used by attackers as a gateway to other assets. Attackers can leverage this gateway to gain access to more services, to compromise more business-critical data and to cause more damage to the overall infrastructure.
