==== Phishing and spam

An attacker can use this {secret_type} to spam users or lure them into links to
a malicious domain controlled by the attacker.

Spam can cause users to be exposed to the following:

* Unsolicited, inappropriate content, such as pornographic material
* Fraudulent attempts to trick users into sending information or money
* Abusive or hateful statements
* False advertising or fraudulent claims

Once a user has been phished on a legitimate-seeming third-party website, an
attacker can collect the user’s credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication
(MFA), and take over the user’s account on the trusted website.
