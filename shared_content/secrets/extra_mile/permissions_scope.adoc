==== Reducing the permission scope per secret

By reducing the permission scope, the token is granted only the minimum set of permissions required to perform its intended tasks. This follows the principle of least privilege, which states that a user or token should have only the necessary privileges to carry out its specific functions. By adhering to this principle, the potential attack surface is minimized, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive resources.

Additionally, if a token is compromised, the reduced permissions scope limits the potential damage that can be done. With fewer permissions, the attacker's ability to access or modify critical resources is restricted, reducing the impact of the compromise.
