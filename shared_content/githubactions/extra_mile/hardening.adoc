==== Security hardening

Beyond fixing the immediate security issue, consider implementing additional security measures:

* **Minimal permissions**: Configure workflows to use the minimum necessary permissions by explicitly setting `permissions` for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and avoiding overly broad access.
* **Branch protection**: Implement branch protection rules that require code review for changes to workflow files, preventing unauthorized modifications.
* **External contributor restrictions**: Configure workflows to require approval for runs triggered by external contributors, reducing the risk of malicious workflow executions.
