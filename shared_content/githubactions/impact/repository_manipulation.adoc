==== Repository manipulation

Attackers may be able to:

* Modify repository contents or history
* Create unauthorized releases or tags
* Access or modify other repositories the workflow has access to

The impact is particularly severe because GitHub Actions runners often have elevated privileges and access to sensitive resources, making them attractive targets for attackers.
