==== Fixing vulnerabilities only in the main branch

It is important to note that fixing this vulnerability requires updating the workflow files in all existing branches of the repository. GitHub Actions workflows can be triggered from any branch, and an attacker could potentially target vulnerable workflows in older or feature branches. A comprehensive fix should include updating all branches that contain the vulnerable workflow patterns.
